& 2012-13  -3- 2.5 Without prejudice to the above,on the facts and in the
circumstances of the case and in-law, the learned CIT(A) grossly erred in
sustaining the addition at the rate of 2% towards Corporate Guarantee

3\. Re: Addition on account of Sale of Pantoprazote to Sun Pharma Global BVI
and Sun Pharma Global FZE - Rs. 3,61,21,85,376/-:
3.1 The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in rejecting the benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract
manufacturer having regard to the functions carried, the assets deployed and
risks undertaken by the Appellant in the transaction.
3.2 The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in classifying the sales made by the Appellant without appreciating the
fact that the US PDA Para under which the product is filed is irrelevant for
the Appellant who is a contract manufacturer.
3.3 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in
upholding the order of TPO , who has wrongly applied profit split method as
the most appropriate method without referring to any external comparable
benchmarks.
3.4 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in
enhancing the profit allocation to Appellant from 50:50 to 80:20 without
understanding the nature of the transaction and by making arbitrary
allocations under completely mistaken beliefs by ignoring the fact that the
Appellant was merely a contract manufacturer.
3.5 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in not
appreciating that the IPR belonged to the AE and having regard to the fact
that the product was Para IV product the AE was exposed to significant risks
inherent in the transaction and accordingly the profit allocation for the IPR
to the AE was extremely low and unjustified.
3.6 Without prejudice to the above,even if the profit split method is to be
followed, the Assessing Officer grossly erred in upholding the order of the
TPO who made addition without appreciating the fact that there is nil profit
to be attributed to the Appellant since the entire profit earned by the AE on
the sale of the Products in USA is wiped off on account of subsequent
infringement claim of USD 506 Mn.
3.7 Without Prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) grossly erred in
upholding the order of Assessing Officer/TPO who made addition without
appreciating the fact the full infringement loss ought to be deducted against
the profits of the AE derived from the sale of Para IV products and only the
profits / loss after such adjustment, if any should be split between the
Appellant and the AE.
3.8 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) grossly erred in not
allowing the relief of infringement claim of Rs. 1,42,52,16,938/- given by TPO
while working out the profit from the transaction for the purpose of profit
split.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

& 2012-13  -4- 3.9 Without prejudice to the above,if profit split method is to
be followed, the ratios of 50:50 ought to be adopted for benchmarking of sales
of products.

Pantoprazole to Sun Pharma Global BVI and Sun Pharma Global FZE - Rs.
1,16,85,18,972/-:
4.1 The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in rejecting the benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract
manufacturer having regard to the functions carried, the assets deployed and
risks undertaken by the Appellant in the transaction.
4.2 The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in classifying the sales made by the Appellant having regard to the
relevant Para of the US FDA under which the approval was sought without
appreciating the fact that the US FDA Para under which the product is filed is
irrelevant for the Appellant who is a contract manufacturer.
4.3 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in
upholding the order of TPO who has wrongly applied profit split method as the
most appropriate method without referring to any external comparable
benchmarks.
4.4 Without prejudice to the above,the learned CIT(A) has erred in not
appreciating that the IPR belonged to the AE along with the possible risk
attached thereto and so the AE was exposed to significant transaction risks
and accordingly the profit allocation for the IPR to the AE was extremely low
and unjustified.
4.5. Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in
upholding the order of TPO who has benchmarked the sales of Para IV product
(other than sale of Pantaprazole) in ratio of 80:20 without appreciating that
the Appellant is a contract manufacturer.
4.6 Without prejudice to the above, if profit split method is to be followed,
the ratios of 50:50 ought to be adopted for benchmarking of sales of products.
5\. Re: Addition on account of Sale of Non-Para IV products to Sun Pharma
Global BVI and Sun Pharma Global FZE - Rs. 21,34,71,777/-:
5.1. The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in rejecting the benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract
manufacturer having regard to the functions carried, the assets deployed and
risks undertaken by the Appellant in the transaction.
5.2. The learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of TPO who
erred in classifying the sales made by the Appellant having regard to the
relevant Para of the US FDA under which the approval was sought without
appreciating the fact that ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13  -5- the US FDA Para under
which the product is filed is irrelevant for the Appellant who is a contract
manufacturer.
5.3. Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT{A) has grossly erred in
upholding the order of TPO who has wrongly applied profit split method as the
most appropriate method without referring to any external comparable
benchmarks.
5.4. Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT(A) has erred in not
appreciating that the IPR rests with the AE and the AE was exposed to
significant risks inherent in the transaction and accordingly the profit
allocation for the IPR to the AE was extremely low and unjustified.
5.5. Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT(A) has grossly erred in
upholding the order of TPO who has benchmarked the sales of Non-Para IV
products in ratio of 80:20 without appreciating that Appellant is merely a
contract manufacturer.

the ratios of 50:50 ought to be adopted for benchmarking of sales of products.
6\. Re: Non-allowance of weighted deduction u/s 35(2AB):
6.1. On the facts arid in the circumstances of the case the learned CIT(A)
grossly erred in not allowing the claim of the Appellant of weighted deduction
u/s 35(2AB) on the ground that Appellant had not claimed the deduction in the
return of income without appreciating that the jurisdiction of the appellate
authorities to consider a fresh or new ground or claim is not restricted and
that the Appellant can take up additional grounds at any stage during the
assessment proceedings.
6.2. On the facts and in circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) grossly
erred in denying the additional claim of weighted deduction on the ground that
the issue was a question of facts and not a question of law.
6.3. On the facts and in circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) failed
to appreciate that once R&D facilities were approved, entire expenditure
incurred for R&D activities towards in house research and development was
eligible for weighted deduction under section 35(2AB).
7\. Re: Disallowance on account of R&D expenses incurred by the Appellant
alleged to have been incurred for products manufactured by partnership firms
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (SPI) and Sun Pharma Sikkim (SPS) debited in the
books of the Appellant:
7.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT(A) grossly erred in upholding the actions of the Assessing Officer
relating to allocation of R&D expenditure, without appreciating that:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13  -6- 1 The product technologies developed are completely
> owned by the Appellant and that no part of the ownership of the product
> technologies or processes developed during such R&D work is pertains to any
> other party;
2 The decision to manufacture a product at a particular location was based on
business and commercial expediency and the manufacturing of the same at the
factory of SPI and SPS was part of the obligation undertaken by the Appellant
under the partnership deed as a working partner;
3 The Appellant being an active partner, in pursuance of the obligation
undertaken by the Appellant under the partnership deed, had provided technical
assistance in relation to the manufacturing activities and that no R&D
activity was carried out for SPI and SPS. The Appellant was receiving
remuneration and share in profit from SPI and SPS for the services rendered by
it.
7.2 Without prejudice to the above,the learned C1T(A) grossly erred in
allocating proportionate R&D expenditure incurred to SPI and SPS without
appreciating that the same is allowable to the Appellant u/s 35(2AB).
7.3 Without prejudice to the above,learned CIT(A) erred in not following the
CIT(A) order passed in the case of Appellant for earlier years where it was
considered that since the Appellant already has its infrastructure in place,
only the incremental expenditure incurred by the Appellant after partnership
firm came into existence ought to be disallowed.
7.4 Without prejudice to the above,the CIT(A) grossly erred in computing the
amount of research and development expenditure attributable to the development
of formulation drugs for the domestic market at Rs. 6343.53 lakhs against the
correct amount of Rs. 2332.84 lakhs 7.5 Without prejudice to the above,
similar issue has been considered by the Assessing Officer at the time of tax
assessment of partnership firms SPI and SPS wherein the disallowance was
restricted to Rs. 35.13 lakhs in case of SPI and Nil in case of SPS, and
accordingly in the case of Appellant disallowance ought to be restricted on
the same. * 7.6 Without prejudice to the above,the R&D expense should not be
allocated on the basis of domestic formulation turnover as both the entities
operate in different market segments with different underlying facts.
7.7 Without prejudice to the aboveand without accepting any disallowance of
the expenses, the Assessing Officer should have restricted the disallowance
towards expenses as provided u/s 14A read with Rule 8D.
7.8 Without prejudice to the above, the disallowance ought to be substantially
reduced.
7.9 Without prejudice to the above, the deduction u/s. 10B ought to be
increased on account of allocation of R&D expenses to SPI.

& 2012-13  -7-
8\. Re: Deduction of Remuneration received from Partnership firm for
determination of Book Profits u/s. 115JB - Rs 15,07,27,535/-:
8.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT (A) erred in not allowing deduction for remuneration received from
partnership firm to which provisions of section 10 applies for determination
of book profit under section 115JB, without appreciating that remuneration
received from partnership firm was nothing but appropriation of profits.
8.2 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT(A) failed to appreciate that entire framework of computing book profits is
based on normal commercial profits having regard to relevant accounting
framework prescribed in Companies Act and thus remuneration is eligible to be
deducted for computing book profits as per explanation (ii) to section 115JB
(2) read with Chapter III of the Act.
8.3 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT (A) grossly erred in alleging that appellant attempted to avoid tax
without appreciating that the appellant had merely applied the provisions of
the taxing statute.
9\. Re: Reduction of unrealized export proceeds of Rs. 40,64,118/- from export
turnover for the purpose of deduction u/s. 10B:
9.1 The learned CIT(A) grossly erred in upholding reduction in deduction u/s
10B on account of unrealized export proceeds without appreciating that the
Appellant has already received approval from the Reserve Bank of India for
extension of the realization period.
10\. Re: Disallowance of expenditure on repairs of Rs. 16,82,791/- treating
them as capital expenditure:
10.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned CIT(A)
grossly erred in confirming the disallowance of repairs expenditure amounting
to Rs. 16,82,791/- treating the expenditures as capital expenditure on the
allegation that some of the expenditure is incurred on parts of the plant &
machinery which can function independently. The learned CIT(A) ought to have
appreciated that the expenditure on repairs has been incurred to maintain
existing assets and not for creating new assets or results in benefit of
enduring nature.
11\. Re: Disallowance u/s 14A read with Rule 8D -
11.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT (A) erred in confirming the action of the Assessing Officer of making
disallowance u/s.!4A read with rule 8D, without appreciating that:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13  -8- 1 The income earned by the appellant on its
> investment in partnership firm was not exempt andhence was not to be
> considered for disallowance under section 14A;
2 Section 14A was not applicable in instant case since Assessing Officer
failed to establishsatisfaction as to how the claim of the Appellant was
incorrect;
3 Provisions of section 14A could not be made applicable to investments which
are capable ofgenerating taxable income;
4 The Appellant had sufficient interest free funds to carry out investments
and hence no borrowedfunds were utilized for purpose of investments;
5 Provisions of section 14A could not be made applicable to the investments in
partnership firm asthey been strategic investments.
11.2 Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT (A) grossly erred in riot
rectifying the errors made by the Assessing Officer while computing the
disallowance under section 14A read with rule 8D.
12\. Re: Addition of expense disallowed u/s 14A for computing book profit u/s
115JB:
12.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT (A) grossly erred in considering the amount disallowed under section 14A
for investment in partnership firm while computing book profit under section
115JB, without appreciating that:
1 The income earned by the appellant on its investment in partnership firm was
not exempt andhence was not to be considered for disallowance under section
14A;
2 Section 14A was not applicable in instant case since Assessing Officer
failed to establishsatisfaction that expenditure has been incurred for earning
exempt income;
3 Provisions of section 14A could not be made applicable to investments which
are capable ofgenerating taxable income;
4 The Appellant had sufficient interest free funds to carry out investments
and hence no borrowedfunds were utilized for purpose of investments;
5 Provisions of section 14A could not be made applicable to the investments in
partnership firm asthey been strategic investments;
12.2 The CIT(A) failed to appreciate that in absence of direct and specific
expenditure incurred for earning the exempt income no addition of the amount
disallowed u/s. 14A read with Rule 8D to the book profit was warranted.
12.3 The CIT(A) failed to appreciate that the provisions of sec.115JB and sec.
14A are deeming provisions enacted under the Income Tax Act which have are to
be ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017
(By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
2010-11 & 2012-13  -9- made operative only to the extent of the deeming
fiction created therein. The CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that both sec.
115JB and sec. 14A are mutually exclusive and there ought not to be any
disallowance of amount disallowed u/s. 14A while computing the book profit
u/s. 115JB.
12.4 Without prejudice to the above, the learned CIT (A) grossly erred in
importing provisions of subsection (2) and (3) of section 14A into explanation
to section 115JB without appreciating the decided case laws on the subject.
13\. Re: Addition of Selling and Distribution expense incurred on behalf of
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ("SPI") disallowed u/s 14A:
13.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT(A) erred in disallowing Selling and Distribution expenditure incurred by
the Appellant u/s. 14A on the ground that the said expenditure is directly
incurred by the Appellant for the partnership firm without appreciating that:
1 Selling and distribution expenditure were directly incurred by the Appellant
for the purposes of itsbusiness activities and it could not be termed and
categorized to be directly incurred for earningthe exempt income under Rule
8D;
2 The selling and distribution expenditure to be disallowed as worked out by
the Assessing Officer isdetermined arbitrarily in the ratio of turnover and
has no direct nexus towards the exemptincome earned by the Appellant;
3 The CIT(A) has failed to substantiate and demonstrate its claim that the
said expenditure isdirectly incurred by the Appellant towards earning of
exempt income;
4 . The said expenditure was incurred by the Appellant for the purpose of the
business of theAppellant and not merely for the purposes of earning profit;
5 The provisions of section 14A could not be made applicable to investments
which are capable ofgenerating taxable income; and 6 The investment made by
the Appellant in the partnership firm Is strategic in nature and not forthe
purpose of earning exempt income.
13.2 Without Prejudice to the above, the CIT(A) grossly erred in disallowing
the selling and distribution expenses u/s. 14A without appreciating the fact
that the CIT(A) himself has during the appellateproceedings enhanced the
income of the Appellant by re-characterizing the remuneration earned by the
Appellant as royalty income. The CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that if the
income was sought to be re-characterized as royalty, then the expenditure
incurred to earn such income ought to be allowed as deduction.
13.3 Without prejudice to the above, the disallowance u/s. 14A ought to be
substantially reduced.

14.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
CIT (A) grossly erred in initiating penalty proceedings u/s. 271(1)(c) on
various grounds on which the enhancement was made,
15\. The Appellant craves leave to add to, alter, amend or delete any ground
of appeal at or before the hearing of this appeal.
5\. The 1st issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 1 is general and does
not require any separate adjudication. Therefore we dismissed the same.
6\. The second issue raised by the assessee is that the Ld.CIT (A) erred in
confirming the order of the AO/TPO by sustaining the disallowance of Rs.
8,94,313/- on account of corporate guarantee provided to its associated
enterprises.
6.1 The facts of the case are that the assessee in the present case is a
limited company and engaged in the business of manufacturing, trading, and
exports of pharmaceutical drugs, formulations, leasing of equipment and
financing. The assessee during the year has given a corporate guarantee to
banks on behalf of its various associated enterprises as detailed below:

i) It has not incurred any expense for providing the corporate guarantee to
the banks on behalf of the associated enterprise. As such the corporate
guarantee was provided as a measure of long-term commitment towards the
subsidiary companies. Accordingly, the assessee has shifted its burden of
providing financial resources to its associated enterprise to the banks.
ii) It is an undisputed fact that the subsidiary company availing the loan
from the bank is an associated concern of the assessee. Thus there exist an
implicit guarantee which is always available to the associated enterprise. As
such there was no impact on the loan provided by the bank on account of
explicit guarantee provided by it. It is because the associate enterprise was
capable of availing the loan facilities from the bank. There was also no
benefit to the associate enterprise on account of the credit rating of the
assessee.

& 2012-13
\- 12 -
iii) There were sufficient tangible assets available with the associate
enterprises, and the assessee will be liable to make the payment to the bank
in the event of default by the associated enterprise. As there were sufficient
tangible assets with the associate enterprise, then there was no risk upon the
assessee on account of furnishing the corporate guarantee to the bank.
iv) There was no economic benefit received by the assessee against the
corporate guarantee provided to its associated enterprise. Thus the cost for
such corporate guarantee will remain nil.
v) The nature of the liability on account of furnishing the corporate
guarantee is a notional liability which was disclosed in the annual accounts.
The bank has not invoked the corporate guarantee provided by it to the
associate enterprise during the year.
vi) In case any addition is warranted on account of profit, then it should not
exceed more than 0.25% per annum. Thus the rate proposed by the TPO i.e. 3.85%
which is based on the difference between the AA rated US bonds and the BB-
rated US bond was not correct.
vii) Without prejudice to the above, the assessee also submitted that the AO
in the assessment year 2008-09 had charged such ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017
(By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 13 -
corporate guarantee commission at the rate of 2% per annum. Thus the rate for
the corporate guarantee in the year under consideration should not exceed more
than 2% per annum.
7\. However, the TPO rejected the contention of the assessee and worked out
the guarantee fee at the rate of 3.85% per annum by yield method amounting to
Rs. 8,94,313/- and added to the total income of the assessee.
8\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who has confirmed
the order of the AO/TPO partly after having a reliance on the order of his
predecessor pertaining to the assessment year 2008-09 and 2009-10.
9\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld. CIT (A), both the assessee and the
Revenue are in appeal before us. The assessee is in appeal before us against
the confirmation of the addition of corporate guarantee fees up to 2% whereas
the Revenue is in appeal before us against the reduction of the addition of
corporate guarantee fee from 2.96% to 2%.
9.1 The ground of appeal raised by the Revenue read as under:
"2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, Ld.CIT (A) erred in law
and facts in reducing the adjustment on account of ALP for Corporate Guarantee
Fees from 2.96% to 2% since ALP for each year is assessed on the basis of risk
factor of that particular year and said ALP was worked out on the basis of
Country and foreign exchange risk."

10\. The Ld. AR before us filed a paper book running from pages 1 to 253 and
submitted that in the identical facts and circumstances in the own case of the
assessee and Revenue bearing ITA Nos. 1666/AHD/2016 and 1663/AHD/2016
pertaining to AY 2009-2010, the ITAT was pleased to restore the issue to the
Ld. CIT (A) for fresh adjudication vide order dated 08-09-2017. Accordingly,
the Ld. AR before us prayed to restore the issue to the file of Ld.CIT(A) for
fresh adjudication as per the provision of Law.
11\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR did not raise any objection if the matter
is restored to the file of Ld. CIT(A) for fresh adjudication as per the
provision of Law.
12\. Both the parties before us relied on the order of authorities below as
favorable to them.
13\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee (supra), the ITAT has restored
the issue for fresh adjudication to the file of the Ld.CIT(A). The relevant
extract of the order is reproduced as under:
> "18. Before us, the ld. Senior Counsel drew our attention to the relevant
> findings of the Tribunal for A.Y. 2008-09 and the relevant findings read as
> under:-
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

> \- 15 -
> 33\. Following our own findings given in A.Y. 2007-08 in ITA No. 2076 &
> 2067/Ahd/2013, we set aside this issue to the file of the ld. CIT(A) (to
> avoid any issue of limitation to give effect to ITAT order as apprehended by
> ld. CR) with a direction that this issue may be decided in accordance with
> Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court of Gujarat and after giving adequate of
> hearing to the assessee . Ground no. 4 is accordingly treated as allowed for
> statistical purpose.
> 19\. Respectfully following the findings of the Co-ordinate Bench (supra),
> we hold accordingly. Ground no. 5 is treated as allowed for statistical
> purpose."
13.1. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore respectfully following the same we restore this
issue to the file of ld. CIT-A for fresh adjudication as per the provision of
law.
13.2 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the ld.
Counsel for the assessee.
13.3 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.) wherein it was held as under: "No Tribunal of fact has any right or
jurisdiction to come to a conclusion entirely contrary to the one reached by
another Bench of the same Tribunal on the same facts. It may be that the
members who constituted the Tribunal and decided on the earlier occasion were
different from the members who decided the case on the present occasion. But
what is relevant is not the personality of the officers presiding over the
Tribunal or participating in the hearing but the Tribunal as an institution.
If it is to be conceded that simply because of the change in the personnel of
the officers who manned the Tribunal, it is open to the new officers to come
to a conclusion totally contradictory to the conclusion which had been reached
by the earlier officers manning the same Tribunal on the same set of facts, it
will not only shake the confidence of the public in judicial procedure as ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 16 -
such, but it will also totally destroy such confidence. The result of this
will be conclusions based on arbitrariness and whims and fancies of the
individuals presiding over the Courts or the Tribunals and not reached
objectively on the basis of the facts placed before the authorities.
If a Bench of a Tribunal on the identical facts is allowed to come to a
conclusion directly opposed to the conclusion reached by another Bench of the
Tribunal on an earlier occasion, that will be destructive of the institutional
integrity itself. That is the reason why in a High Court, if a single Judge
takes a view different from the one taken by another Judge on a question of
law, he does not finally pronounce his view and the matter is referred to a
Division Bench. Similarly if a Division Bench differs from the view taken by
another Division Bench it does not express disagreement and pronounce its
different views, but has the matter posted before a Fuller Bench for
considering the question. If that is the position even with regard to a
question of law, the position will be a fortiori with regard to a question of
fact. If the Tribunal wants to take an opinion different from the one taken by
an earlier Bench, it should place the matter before the President of the
Tribunal, so that he could have the case referred to a Full Bench of the
Tribunal consisting of three or more members for which there is provision in
the IT Act itself."
13.4 In the light of the ratio decidendi above we are of the considered
opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed above
shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength.The ld. DR and the ld.
AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical facts or
circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier order of
the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune with the
judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee
and the Revenue are allowed for statistical purposes.
15\. The third issue raised by the assessee is that ld. CIT (A) erred in
confirming and enhancing the addition made by the AO to Rs. 3,61,21,85,376/-
on account of transfer pricing adjustments.

15.1 The assessee in the year under consideration has made sales of its
medicine namely Pantoprazole to its AE namely Sun Pharma FZE amounting to Rs.
42.43 crores. The assessee to benchmark this transaction and to justify ALP
has submitted certain details as enumerated below:
       i.     The product's technology is owned by the AE.
       ii.    The AE wanted to sell the products in the regulated market of
              the USA and Europe etc.
iii. The AE approached the assessee to develop the medicine in the capacity as
contract research & manufacturing services (for short CRAMS) on its behalf on
the agreed consideration. iv. The assessee treated itself as a tested party as
a contract manufacturer and worked out its margins at 35.43%. v. The assessee
has compared its margin with an independent entity namely Eliy Lily to which
it sold the same drug as contract manufacturer and earned margin at the rate
of 14.43%. vi. The assessee also claimed that it cannot enjoy a high profit
margin on the manufacturing of drug for its AE as it is acting in the capacity
of a manufacturing contractor.
vii. The assessee also submitted that the drug falls under Chapter IV of
federal food, drug, and Cosmetic Act, (in short FD&C Act) which is subject to
legal risk which is to be borne by the AE. As such the assessee is not subject
to such legal risk as it is acting merely as a contract manufacturer. The
assessee further ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT
Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 18 -
submitted that its AE had suffered a huge loss on account of patent
infringement.
15.2 However, the TPO during the proceedings observed certain facts as
enumerated below:
> i. The drug, Pantoprazole falls under chapter IV of the FD&C Act, in the
> preceding year. But in the year under consideration, it was sold as a
> generic drug. Therefore there was no risk to the AE in the year under
> consideration on account of the infringement of the patent.
> ii. The assessee has earned a margin at the rate of 13.86% on the sale to AE
> as per the accounts of the AE whereas the AE has earned profit margin at the
> rate of 87.45% on sale which is representing 4186% on the cost of the drug.
> As per the TPO, such a huge margin is not natural considering the FAR
> analysis. The TPO was of the view that such huge margin has been shifted to
> its AE as it is located in tax heaven zone.
> iii. The AE has sold this drug in the US market through the company namely
> CARACO which is the AE of the assessee. There was the agreement between the
> assessee and the CARACO dated 29th January 2008 for the distribution of the
> drug in the USA. In such agreement there was no reference ITA Nos.922 &

> \- 19 -
> of the AE (FZE)/(BVI) of the assessee though the assessee claimed that the
> technology for Pantoprazole is with the AE (FZE)/(BVI). The TPO also noted
> that the litigation risk was to be borne by the assessee which is also
> supported with the annual report filed by the CARACO with US Securities and
> Exchange Commission (for short SEC). In the sale bills raised by the
> assessee to the sun global BVI/(FZE), the name of Caraco was appearing as
> consignee which suggests that the AE has not performed even the marketing
> function.
> iv. The normal legal risk was born by the associated enterprises namely sun
> FZE/BVI. As such the assessee and the sun global (FZE)/(BVI) were bearing
> together the market/litigation risk. However, the ultimate risk was of the
> assessee in the light of the distribution and marketing agreement with the
> Caraco.
> v. The assessee has contributed entirely towards the functions and the
> assets.
> vi. The risk carried by the associated enterprises has already been factored
> in the sale of the drug by the assessee to the AE.
15.3 In view of the above, the TPO proposed by issuing show cause notice to
apply the profit-sharing method in the ratio of 50% each after ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 20 -
considering the function, assets and the risk involved between the assessee
and its AE.
15.4 In compliance to the show cause notice issued by the TPO, the assessee
vide letter dated 9 December 2013 submitted that it has carried out the
manufacturing activity as per the specifications provided by its AE. The
assessee in support of its claim filed the copy of the agreement with SUN BVI.
It has employed the assets, i.e. US FDA Compliant factory in doing the job
work on behalf of its AE. It did not bear any risk while carrying out
manufacturing activity on behalf of its AE.
15.5 On the other hand, its AE was performing the function to coordinate with
the assessee for getting its product manufactured and supplying the same to
the buyers.
15.6 The AE has employed its assets, i.e. ANDA license manufacture the
products.
15.7 The AE was carrying significant risk for getting the product manufactured
at the premises of the assessee. These risks can be categorized as under:
"Risks borne:-
· Since the owner of the IPRs is the SPG FZE, the substantial risks related to
the product are borne by the SPG FZE · The risks borne by the SPG FZE are as
follows:
> ü Litigation risks and cost ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
> Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
> Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 21 -
> ü Penalties ü Chargebacks ü Shelf Stock Adjustments ü Product Returns and
> Other Allowances ü Infringement issues ü Loss of profit claims by the
> original patent holder in the event the patent claim is rejected.
> In the present case since the product is para IV product the same is
> subjected to huge litigations. The expenses/damage that can arise out of the
> litigations are as follows:-
· Lost profits due to diminished sales because of infringement of patents ·
Lost profits due to the necessity of having to reduce price to compete with
the infringing party · Lost profits due to overall reduction in business
attributable to the need to divert resources because of infringement · Lost
future profits due to depressed prices that cannot now again be raised. ·
Projected Lost profits for future competition with infringer because infringer
established a market position."
15.8 The assessee further submitted that its AE on account of such risk had
incurred a loss of Rs. 506 million USD which has been allocated over a period
of 3 years as detailed under:
> "Without prejudice to the above even if the profit split method is sought to
> be applied, then in the calculation of the profitability the deduction of
> the payment made on account of infringement claim of USD 505 Million ought
> to be allowed. As per the following table it is evident that the entire

15.9 In view of the above, the assessee submitted that the AE being the owner
of IPR is a very complex entity whereas the assessee being a mere contract
manufacturer is a less complex entity. Therefore the assessee should be
treated as the test party.
15.10The assessee further submitted that the entire profit of its associated
enterprises Sun BVI has been wiped off due to the loss on account of
infringement of the patent which is resulting in nil profit to it. Therefore
there cannot be any reason to apply the profit split method to share the
profit of the AE with the assessee.
15.11 Regarding the agreement with the Caraco dated 29th of January 2008, the
assessee submitted that it was made on behalf of its associated companies and
there was a necessary disclosure made by the Caraco in its annual report for
carrying out the transactions with the assessee and its associated enterprise
sun BVI/FZE.
15.12 However, the TPO disagreed with the contention of the assessee by
observing as under:
i. The assessee is not acting as a mere contract manufacturer as claimed by
it. The Sun BVI/FZE while making an application for the registration of the
technology under ANDA has to ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 23 -
furnish the details of the factories where such technology was developed. As
the assessee has sufficient infrastructure facilities which have been approved
by the US FDA, therefore it is implied that there was an active role of the
assessee in getting the product approved from ANDA.
ii. The agreement between the assessee and Caraco dated 29th of January 2008
further evidence that there was the active role of the assessee in the
distribution and sale of the product.
iii. The loss incurred by the AE-Sun BVI/FZE on account of infringement of a
patent is routine business activities. The Sun BVI/FZE may incur a loss in
some of the drugs which will certainly be compensated with the profit of other
drugs.
iv. The assessee is also performing other functions as detailed under:
"-as a person developing the ANDA documentation-as a manufactuerer creating
the entire infrastructure as per theUSFDA standards for production of the drug
(creation of USDFDA approved facility- as a manufacturer getting the facility
approved by USFDA- as a person whose selling and marketing network was
utilized,- as a distributor who handled dispatch of the goods to US (although
the bills were in the name of Sun Global, the dispatch was to Caraco Pharma
Inc, USA)- SPIL which has entered into the agreement with Caraco for
distribution of the product and had assumed the entire risk (in spite of the
fact that risk indeed has been shared by Sun Global),- as a person engaged in
finer nuances of sales and marketing, literature and documentation (Sun Global
BVI does not have sufficient infrastructure of this nature)- SPIL as an
ultimate risk holder (as evident from the sale and distribution agreement with
Caraco filed with US SEC)- it is clear that SPIL cannot be termed as mere
contract manufacturer eligible ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and
ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals

\- 24 -
for a mere 0.75% profits while rest of the 99.25% profits are given to Sun
Global BVI with reference to the total sale value. The decision arrived at in
the preceding year, being on the same issue, is to be followed in the current
year. In its reply to the SCN, the assessee has not elaborated on this issue
nor offered any further justification."
15.13 In view of the above, the TPO modified the FAR analysis of the assessee
as well as its associated enterprise as detailed on pages 66 to 68 of its
order.
15.14 Accordingly, the TPO applied the residual profit split method in respect
of pantoprazole drug to determine the profit of the assessee and its
associated enterprise. The relevant extract of the order of the TPO is
extracted below:
> "8.10 Since it was found fit to use residual profit split method, the global
> profits on account of the transaction was required to be computed. The
> assessee was directed to separately produce the details of sale made by SPIL

8.11. It is seen that SPG FZE has earned huge profits in sale of this drug.
However, the of the assessee company with respect to significant risks
involved in such sales is evident in the costs incurred by SPG FZE on sales
return, rebates and litigationcosts. The assessee has claimed that due to the
'sale of pantoprazole' related costs, Sun BVI has suffered losses in the
preceding years. It has claimed that during the current year, an amount of US$
506 million has been paid to the patent owners for patent infringement in
respect of sales made in the assessment years 08-09, 09-10 and 10-
11\. The claim of the assessee is that the entire profits generated out of the
sale of this product has been wiped out on account of this payment. Since the
infringement amount has been on account of pantoprazole sale which spans three
years, the assessee has bifurcated the payment over three years on the basis
of sales made in these years. The claim made is that if profits of the company
are to be shared, the losses also should be shared by SPIL. The contention of
the assessee company is closely examined. Sun BVI is being paid dominantly for
the risk being carried by it and to some extent marketing functions being
performed. The main risk carried by it relates to the goods return, rebates,
litigation costs and damage costs in suits filed by the patent holders. Since
Sun BVI has already been compensated for the risks being carried by its @ 50%
of the profits on sale of this drug, no further compensation is found
necessary with respect to its legal expenses. It is clarified that the
additional expenditure on litigation incurred by the company will not be
available for set off as it is precisely for this reason that the AE has been
allowed 50% share in profits.

8.12 However, in earlier discussions, it has been held by the undersigned that
while majority of the risk is being undertaken by SPG FZE, and most of the
other functions/assets are being performed/contributed by SPIL resulting in a
profit split of 50:50, some portion of risk is also being taken up by SPIL as
evident from thedistribution agreement. Sun Global is remunerated only for its
risk and hence it is liable to suffer major portion of the risk. As admitted
by the assessee company and also evident from sale of other para IV drugs, Sun
Global gets high margins in such drugs while some drugs may lead to litigation
and subsequent infringement costs. Higher margins of other drugs would meet
such eventualities which are duly factored in pricing the products in order to
obviate such risks. As mentioned above, since Sun Global exists to take major
portion of the risk while only some portion of the risk is to be adopted by
SPIL, it would not be necessary for SPIL to bear any residual burden in
respect ofinfringement payout of a particular product although it carries all
the responsibilities as an ultimate parent. It would be sufficient if it is
attributed a limited risk in addition to its major functions/assets to justify
the profit split of 50:50. In light of the above discussion,it is found
reasonable to attribute 80% of the risk to Sun Global and 20% risk toSPIL.
Thetotal infringement payout is apportioned for the present year in ratio of
turnover and 20% of such apportionment amounting to Rs 142,52,16,938/- is
allowed as deductionfrom the amount of Rs 225,76,15,860/- suggested as
adjustment in the case ofpantoprazole sale.
8.13 In light of the above discussion, an upward adjustment of Rs
83,23,98,920/- is made to the profits of the assessee company with reference
to benchmarking of the transaction of sale of pantoprazole to SPG BVI and SPG
FZE."
16\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who has the
enhanced the addition made by the AO/TPO by observing as under:

80\. Adverting to the allegations of Ld Shri Shrivastava that these
arrangements by the assessee is a brutal form of tax evasion , the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V. vs. Union of
India and Another reported in 341 ITR 1 has laid down the ratio :
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -

"It is the task of the court to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction
and while doing so it has to look at the entire transaction as a whole and not
adopt a dissecting approach. All tax planning is not illegal or illegitimate
or impermissible".
81.The Hon'ble Supreme Court further held. :-
(iv)The Income-tax Act, 1961, in the matter of corporate taxation, is founded
on the principle of the independence of companies as economic entities with
legal independence vis-a-vis their shareholders or participants. Consequently,
the entities subject to income-tax are taxed on profits derived by them on
stand-alone basis, irrespective of their actual degree of economic
independence and regardless of whether profits are reserved or distributed to
the shareholders or participants. Furthermore, shareholders or participants,
that are subject to (personal or corporate) income-tax, are generally taxed on
profits derived in consideration of their shareholding or participations, such
as capital gains. It is fairly well settled that for tax treaty purposes a
subsidiary and its parent are also totally separate and distinct taxpayers.
The fact that a parent company exercises a shareholder's influence on its
subsidiaries does not generally imply that the subsidiaries are to be deemed
residents of the State in which the parent company resides. Where the
subsidiary's executive directors' competences are transferred to other persons
or bodies or where the subsidiary's executive directors' decision-making has
become fully subordinate to the holding company with the consequence that the
subsidiary's executive directors are no more than puppets then the turning
point in respect of the subsidiary's place of residence comes about. Whether a
transaction is used principally as a colourable device for the distribution of
earnings, profits and gains, is determined by a review of all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the transaction.
(v) Holding structures are recognized in corporate as well as tax laws.
Special purpose vehicles and holding companies have a place in legal
structures in India, be it in company law, the takeover code under the
Securities and Exchange Board of India or even under the income-tax law. When
it comes to taxation of a holding structure, at the threshold, the burden is
on the Revenue to allege and establish abuse, in the sense of tax avoidance in
the creation and/or use of such structures. In the application of a judicial
anti-avoidance rule, the Revenue may invoke the "substance over form"
principle or "piercing the corporate veil" test only after it is able to
establish on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the
transaction that the transaction in question is a sham or tax avoidant.
(vi) The legal position of any company incorporated abroad is that its powers,
functions and responsibilities are governed by the law of its incorporation.
Though it may be advantageous for parent and subsidiary companies to work as a
group, each subsidiary will look to see whether there are separate commercial
interests which should be guarded. Whether the parent company has "power" over
the subsidiary depends on the facts of each case. In the case of
multinationals their subsidiaries have a great deal of autonomy in the country
concerned except where subsidiaries are created or used as a sham. The
directors of the subsidiary under their articles ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017
(By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 33 -
are the managers of the companies. They are not to be dictated by the parent
company if it is not in the interests of those companies (subsidiaries). The
fact that the parent company exercises shareholder's influence on its
subsidiaries cannot obliterate the decision-making power or authority of its
(subsidiary's) directors. The decisive criteria is whether the parent
company's management has such steering interference with the subsidiary's core
activities that the subsidiary can no longer be regarded to perform those
activities on the authority of its own executive directors.(vii) A typical
large business corporation consists of sub-incorporates. Such division is
legal and recognized by company law, laws of taxation, takeover codes. The
parent is the only group member that normally discloses financial results.
Below the parent company are the subsidiaries which hold operational assets of
the business and which often have their own subordinate entities that can
extend layers. Subsidiaries are often created for tax or regulatory reasons.
They at times come into existence from mergers and acquisitions. As group
member, subsidiaries are financially interlinked. Such grouping is based on
the principle of internal correlation.
82\. A thought full consideration of the aforementioned decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court would show that even the Apex court have recognized that
multinationals and multi entities group companies constitute subsidiaries in
furtherance to their objects and to carry on their business smoothly in a
competitive world. Moreover no person would arrange its affairs in such a
manner which would culminate into huge losses to the extent of USD 506
millions as was suffered by the assessee group in this transaction.
83\. Having established that the ownership of IPR/ANDA rights of Pantoprazole
Sodium was with SPG BVI, now let us examine the applicability of the most
appropriate method for determining the arm's length price.
84\. OFCD guidelines for profits spilt method (PSM) states as under:- C.
Transactional profit split method C.1 In general 2.108 The transactional
profit split method seeks to eliminate the effect on profits of special
conditions made or imposed in a controlled transaction (or in controlled
transactions that are appropriate to aggregate under the principles of
paragraphs 3.9-3.12) by determining the division of profits that independent
enterprises would have expected to realise from engaging in the transaction or
transactions. The transactional profit split method first identifies the
profits to be split for the associated enterprises from the controlled
transactions in which the associated enterprises are engaged (the "combined
profits"). References to "profits" should be taken as applying equally to
losses. See paragraphs 2.124- 2.131 for a discussion of how to measure the
profits to be split. It then splits those combined profits between the
associated enterprises on an economically valid basis that approximates the
division of profits that would have been anticipated and reflected in an
agreement made at arm's length. See paragraphs 2.132 -2.145 for a
discussion/6f how to split the combined profits.

Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 34 -
C.2 Strengths and weaknesses 2.109 The main strength of the transactional
profit split method is that it can offer a solution for highly integrated
operations for which a one-sided method would not be appropriate. For example,
see the discussion of the appropriateness and application of profit split
methods to the global trading of financial instruments between associated
enterprises in Part III, Section C of the Report on the Attribution of Profits
to Permanent Establishments.2 A transactional profit split method may also be
found to be the most appropriate method in cases where both parties to a
transaction make unique and valuable contributions (e.g.contribute unique
intangibles) to the transaction, because in such a case independent parties
might wish to share the profits of the transaction in proportion to their
respective contributions and a two-sided method might be more appropriate in
these circumstances than a one-sided method. In addition, in the presence of
unique and valuable contributions, reliable comparables information might be
insufficient to apply another method. On the other hand, a transactional
profit split method would ordinarily not be used in cases where one party to
the transaction performs only simple functions and does not make any
significant unique contribution (e.g. contract manufacturing or contract
service activities in relevant circumstances), as in such cases a
transactional profit split method typically would not be appropriate In view
of the functional analysis of that party. See paragraphs 3.38-3.39 for a
discussion of limitations in available comparables.
85\. United Nations practical manual on transfer pricing states as under:-
6.3.13. Profit Split Method 6.3.13.1. The Profit Split Method is typically
applied when both sides of the controlled transaction contribute significant
intangible property. The profit is to be divided such as is expected in a
joint venture relationship.
6.3.13.2. The Profit Split Method seeks to eliminate the effect on profits of
special conditions made or imposed in a controlled transaction (or in
controlled transactions that it is appropriate to aggregate) by determining
the division of profits that independent enterprises would have expected to
realize from engaging in the transaction or transactions.
86\. A perusal of the aforementioned guidelines shows that PSM can offer a
solution for highly integrated operations for which a one sided method would
not be appropriate. PSM may also found to be the most appropriate method in
cases where both parties to a transaction make unique and valuable
contributions to the transaction. Considering the functions performed by the
appellant company to SPG BVI, it is clear that SPIL has performed only one
simple function and that is manufacturing of Pantoprazole Tablets. Except for
this, there is no significant unique contribution by SPIL. For such simple
functions as per OECD guidelines for transaction profit spilt method typically
would not be appropriate of the functional analysis of that party.

87\. The relevant agreement which is placed on record and has been dealt
elsewhere clearly establishes that the appellant company SPIL is nothing but a
contract manufacturer of SPG BVI. Now let us examine the relevant provisions
of the Act read with Rules.
Determination of arm's length price under section 92C.
10B. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's length
price in relation to an international transaction --[or a specified domestic
transaction] shall be determined by any of the following methods, being the
most appropriate method, in the following manner, namely:-
d) profit split method, which may be applicable mainly in international
transactions --[or specified domestic transactions]involving transfer or
unique intangibles or in multiple international transactions [or specified
domestictransactions] which are so interrelated that they cannot be evaluated
separately for the purpose of determining the arm's length price of any one
transaction, by which-
i) the combined net profit of the associated enterprises arising from the
international transaction --[or the specified domestic transaction] in which
they are engaged, is determined;
(ii) the relative contribution made by each of the associated enterprises to
the earning of such combined net profit, is then evaluated on the basis of the
functions performed, assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by
each enterprise and on the basis of reliable external market data which
indicate how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprises
performingcomparable functions in similar circumstances;
(iii) the combined net profit is then split amongst the enterprises in
proportion to their relative contributions, as evaluated under sub-clause
(ii);
(iv) the profit thus apportioned to the assessee is taken into account to
arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction
[or the specified domestic transaction] :
Provided that the combined net profit referred to in sub-clause (i) may, in
the first instance, be partially allocated to each enterprise so as to provide
it with a basic return appropriate for the type of international transaction
--[or specified domestic transaction] in which it is engaged, with reference
to market returns achieved for similar types of transactions by independent
enterprises, and thereafter, the residual net profit remaining after such
allocation may be split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their
relative contribution in the manner specified under sub-clauses
(ii) and (iii), and in such a case the aggregate of the net profit allocated
to the enterprise in the first instance together with the residual net profit
apportioned to that enterprise on the basis of its relative contribution shall
be taken to be the net profit arising to that enterprise from the
international transaction --[or the specified domestic transaction];

(e) Transactional net margin method, by which,--
(i) the net profit margin realized by the enterprise from an international
transaction[or a specified domestic transaction] entered into with an
associated enterprise is computed in relation to costs incurred or sales
effected or assets employed or to be employed by the enterprise or having
regard to any other relevant base;
(ii) the net profit margin realized by the enterprise or by an unrelated
enterprise from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such
transactions is computed having regard to the same base;
(iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (ii) arising in
comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the
differences, if any, between the international transaction [or the specified
domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between
the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect
the amount of net profit margin in the open market;
(iv) the net profit margin realized by the enterprise and referred to in sub-
clause(i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to
in sub-clause(iii);
(v) the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to
arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction
[or the specified domestic transaction];
88\. PSM is applicable when the international transaction involved transfer of
unique intangibles (in the case in hand there is no such transfer from SPG BVI
to SPIL), or in multiple international transaction which are so inter related
that they cannot be evaluated separately for the purpose of determining the
arm's length price of any one transaction. This is also absent (in the case in
hand as the appellant company has done only manufacturing of Pantoprazole
Tablets for SPG BVI).
89\. Coming to the application of TNMM, we find that the profit margin
benchmark by the assessee at 21.57% on sales transactions is much higher than
the margin shown by the assessee with Eli Lily.
90\. The revenue authorities have compared the agreements of SPIL with Eli
Lily and SPIL with SPG BVI and have come to the conclusion that a conspectus
reading of the relevant clauses show that the assessee is not a contract
manufacturer in the case of SPG BVI. This finding of the revenue authorities
is not acceptable for the simple reason that they have compared the clauses of
the respective agreements without considering the nature of work done by SPIL.
It may be possible that certain terms and conditions may be absent in the
agreement between the assessee and SPG BVI but that itself would not deny the
assessee, the status of contract manufacturer. In our considered opinion, the
assessee has performed only one function and that is manufacturing
ofPantoprazole Sodium and for this, the demonstrative evidence is exhibited at
pages 569 and 570 of the paper book, and as mentioned elsewhere, clearly
establishes the ownership of ANDA with Sun Pharma Global. For the sake of
completeness, it would not be out of place to mention that the print out of
these documents were taken from the Website on 28.09.2011 and 27.09.2011 and
the order of the First Appellate Authority is 14.10.2014 and yet the FAA has
observed that the assessee did not furnish ANDA related documents filed by
SPG. SPGmay not have done any filing related to Pantoprazole Sodium patent to
US FDA but the fact of the matter and which have been demonstrated
successfully by the appellant ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 37 -
company is that the IPR/ANDA rights became the property of SPG BVI by virtue
of the agreement for sale between SPARC and SPG.
91\. Adverting to assessee's alternate and without prejudice contention that
even if PSM is he ld to be the most appropriate method for a moment than also
the same has to be considered in the light of the sequence of events starting
from the manufacturing and sales of the drug Pantoprazole and ending with the
out ofcourt settlement and the payment of settlement compensation of USD 506
million The settlement is based on the cumulative profits earned by the AE
till the date of settlement. here is no dispute and it has been accepted by
both the lower authorities that after the out of court settlement of the
litigation the assessee group has suffered losses which were based on the
aggregate of profits earned by the group over all the year. With the
settlement based on aggregate of yearly profits then even if the Profit Split
Method is applied than the set off of each year losses has to be given for the
corresponding year. The undisputed compensation being settled on the base of
all yearly profits made by the AE during the exclusivity period PSM cannot be
worked by divorcing the business realities. The contention of revenue that it
is not concerned with the settlement which is pass event is untenable. Even if
the PSM is applied the relatable losses which were so apparent by the time
assessment was framed cannot be given a go by on unsustainable revenue stand.
In such eventuality even the ALP offered by assesse as a contract manufacturer
also will be wiped out. The PSM application may actually result in reduction
of returned ALP working. Thus, considering the issues from all possible
angles, the assessee has, undisputedly and as accepted by revenue, ultimately
suffered losses which are not claimed in its books or tax purposes. Even the
alternative application of PSM fails and would do no good to the Revenue .
92\. To summarize in nutshell , by the order of the Hon'ble High Court
Innovative Research and Development /division of the appellant company was
demerged and given to Sun Pharma Advance Research company (SPARC) subsequently
SPARC transferred ANDA rights to SPG BVI. SPG BVI has been entered into an
agreement with the appellant company SPIL for the manufacturing of
Pantoprazole. Pursuant to this agreement assessee manufactured Pantoprazole
and sold the same to Caraco Ltd on the directions of SPG BVI. On such sale
transaction, the appellant company had shown a net margin of 21.57% bench mark
the same on transactional net margin method which was dismissed by the revenue
authorities questioning firstly, the ANDA rights with SPG BVI and secondly,
comparing the contract manufacturing agreement of SPIL with SPG BVI and SPIL
with ELI Lily. The revenue authorities ultimately applied profit spilt method
and made the upward adjustment.
93\. As demonstrated elsewhere, the IPR/ANDA rights were very much with SPG
BVI who entered into an agreement with the appellant company for the
manufacturing of the said drug. The application of Transactional Net Margin
Method is the most appropriate method in such sale transaction and has been
benchmarked by the assessee by showing it to be higher than the margin earned
from the sales made to Eli Lily.
94\. Considering the facts in totality in the light of the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V.
(supra) and on conspectus understanding of the facts as discussed elsewhere,
we do not find any merit in the findings of the First AppellateAuthorityin
accepting theapplication of PSM as the MAM , in our understanding of the facts
TNMM is the MAM on the ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13

given facts and the same is accepted as such. We set aside the findings of the
ld. CIT(A) and direct to delete the addition of Rs. 612,03,39,468/-. Ground
no. 5 of the assesse is allowed.
27.As mentioned elsewhere, the facts are identical; therefore, we do not find
any reason why the findings of the Tribunal (supra) should not be followed.
Respectfully following the findings, we direct the AO to delete the addition
of Rs. 103,87,52,830/-. Ground no. 6 is accordingly allowed.
21\. Admittedly, the facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of
the case as discussed above. However, the question arises whether the TPO
verified the details furnished by the assessee in determining the ALP of the
impugned transaction using TNMM during the assessment proceedings. Regarding
this, a query was raised from the bench to the learned counsel for the
assessee who replied that all the necessary details were available with the
TPO and no defect of whatsoever was pointed out therein. Similarly, the ITAT
in the earlier year because no defect was pointed out by the TPO in the
details furnished by the assessee in determining the ALP using TNMM allowed
the appeal of the assessee. The learned DR has also not brought anything on
record contrary to the argument advanced by the learned AR of the assessee.
21.1 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the ld.
counsel for the assessee.

& 2012-13
\- 39 -
21.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above said judgment we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR and
the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical
facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier
order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune
with the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, we set aside the
order of the Ld.CIT (A). Accordingly, we direct the AO to delete the addition
made by him. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
22\. The issue raised in ground no. 4 and 5 is related to the addition made on
account of sale of drugs other than pantoprazole to SPG BVI and SPG FZE.
22.1. The issue, in this case, relates to the two types of drugs as detailed
under:
             i.    Drugs under the category of Para VI other than
                   Pantoprazole.
ii. Drugs not falling under the category of Para VI ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 40 -
22.2 The facts of the case are similar to the drug sold by the assessee namely
Pantoprazole which has been elaborately discussed in the preceding paragraph.
The only difference is in the ratio adopted by the TPO in applying the profit
split method for determining the ALP in respect of Drugs not falling under the
category of Para VI. As such the TPO has applied the profit split method in
the ratio of 80:20 in respect such drugs. The assessee share was determined in
the ratio of 80% whereas the share of the AE was determined in the ratio of
20% after considering the FAR analysis.
22.3 However, the AO in applying the profit split method for determining the
ALP in respect of the Drugs under the category of Para VI other than
Pantoprazole adopted the ratio of 50% each between the assessee & its AE as
used in the case of Pantoprazole drug. The TPO determined the said of ration
under profit split method after considering the FAR analysis.
In view of the above, the TPO made an upward adjustment of Rs. 73,03,24,358 in
respect of drug falling under the category of Para-IV other than Pantoprazole
and Rs. 21,34,71,777.00 in respect of drug falling under the category of Non-
Para-IV. Thus the AO made the addition of Rs. 94,37,96,134.00 in aggrgate to
the total income of the assessee.

& 2012-13

23\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who enhanced the
addition in the order of the AO/TPO after having a reliance on the order of
his predecessor for the assessment year 2008-09 by observing as under:
> "8.3.9. On careful consideration of the material available on record, it is

24\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the Assessee is in appeal
before us.
25\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA No. 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned addition was deleted by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated 08-09-2017.
26\. On the other hand the Ld. DR filed the written submissions which are
available on record. But the same has not been reproduced for the sake of
brevity and convenience. The ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
27\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee (supra), the ITAT deleted ITA

28\. Admittedly, the facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of
the case as discussed above. However, the question arises whether the TPO
verified the details furnished by the assessee in determining the ALP of the
impugned transaction using TNMM during the assessment proceedings. Regarding
this, a query was raised from the bench to the learned counsel for the
assessee who replied that all the necessary details were available with the
TPO and no defect of whatsoever was pointed out therein. Similarly, the ITAT
in the earlier year considering the fact that no defect was pointed out by the
TPO in the details furnished by the assessee in determining the ALP using TNMM
allowed the appeal of the assessee. The learned DR has also not brought
anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the learned AR of the
assessee.

28.1 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the ld.
Counsel for the assessee.
28.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above-said judgment, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed

the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical

order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune to
maintain the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, we set aside the
order of the Ld.CIT (A). Accordingly, we direct the AO/TPO to delete the
addition made by him. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.

29\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground no. 6 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in not allowing the weighted deduction under section 35(2AB) of the
Act in respect of certain expenses.
30\. The assessee during the year has incurred total research and development
expenses amounting to Rs. 11,962.75 lacs. But the assessee claimed weighted
deduction under section 35(2AB) of the Act in respect of the expenses
amounting to Rs. 11,271.35 lacs only. As such the assessee omitted to claim
the weighted deduction in respect of the expenses of Rs. 689.37 lacs
inadvertently. Accordingly, the assessee claimed the weighted deduction in
respect of such expenses under section 35(2AB) of the Act during the
assessment proceedings by way of filing a letter dated 7th February 2014.
30.1. However, the AO disregarded the contention of the assessee by observing
that it has not claimed the weighted deduction under section 35(2AB) of the
Act in the books of accounts. Moreover, the assessee should have filed the
revised return of income for claiming the weighted deduction under section
35(2AB) of the Act, but the assessee has not done so. Thus the AO disallowed
the weighted deduction claimed by the assessee.
31\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A).

31.1 The assessee before the Ld.CIT (A) submitted that it has omitted to claim
the weighted deduction under section 35(2AB) of the Act in respect of the
expenses for Rs. 689.37 lacs inadvertently in the return of income. But it is
a fact that the deduction was claimed under section 35(2AB) of the Act at the
rate of a hundred percent. Thus it is not a case where the assessee has not
claimed the deduction in the return of income.
31.2 The assessee further submitted that it can claim deduction during
assessment proceedings in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Gujarat High
Court in the case of Claris life sciences Ltd reported in 326 ITR
251\. 31.3 The assessee also submitted that it is not necessary to get the
research and development expenses approved by the DSIR.
31.4 However, Ld.CIT (A) rejected the claim of the assessee by observing that
the weighted deduction was not claimed in the income tax return and no revised
return was filed for the claim of such weighted deduction.
31.5 The Ld.CIT (A) also observed that the argument of the assessee is not
relevant to the effect that it is not necessary to get the expenses certified
by the DSIR to claim the weighted deduction as the plea of the assessee was
rejected on the preliminary ground i.e. the weighted deduction was not claimed
in the income tax return.

& 2012-13
\- 47 -
31.6 In view of the above the ld. CIT-A rejected the claim of the assessee and
confirmed the order of the AO.
32\. Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.CIT (A), both the assessee and
Revenue are in appeal before us. The assessee is in appeal before us against
the confirmation of the disallowance of weighted deduction whereas the Revenue
is in appeal before us on the ground that the DSIR did not certify the
impugned expenses.
32.1 The ground of appeal no. 10 raised by the Revenue stands as under:
"10. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, learned CIT(A) erred
in law and facts in directing to allow weighted deduction on the R&D expenses
which was not certified by DSIR without appreciating that as per provisions of
section 35(2AB), the assessee is eligible to for weighted deduction only in
respect of the amount which is certified by the prescribe authority i.e.
Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial research, government of
India."
32.2 The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances this ITAT in the own case of the assessee in ITA No.
1666/AHD/2016 vide order dated 08-09-2017 has allowed the deduction under
section 35(2AB) of the Act.
33\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 48 -
34\. Both the parties relied on the order of the authorities below as
favorable to them.
35\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on records. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee's (supra), the ITAT allowed the
deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the Act. The relevant extract of the order is
reproduced as under:
> "41.After giving a thoughtful consideration, we find force in the contention

Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Now coming to the Revenue ground of appeal as discussed above.
37\. The grievance of the Revenue in this ground of appeal is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in directing the AO to allow the weighted deduction under section
35(2)AB of the Act in respect of the expenses which were not certified by
DSIR.
37.1 Regarding this we note that the identical issue was also there in the own
case of the assessee in ITA No. 1390/AHD/2016 pertaining to the AY 2009-10
which was decided vide order dated 22-12-2016 as held under:
"6. We have heard both the parties. Case file perused. There does not appear
to be any dispute that the assessee is admittedly an entity running the
specified in house research and development facilities. The prescribed
authority in the instant case is the "DSIR" i.e. Department of Scientific &
Industrial Research, Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of India.
This prescribed authority has undisputedly issued "Order of approval of in
house Research & Development Facility u/s.35(2AB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961"
in Form 3CM on 11.06.2009 as pertaining to the previous year relevant to the
impugned assessment year. It further contains a list of assessee's various in
house research & development facilities. Ld. PCIT's case as made out in his
above extracted findings is that the assessee has failed to produce Form 3CL
with respect to approval of its impugned revenue and capital expenses. His
view is that the Assessing Officer ought not to have accepted assessee's
weighted deduction in absence of the above approval Form 3CL.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 50 -
7\. We have given our thoughtful consideration to rival contentions as well as
ld. PCIT's concern expressed in order revising the above regular assessment.
We deem its appropriate at this stage to throw some light on the nature and
ambit of Form 3CL. The same comes under Rule 6(7A) of the Income Tax Rules,
1962 framed under the provisions of the Act. The above sub rule is relevant
for approval of expenditure incurred on in house research & development
facility by a company u/s.35(2AB). Sub clause (b) thereof is the specific
provision thereto stipulating that the prescribed authority shall submit its
report in relation to the approval of in house Research & Development facility
in Form No.3CL to the Director General (Income Tax Exemptions) within 60 days
of its granting approval. The same is merely in the form of intimation to be
sent from prescribed authority's end to the department. An assessee engaged in
such Research & Development activity having already obtained Form 3CM approval
of its facility has no role to play in such correspondence. We notice that a
co-ordinate bench of this tribunal in ACIT vs. M/s. Torrent Pharmaceuticals
ITA No.3569/Ahd/2004 decided on 13.11.2009 holds that the impugned weighted
deduction is not to be restricted to the extent of the amount of the necessary
expenditure incurred stated in such Form 3CL. We further find that hon'ble
jurisdictional high court's decision in CIT vs. CLARIS LIFESCIENCES Ltd.
(2010) 326 ITR 251 (Gujarat) upholds this tribunal's decision in the very
assessee's case observing that expenses incurred before Form 3CM approval
cannot be denied for the purpose of Section 35(2AB) weighted deduction. We
follow the very reasoning to opine that facts of the instant case rather go a
step further wherein the appellant has only claimed those expenses which
relate to the time period as approved in the Form 3CM. We accordingly hold
that the assessee is very much entitled for claiming the above capital and
revenue expenses incurred on in house research and development amounting to
Rs.237,77,05,310/-. The Assessing Officer had rightly held it entitled for the
above weighted deduction after verifying all necessary particulars during the
course of scrutiny."
37.2 We further note that the above order of the ITAT was also affirmed by the
Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the assessee's case in tax appeal no. 541 of
2017 dated 14-8-2017 wherein it was held as under:
"5. Having heard Ld. Counsel for the parties and having perused the orders on
record, we are broadly in agreement with the view of the Tribunal.
Undisputedly, the research and development facility set up by the assessee was
approved by the prescribed authority and necessary approval was granted in the
prescribed format. The communication in Form 3CM was thereafter, between the
prescribed authority and the department. If the same was not so, surely, the
assessee cannot be made to suffer. To this extent, the Tribunal was perfectly
correct and the Commissioner was not, in observing that in absence of such
certification, claim of deduction under section 35(2AB) was not allowable.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 51 -
However, neither the prescribed authority nor the Assessing Officer has
applied the mind as to the expenditure, be it revenue or or capital in nature,
actually incurred in developing the in-house research and development
facility. To the limited extent, the Commissioner desired the Assessing
Officer to verify such figures, we would allow the Assessing Officer to do so.
In other words, in principle, we accept the Tribunal's reasons and
conclusions. Merely because the prescribed authority failed to send intimation
in Form 3CL, would not be reason enough to deprive the assessee's claim of
deduction under section 35(2AB) of the Act. However, in facts of the present
case, it would be open for the Assessing Officer to verify the actual
expenditure incurred by the assessee."
37.3 Thus respectfully, following the same, we do not find any reason to
interfere in the order of the Ld. CIT-A. Hence the ground of appeal of the
Revenue is dismissed.
38\. Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the Ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the Ld.
Counsel for the assessee and the finding of the Ld. CIT-A.
38.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above-said judgment, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR and
the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical
facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 52 -
order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune
with the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, we allow the ground
of appeal of the assessee and dismiss the ground of appeal of the Revenue.
39\. The issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 7 is that the Ld.CIT (A)
erred in confirming the order of the AO by allocating the research and
development expenses incurred by it to the other partnership firms and
accordingly made the disallowance of such expenses proportionately.
40\. The assessee is a partner in two partnership firms namely Sun Pharma
Industries and Sun Pharma Sikkim (for short SPI and SPS). Both the partnership
firms were engaged in manufacturing the drugs. However, the assessee was
carrying out research and development expenses for the drugs manufactured by
both the firms. Accordingly, the assessee claimed the deduction for all the
research and development expenses incurred by it in its books of accounts.
41\. The AO during the assessment proceeding observed that both the
partnership firm are claiming deduction under section 80IC of the Act. As such
both the partnership firms were showing a huge amount of profit which was
allocated to the partners of the firm. The assessee being a major shareholder
in the firms received a huge amount as a share of profit which was claimed as
exempted under section 10(2A) of the Act.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 53 -
Accordingly, the AO was of the view that the research and development expenses
incurred by the assessee on the drugs manufactured by the partnership firms
should be allocated to these partnership firms. Thus the AO worked out the
research and development expenses pertaining to the firms for Rs.
58,07,48,088/- on the basis of the turnover of the formulations and disallowed
the same by adding to the total income of the assessee.
42\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld. CIT (A) who partly
confirmed the order of the AO after having a reliance on the order of his
predecessor for the assessment year 2008-09 by observing as under:
> "12,1. Similar disallowance was made in A.Y. 2008-09 after reopening the
> proceedings u/s. 147. The order u/s. 143(3) r.w.s. 147 for A.Y. 2008-09 was

7.3.1 These claims of the appellant are to be examined in view of the
different provisions of the IT Act 1961\. The share of profit received by the
appellant from the firm is exempt from the Income Tax. The remuneration is
received from the firm is taxable under the head income from business and
profession, as per the provision of clause (v) of section 23 of the IT Act
1961. But the proviso to this section says that where such remuneration or
part thereof has not been allowed to be deducted under clause (b) of section
40, the income under this clause shall be adjusted to the extent of the amount
not so allowed to be deducted. Now as per the provisions of section 40(b)(i),
any payment of salary, bonus, commission or remuneration to any partner who is
not a working partner is not allowed as a deduction in computation of the
total income of the firm. The explanation 4 to clause (b) says that working
partner means an individual who is actively engaged in conducting the
business.or provision of the firm of which he is a partner. Hence, the
appellant being a company cannot be a working partner of a firm for the
purposes of provisions of Income Tax Act 1961\. Accordingly, any remuneration
paid to the appellant is not allowable as a deduction in the computation of
the total income of the firm and at the same time such remuneration will not
form part of total income of the appellant. Thus, both the share of profit and
remuneration received by the appellant from the firm will not form part of its
total income and accordingly any expenditure incurred by the appellant for
earning such share of profit or remuneration cannot be allowed as a deduction
in computation of its total income. Hence it is held that the AO has rightly
disallowed the R & D expenditure incurred by the appellant, the results of
which have been given by the appellant to the firm SPI in the capacity of its
partner for manufacturing drugs by this firm. Hence this contention of the
appellant is rejected. Y .
7.4 The other contention of the appellant is that as per section 35, R & D
expenditure has been incurred by it for its own business and hence same cannot
be debited in the books of accounts of SPI. But as already stated, once it is
proved that part of such expenditure has been incurred by the appellant for
the purpose of earning of share of profit and remuneration from the firm which
is not forming part of its own total income, such expenses cannot be allowed
as a deduction in computation -of its total income. The AO has disallowed such
expenditure only and it is not a case where such expenses have been directed
to be debited in the books of accounts of the firm, SPI. Hence, this
contention is nlso rejected.
7.5 The other contentions of the appellant are related to the method adopted
by the AO for the purposes of allocation of such R & D expenses to the
manufacturing activitiesundertaken by the appellant and the manufacturing
activity undertaken by the firm SPI. In this regard, the appellant has
submitted that it had submitted working on unit profitability statement before
AO during the course of assessment proceedings vide letter dated 21/11/2011
whereby the bifurcation .of turnover between domestic/export and
formulation/bulk is clearly evident. These workings have been submitted by the
appellant during the course of the current appellate proceedings also and the
same are being utilized for the purpose of deciding this issue.

Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 55 -
7.5.1 The first contention of the appellant is that the partnership firm and
the appellant company cater to the different sections of business with
underline facts. These differences have been submitted by the appellant which
have already been reproduced above. The first difference pointed out is that
the partnership firm is only into production of formulation drugs for the
domestic market, whereas appellant incurred R & D expenditure on bulk drug
segment and formulation segment both and that too for domestic market as well
as international market and regulated market. It has been submitted that the
partnership firm has sold its product in domestic market only. In this regard,
the appellant has also submitted the copy of Financial statement for FY
2007-08 of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. As per this, the turnover of this
firm is 1086.2 crore, which is the same figure as adopted by the Ad in his
order. Besides in Clause '8' of the Notes on Financial Statement, it has been
mentioned that the firm operates in one reportable geographical segment i.e.
"within India". On the basis of details furnished by the appellant it is seen
that the firm is not into bulk drug formulations. Hence, R & D expenditure
related to bulk formulation are not to be allocated towards the expenditure
for the firm SPI and the AO has also accepted this contention. But the AO has
allocated entire R & D expenditure for formulation drugs in the ratio of total
turnover of the appellant and of the firm M/s. SPI. The appellant's claim that
R & D expenditure Incurred for export formulations should not be allocated to
SPI is found to be correct as SPI has not exported any drug during the FY
2007-08. But at the same time if this method is adopted, then the export
turnover of the appellant will have to be reduced from its total turnover for
the purposes of computing the allocation of expenses on R & D for formulation
drugs. Besides, the appellant's claim is that only an amount of 1651.48 lakhs
have been incurred pertaining to domestic formulation business. From the
details submitted by the appellant before the AO it is seen that the expenses
incurred under different Heads are as follows:-

                                                                               Domestic market.

    expenditure
    Grand Total R & D Expenditure                                  13104.19
Thus, the total expenses for formulation drug for domestic market is 1651.48,+
2193.40 + 167.61 +.62.90 = 4075.49 lakhs.
The balance expenditure of 9028.7 lakhs is for the purpose of overseas market.
The appellant's claim that only 1651.48 lakhs of expenditure should be
considered for allocation to SPI is not acceptable due to lack of proper
details filed by it before the AO or during the current appellate proceedings.
The Domestic formulations turnover of SPIL is Rs. 1451.25 crores andthat of
SPI is Rs.1086.2 crores. Hence, the R & D expenditure related to formulation
drug fordomestic purposes is to be allocated in the ratio of these two
turnovers. Hence, ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT
Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13

the R & D expenditure related to the formulationproduction made by the SPI
comes to 1086.2/2537.45x 4075.49 =Rs.1744.56 lakhs.
7.5.2 Accordingly, the AO is directed to restrict the disallowance out of -
R&D expenses to this figure of Rs.1744.56 lakhs. The appellant gets part
relief accordingly."

    Grand Total R & D Expenditure                            j 12776.45
Since the facts are identical in this year a/so, I respectful/y following the
order of my predecessor in appellant's own case as mentioned above, hold that
the R&D expenses incurred by the appellant admittedly are also pertaining to
SPI/SPS and hence the same are required to be allocated in the ratio of
turnover of appellant and SPI/SPS. I also agree with the views of my
predecessor that the expenses incurred for Development of Formulation Drugs
for domestic market are to be considered only because SPI/SPS has no business
outside the country. As per the details furnished the R&D expenses for
Development of Formulation drugs for domestic market are Rs.3201.08 + 2816.97
+ -194.80+ 130.68 = Rs,6343.53 lacs. Accordingly, the Assessing Officer is
directed to work outthe disallowance of R&D expenses out of Rs. 6343.53 lacs
in the ratio of domestic turnover of SPI/SPS and SPIL i.e. appellant, after
necessary verification of the figures. Thus, appellant succeeds partly in
respect of Ground No. 9."
43\. Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.CIT (A), both the assessee and the
Revenue are in appeal before us. The assessee is in the appeal for the
allocation of R&D expenses to SPI and SPS whereas the Revenue is in appeal
against the direction of Ld.CIT (A) to allocate the expenses excluding export
turnover.
44\. The Revenue has raised ground no 6 reproduced as under:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -

> \- 59 -
"2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, learned CIT(A) erred in
law and facts in restricting the disallowance of R&D expenses after excluding
the export turnover of the assessee for the purpose of computing the
allocation of R & D expenses without appreciating that the AO had applied the
same pro-rata method of allocating the R & D expenditure which the assessee
itself was applying for allocation of the R & D expenditure within the
assessee itself was applying for allocation of the R & D expenditure within
its units in the ratio of their turnover."
45\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances this ITAT in the own case of the assessee and Revenue bearing
ITA Nos. 1666/AHD/2016 and 1663/AHD/2016 vide order dated 08-09-2017 deleted
the addition made by AO.
46\. Both the Ld. AR and the DR before us relied on the order of respective
authorities below as favorable to them.
47\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on records. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee's (supra), the ITAT deleted the
addition made by the TPO/AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced
as under:
> "We have given a thoughtful consideration to the facts in issue before us.
> There is no dispute that the assessee did incurred expenditure under the
> head "Research & Development" activity. The only dispute relates to the .
> A.Y. 2009-10 allegation that part of such expenditure belong to the business
> activity of the partnership firm SPI. There is also no denying by the lower
> authorities that the entire Research and Development activities are done by
> the appellant company only being the flagship company of Sun Pharma Group.
> In our understanding of the facts, the appellant company had assisted the
> partnership firm in carrying on its business by using its network for
> marketing the pharmaceuticals products successively. Since the assessee is
> holding 97.5% of share in the partnership firm, SPI it becomes the duty of
> the assessee to promote the business of the partnership firm in the capacity

> not brought ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
> 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT

> anything on record which could suggest that the expenditures have not been

> First Appellate Authority. We, accordingly, direct the A.O. to delete the
> addition of Rs. 5,30,29,5255/-. Ground no. 12 is accordingly allowed"
48\. Regarding the Revenue appeal, the relevant finding of the ITAT in ITA
1663/AHD/2016 in its order is extracted below:
> "137. Similar issue has been considered and decided by us in assessee's
> appeal (supra) vide ground nos. 9 to 11 of that appeal. For our detailed
> discussion therein, ground no. 11 is dismissed."
49\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore respectfully following the finding of the Tribunal
(supra), we direct the AO accordingly.
49.1 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the ld.
Counsel for the assessee and the finding of the ld. CIT-A.
49.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By
Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 61 -
above-said judgment, we are of the considered opinion that the view adopted by
the co-ordinate bench as discussed above shall be applied in the case on hand
with full strength. The ld. DR and the ld. AR has not brought any decisions
varying from similar or identical facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio
decidendi rendered by the earlier order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be
followed by us in line and tune with the judicial discipline and decorum. In
view of the above and respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed
above, we allow the ground of appeal of the assessee and dismiss the ground of
appeal of the Revenue.
50\. The next issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 8 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in not allowing deduction of the remuneration received from the
partnership firms while determining the books profit under section 115JB of
the Act.
51\. The assessee in the year under consideration has received remuneration
from the partnership firm namely SPI amounting to Rs. 15,07,27,535/- which has
been reduced in computing the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act. The assessee
claimed that the remuneration paid to it by the firm was not allowed as a
deduction in the hands of the firm.
51.1. Accordingly, the assessee claimed that such remuneration is not taxable
in its hands as per proviso to section 28(v) r.w.s. 40(b) of the Act. The
assessee further submitted that such remuneration cannot also be ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 62 -
subject to tax under the section of 115JB of the Act. The assessee accordingly
reduces the amount of remuneration while working out the tax liability under
the provisions of section 115JB of the Act.
51.2. However, the AO disagreed with the contention of the assessee and held
that the amount of share of profit from the partnership is exempted from tax
under section 10(2A) of the Act. There is no exemption under section 10 of the
Act in respect of the remuneration received from the partnership firm.
Accordingly, the AO rejected the claim of the assessee and made the addition
of the remuneration while determining the book profit under section 115JB of
the Act.
52\. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> "14. Ground No. 11 is against the action of the Assessing Officer in not
> considering "remuneration" received from partnership firm (SPI) as share of
> profit to which provisions of section 10(2A) apply for the purpose of
> working of book profit u/s. 115JB. This issue has been discussed by the
> Assessing Officer in paras-6.1.3 and 6.1.4 of the assessment order. The
> appellant has claimed to have received remuneration of Rs.
> 15,07,27,535/-from partnership firm, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (SPI)
> which was deducted while working out the book profit u/s. 115JB by the
> appellant. On verification of the facts and material in records, the
> Assessing Officer held that only the share profit received from the firm can
> be excluded from the book profit.
> 14.1. This issue was also involved in A.Y. 2008-09 in the case of appellant.
> The CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad after considering the submission o. the appellant,
> has upheld the findings of the Assessing Officer. She has elaborately
> recorded her decision in paras-17.3 to 17.3.13 of the appellate order dated
> 14.10.2014. On the basis of various decisions of the Hon'ble

> is dismissed."
53\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A) the assessee is in appeal
before us.
54\. The Ld.AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA No. 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned addition was confirmed by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated
08-09-2017. As such the Ld.AR conceded for the above addition to the book
profit u/s 115JB of the act.
55\. On the other hand the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
56\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee (supra), the ITAT confirmed the
addition made by the TPO/AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced
as under:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

"60. This issue was also involved in the case of the appellant in A.Y. 2008-09
wherein the claim of deduction of remuneration received from the partnership
firm SPI for the determination of Book Profits u/s. 115JB was denied by the
revenue authorities. We find that when the matter was agitated before the
Tribunal, the Tribunal also declined to interfere with the findings of the ld.
CIT(A). The relevant findings of the Tribunal read as under:-
110\. We have considered the facts, circumstances, relevant provisions and
rival submissions,. A harmonious reading of the provisions of section 115JB of
the Act reflects that in the case of a company subject to the provisions of
Section 115JB of the Act has to prepare P&L statement in accordance with the
provisions of part
(ii) of Schedule (vi) of the Companies Act.
111\. The relevant clause of Explanation 1 reads as under:- Explanation [1]-
For the purposes of this section, "book profit" means the [profit] as shown in
the [statement of profit and loss] for the relevant previous year prepared
under sub-section (2), as increased by -
(f) the amount or amounts of expenditure relatable to any income to which
[section 10(other than the provisions contained in clause (38) thereof) or
[***] section 11 or section 12 apply; or]
112\. And as reduced by :-
(ii) the amount of income to which any of the provisions of [section 10 (other
than the provisions contained in clause (38) thereof) or [***] section 11 or
section 12 apply, if any such amount is credited to the [statement of profit
and loss]; or
113\. And section 10(2A) of the Act says that in the case of a person being a
partner of a firm which is separately assessed as such his share in the total
. A.Y. 2009-10 income of the firm will not form part of total income.
Explanation to Section 10(2A) provides that the share of a partner in the
total income of a firm separately assessed as such shall, notwithstanding,
anything contained in any other law, to be an amount which bears to the total
income of the firm, the same proportion as the amount of a share in the
profits of the firm in accordance with the partners deed bears to such
profits.
114\. Thus, it is clear that firstly the profit and loss account of the
company should be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies
Act. Secondly, only specified items have to be added back as provided in
various clauses to Explanation 1 and reduced by specific items provided
thereon. The only specific amount of income which has to be reduced is the
income to which provisions of Section 10, 11 or 12 apply, if any such amount
is credited to the Profit and Loss account and Section 10(2A) defines such
income as the share of profit of a partner from the partnership firm, the
language is clear and unambiguous and needs no other insertion or deletion.
The remuneration to partner may have the color of appropriation of profit of a
partnership firm as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 65 -
and Hon'ble High Courts in various decisions relied upon by the ld. Senior
Counsel but as mentioned elsewhere, Section 115JB is a complete code in
itself. Therefore, if the remuneration is credited by the appellant company in
its Profit and Loss account then the same could be reduced it specifically
provided under the Explanation to Section 115JB of the Act which we find
missing from the relevant provisions. We, therefore, do not find any merit in
this claim of the assessee and accordingly we confirm the findings of the
First Appellate Authority. Ground no. 9 is dismissed."
57\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore respectfully following the finding of the tribunal
(supra), we direct the AO accordingly. Moreover, we are bound to follow the
order of this Tribunal in the own case of the assessee in the earlier year as
the facts are identical in the impugned issue before us. It is also important
to note that the Ld. AR has not brought anything on record contrary to the
finding of the Ld. CIT-A.
57.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above-said judgment, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR and
the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical
facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier
order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune
with the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, the ground of appeal
of the assessee is dismissed.

58\. The issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 9 is that the Ld.CIT (A)
erred in reducing unrealized export proceeds amounting to Rs. 40,64,118/- from
export turnover.
59\. The AO during the assessment proceedings observed that the assessee had
claimed deduction under section 10B of the Act in respect of its 100% EOU
units namely Panoli new EOU and Halol EOU. However, the assessee in respect of
both the units failed to receive exports proceeds to the tune of Rs.
22,40,947/- in case of panoli new unit and Rs. 18,23,171/- in case of Halol
unit respectively within the time as prescribed under the law. Accordingly,
the AO reduces the amount mentioned above from the export turnover while
calculating the deduction under section 10B of the Act, and worked out
aggregate excess deduction claimed by the assessee for Rs. 12,83,234/- and
added the same to the total income of the assessee.
60\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> "16.2. I have carefully considered the facts on records and submission of
> the Ld.Authorized Representative. In respect of proportionate disallowance
> of deduction u/s.10B on unrealized sale proceeds of Rs.40,64,118/- from both

> view of the above discussion, Ground No.13 is dismissed."
61\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A) the assessee is in appeal
before us.
62\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA No.1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned issue was set aside to the AO for fresh adjudication by the Hon'ble
ITAT vide order dated 08-09-2017. Accordingly the Ld.AR for the assessee
requested to restore the impugned issue to the file of AO for fresh
adjudication as per the provision of law.
63\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
64\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee's (supra), the ITAT set aside
issue to the file of AO for fresh adjudication. The relevant extract of the
order is reproduced as under:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

65\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined to restore the issue to the file of
AO and direct accordingly for fresh adjudication as per the provisions of law.
Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own case of
the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the impugned
issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not brought
anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the ld. Counsel for
the assessee.

65.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above-said judgment, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR and
the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical
facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier
order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune
with the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, the ground of appeal
of the assessee is allowed for statistical purposes.
66\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 10 is that the Ld.
CIT-A erred in treating the repairing expenditure of Rs. 16,82,791/- as
capital in nature.
67\. The AO during the assessment proceedings observed that the assessee had
incurred Rs. 372.88 Million towards repairing expenses. The AO further found
that certain expenses are not in the nature of revenue expenses but of capital
in nature as detailed below:

68\. The assessee claimed that all these expenses are nothing but repair and
maintenance expenses incurred by it to keep the machinery in proper working
condition by replacing the existing part of the machinery and it does not by
itself create any new assets.
68.1. In relation to labor charges for HDPE pipeline assessee claimed that
such expenses were incurred by it to discharge the effluent generated from the
plants for compliance of the requirement of the GPCB as well as GIDC
authorities. These expenses do not bring any commercial ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 71 -
advantage to the assessee as well as there is no additional benefit derived by
it as compared to the original mode of discharge of effluent.
68.2 However, the AO disregarded the contention of the assessee by treating
the said revenue expense as capital. Accordingly, the AO disallowed the
expenses after giving the benefit of depreciation on the said capital
expenses. Thus the AO disallowed the remaining amount of Rs. 18,27,185/- and
added the same to the total income of the assessee.
69\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who partly
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> "17.2. I have carefully considered the facts on records and submission of
> the Ld. Authorized Representative. The issue under consideration is as to

70\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA# 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned issue was decided in its favor by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated
08-09-2017.
71\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

& 2012-13
\- 73 -
72\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we note that the impugned issue is not covered in
favor of the assessee as claimed by the Ld.AR of the assessee. The relevant
extract of the ITAT order (supra) is extracted below:
> "93.We have carefully considered the orders of the authorities below. We

> (a)Kiran Pumps for Rs. 1,59,000/-:- The assessee has purchased LUTZ Pump FLP

73\. The Ld. AR before us has also not pointed out any defect in the order of
the Ld. CIT-A. Thus in the absence of any argument by the ld.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 74 -
AR for the assessee, we do not find any reason to disturb the finding of the
ld. CIT-A. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is dismissed.
74\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 11 is that the Ld.
CIT-A erred in confirming the addition made by the AO u/s 14A of the Act.
75\. The AO during the assessment proceedings observed that the assessee had
claimed a deduction of Rs. 634.28 crores as a share of profit from partnership
firm u/s 10(2A) of the Act and Rs. 1.07 lacs as dividend income. The assessee
debited interest amount in profit & loss account amounting to Rs. 44,26,222/-
only. However, the assessee had not offered any disallowance of expenditure
for earning exempted income under section 14A of the Act.
75.1 On a question by the AO, the assessee claimed that it had not incurred
any interest expense for earning such exempt income. The assessee further
submitted that it had earned net interest income of Rs. 1047.70 million during
the year under consideration. The assessee also claimed that it has sufficient
owned fund exceeding the investment.
75.2. There is no direct and active involvement in the purchase and sale of
tax-free investments. The assessee has investments in its overseas
subsidiaries, mutual fund, and capital of partnership firms.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 75 -
75.3. In case of partnership firm, the profit accrued to it was not exempted
in the hands of the partnership firm. The partnership has credited only the
share of profit which is not the income in the hands of the partners but
credit to partner's capital account. Further assessee earned interest income
and remuneration from partnership firm which is taxable. Thus the provision of
section 14A does not apply to the investment in a partnership firm.
75.4. However, the AO disregarded the contention of the assessee and worked
out the disallowance in the manner provided under section 14A read with rule
8D of Income Tax Rule as given below:
Disallowance of interest expenses Rs. 5,82,987/- Disallowance of
administrative expenses Rs. 4,17,40,201/-
76\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who partly
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> "19. Ground No. 16 pertains to disallowance made u/s. 14A read with Rule 8D
> amounting to Rs.4,23,23,188/-. This issue has been discussed by the
> Assessing Officer in para-13 of the assessment order. The Assessing Officer

> Rs.44,2S/222/- during the year under consideration. Since the company has
> earned exempted income of Rs.634.29 crores from the partnership firm, the
> Assessing Officer invoked the provisions of section 14A read with Rule 8D
> and worked out consequential disallowance of a sum Of Rs,5,82,987/- out of
> the interest expenditure. The Assessing Officer has further disallowed a sum
> of Rs.4,17,40,201/- being 0.5% of average value of investment of Rs.
> 834,80,40,2297- resulting into exempt income. The similar disallowance was

> Ground No.16 is stands partly allowed."
77\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the assessee is in appeal
before us.
78\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA# 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned issue was decided in its favor by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated
08-09-2017
79\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
80\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we note that the impugned issue is not covered in
favor of the assessee as claimed by the Ld.AR of the assessee. As such it was
restored to the AO for fresh adjudication. The relevant extract of the ITAT
order (supra) is extracted below:
> "99.After considering the facts in issue before us. We find that a similar
> issue was decided by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 3297 and 3420/Ahd/2014 vide
> ground no. 17 of that appeal. The relevant findings read as under:-

> \- 77 -
> 52\. Coming to the disallowance made u/s. 14A by the First Appellate

> about the fact that Rule 8D is not applicable for the year under

> direct the A.O. to compute the disallowance so far as administrative
> expenditures are concerned as per Rule 8D of the ITAT Rules r.w.s. 14A of
> the Act. We accordingly set aside the disallowance of Rs. 27,55,18,783/-

> therefore, we direct the A.O. to compute the disallowance for administrative

> as allowed for statistical purpose."
81\. The Ld. AR before us has also not pointed out any defect in the order of
the Ld. CIT-A. Thus we find there is a contradiction between the argument of
the ld. AR for the assessee and in the finding of the ITAT. Admittedly the
rule 8D was applicable w.e.f. AY 2008-09 as observed by the ITAT in its order
as discussed above. We also note that in the AY 2008-09 the AO made the
disallowance as per rule 8D of income tax rule, but yet the ITAT restored the
issue to the file of AO to make disallowance as per rule 8D as discussed
above. Thus in order to maintain the consistency and to avoid the multiple
proceeding, we are inclined to restore the issue to the file of AO to
adjudicate afresh as per the direction of ITAT as discussed above. Hence the
ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purpose.

Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 78 -
82\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 12 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in confirming the addition made by AO of the expenses disallowed u/s
14A of the Act for computing the book profit u/s 115JB of the Act.
83\. The AO during the assessment made disallowance u/s 14A of the Act for Rs.
4,23,23,188/- under normal computation of income which was also added while
computing the book profit u/s 115JB of the Act.
84\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who confirmed
the order of the AO by observing that the AO made the similar addition in the
AY 2008-09 and his predecessor has confirmed the action of the AO. Therefore
the Ld.CIT (A) respectfully following the order of his predecessor upheld the
action of the AO.
85\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the assessee is in appeal
before us.
86\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA# 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned addition was deleted by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated 08-09-2017.
87\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 79 -
88\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee (supra), the ITAT deleted the
addition made by the TPO/AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced
as under:
> "104. The Tribunal in A.Y. 2008-09 in ITA No. 3297 & 3420/Ahd/2014 had the

> 82 taxmann.com 415. Ground no. 21 is accordingly allowed.
89\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore respectfully following the finding of the ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 81 -
tribunal (supra), we direct the AO accordingly to delete the addition of
expenses disallowed u/s 14A while computing the book profit u/s 115JB of the
Act. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
90\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 13 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in making the addition for selling and distribution expenses
incurred on behalf of SPI u/s 14A of the Act.
91\. During the appellate proceedings, the Ld. CIT (A) allocated selling &
distribution expenses and salary & allowance to field staff incurred by the
assessee amounting to Rs. 74,11,66,808/-to its partnership firms namely SPI
and SPS on the ground that such firms have utilized selling & distribution
network of the assessee.
91.1. The ld. CIT-A also observed that Hon'ble ITAT has decided the similar
issue in assessee's own case for AY 2004-05, ITA no 1193 & 1287/AHD/2008 dated
22-02-2016, in favor of it on the ground that the expenses incurred for
business.
91.2. However the Ld.CIT (A) was of the view that this expenditure of Rs.
74,11,66,808/- have been incurred for earning the exempt income from the
partnership firms in view of the undisputed facts that the assessee has earned
income from partnership firm at Rs. 634.29 crores as share profit which is not
forming part of the total income. Therefore these expenses cannot be allowed
as a deduction under section 14A of the Act.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 82 -
Hence the ld. CIT-A made the addition of Rs. 74,11,66,808/- u/s 14A r.w.r. 8D
and added to the total income of the assessee.
92\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A) the assessee is in appeal
before us.
93\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA# 1666/AHD/2016 the
impugned issue was decided in its favor by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated
08-09-2017
94\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of
authorities below.
95\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we note that the impugned issue is not covered in
favor of the assessee as claimed by the Ld.AR of the assessee. As such it was
restored to the AO for fresh adjudication. The relevant extract of the ITAT
order (supra) is extracted below:
> "64.On finding similarity of facts, we have no hesitation in following the
> decision of the Tribunal given in earlier year and the relevant findings
> read as under:-
> 153\. A similar issue was considered by the Bench in A.Y. 2007-08 in ITA No.
> 2076 & 2067/Ahd/2013 and the relevant findings read as under:-
> 52\. Coming to the disallowance made u/s. 14A by the First Appellate
> Authority, it is an undisputed fact that the assessee was having sufficient
> own funds for making the investment in the partnership firm. It is also true
> that the assessee was on a contractual obligation to look after the
> marketing and distribution activities of the firm SPI as per the partnership
> deed read along with the supplementary deed to earn ITA Nos.922 &
> 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee)
> DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 &
> 2012-13
> \- 83 -
> remuneration from the partnership firm. However, it is equally true that a
> reasonable disallowance of expenditure should be made for earning the exempt
> income so far as the share of profit from the partnership firm SPI is
> concerned. We are conscious about the fact that Rule 8D is not applicable
> for the year under consideration but at the same time for the computation of
> disallowance for administrative expenditures, the formula given under Rule
> 8D is the most appropriate method for the computation of the disallowance.
> We accordingly direct the A.O. to compute the disallowance so far as
> administrative expenditures are concerned as per Rule 8D of the ITAT Rules
> r.w.s. 14A of the Act. We accordingly set aside the disallowance of Rs.
> 27,55,18,783/- made by the First Appellate Authority and direct the A.O. to
> re-compute the disallowance as directed hereinabove. Ground no. 8 is allowed
> in part for statistical purpose."
96\. In view of the above, we find there is a contradiction between the
argument of the ld. AR for the assessee and in the finding of the ITAT. Thus
in order to maintain the consistency and to avoid the multiple proceeding, we
are inclined to restore the issue to the file of AO to adjudicate a fresh as
per the direction of ITAT as discussed above.
96.1 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the Ld. DR has not
brought anything on record contrary to the argument advanced by the Ld.
Counsel for the assessee.
96.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract of the order has already been reproduced above.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the said order, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By
Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 84 -
with full strength. The ld. DR and the ld. AR has not brought any decisions
varying from similar or identical facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio
decidendi rendered by the earlier order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be
followed by us in line and tune with the judicial discipline and decorum.
Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purpose.
97\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground no. 14 is related to
penalty proceeding u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act. However, the grievance of the
assessee is premature at this stage and therefore the same is accordingly
dismissed.
98\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.
Now we take up the Revenue's appeal in ITA No.922/Ahd/2017 for AY 2010-11
99\. The Revenue has raised the following grounds of appeal "1. On the facts
and in the circumstances of the case, and in law, earned CIT(A) erred in
educing the addition on account of interest on loans to AEs and on account of
0% OFCD by 1% ignoring the facts that 100 basis point increase was required on
account of Country and foreign exchange risk keeping in view substantial
foreign exchange risk involved on account of loan to the AE in dollar & severe
fluctuations in the foreign exchange.
2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, learned CIT(A) erred in
law and facts in reducing the adjustment on account of ALP for Corporate ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 85 -
Guarantee Fees from 2,96% to 2% since ALP for each year is assessed on the
basis of risk factor of that particular year and said ALP was worked out on
the basis of Country and foreign exchange risk
3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A)
erred in the law and facts in deleting the addition on account of price
difference on sales made to Sun Pharma Indusiries, even when the assessee has
not been able to controvert the finding of the AO that raw materials were
being sold to related concern at a rate lower than being sold to third
parties.
4\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A)
erred in the law and fads in deleting the addition weighted deduction made
u/s.35(2AB) on trade mark registration charges and overseas product
registration expenses of Rs.2,17,24,945/- by holding me capital expenditure as
expenditure revenue disregarding the facts of enduring benefits.
5\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, learned CIT(A) erred in
I:A and facts in deleting the addition on account of lunch & refreshment and
Brokerage on property when expenses do not relates to any R&D activity.
6\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. CIT (A) erred
in law and on facts in restricting the disallowance of R & D expenses after
excluding the export turnover of the assessee for the purpose of computing the
allocation of R & D expenses without appreciating that the AO had applied the
same pro-rata method of allocating the R&D expenditure which the assessee
itself was applying for allocation of the R&D expenditure within its units in
the ratio of their turnover.
7\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A)
erred in the law and facts in deleting the addition on account of provision of
Wealth tax for computation of book profit u/s 115JB without considering the
fact that provision for Wealth tax forms part of Income Tax Act, 1961 1 and,
therefore, provision of Wealth tax is to be added for the purpose of
determination of book profit u/s 115JB.
8\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A)
erred in the law and facts in not accepting the assessing officer's decision
to disallow w.r.t. section 801 A(4) of the Act and ignored the law as well as
fact that the said amount was not for infra structural development by an
undertaking as is provided u/s. 80IA(4) (i) read with explanation (a) to (d)
or (iv) of the said section.
9\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A)
erred in the law and facts in deleting the addition on account of disallowance
of expenditure incurred on behalf of its sister concern without appreciating
the fact that the assessee has used the said arrangements to shift the profit
and which is not allowable u/s.37 of the I.T.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 86 -
10\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, learned CIT(A) erred
in law and facts in directing to allow weighted deduction on the R&D expenses
which was not certified by DSIR without appreciating that as per provisions of
section 35(2AB), the assessee is eligible to for weighted deduction only in
respect of the amount which is certified by the prescribe authority i.e.
Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial research, government of
India."
100\. The first issue raised by the Revenue in Ground No. 1 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in reducing the addition on account of interest on loans to AEs on
account of 0% OFCD.
101\. The assessee in the earlier year has invested 224.93 crores in 0%
optionally fully convertible debenture (OFCD) in Sun Pharma Globla Inc. BVI.
The assessee claimed that it was in the nature of share capital. Therefore it
was not the international transaction. However, the TPO was of the view that
it is in the nature of loan until converted into the equity. Thus the
transaction should be benchmarked including the interest to determine the
arm's length. However, the assessee has not shown any income on this amount
and also not benchmarked the investment in the TP study. Accordingly, the TPO
considered the OFCD as debt and proposed the interest rate at 12-month LIBOR
plus markup 414.76 to work out the ALP on such amount.
101.1 However, the assessee in reply to the notice submitted that the
outstanding OFCD as on 01-04-2009 have been converted into equity shares in
the year 2010-11 and filed the details as under:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 87 -
> OFCD outstanding as on 1st April, 224.93 crores  2009 OFCDs converted into
> equity shares 202.54 crores on 5th March, 2010 on following terms:
> [Face Value of USD 1/Rs45 and Premium of USD 45/Rs.2025] The OFCDs have been
> converted at the rates decided under the OFCD terms that are enclosed for
> Your Honours' reference.
OFCD Outstanding as on 1st April, 22.39 crores 2010 Which are converted into
equity shares in FY 10-11 101.2 Assessee received 9,78,260 share at the price
of Rs. 2070 which much lower than the book value of shares. Thus the assessee
was compensated by way of shares issue at a lower rate.
101.3 However, the TPO rejected the contention of the assessee by observing
that until OFCD are converted into equity, it should be treated as debt.
Accordingly, the TPO computed the interest on investment in OFCD of Sun Pharma
Global BVI by applying interest rate at 12-month Libor (i.e., 1.28%) plus
spread 4.15% aggregating to 5.43% and worked out the amount of Rs.
11,24,64,144/- and added to the total income of the assessee.
102\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who
deleted the addition by the AO by reliance on the order of the ITAT dated
10-05-2016 in assessee's case in ITA Nos. 1589 & 1592/AHD/2011 for AY 2006-07.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 88 -
"6.3. Since the facts were identical in A.Y. 2009-10 and the appellant had
also furnished identical submission during the course of appellate
proceedings, I had held that the OFCDs remained debt until they are converted
into equity on a future date at an option of the investor. Accordingly, Arm's
Length predetermined by TPO was upheld in A.Y. 2009-10, subject to 1%
reduction in interest rate benchmarked for I exchange fluctuation risks.
However, now this issue stands decided in 1 the favour of appellant, vide
order dated 10.05.2016 of Hon'ble ITAT, Ahmedabad contained in ITA No. 1589 &
1592/AHD/2011 (A.Y. 2006-07). In that case the TPO made following
adjustments:-
(i) Interest on loan to AEs at LOBOR plus rate allowed to AEs Rs.
7,83,82,483/-
(ii) Interest on 9% OFCD Rs.21,08,42,301/-
The relevant portion of order of Hon'ble ITAT is reproduced as under:-
"7. Assessee carried the matter before the Ld. CIT(A) and reiterated its
claim.
After considering the facts and the submissions, the Id. CIT(A) reduced the
interest to LIBOR+0.25% from LIBOR+2%. The assessee is disputing the
LIBOR+0.25% and the revenue is in dispute for the deletion of 1.75%.
8\. We have heard the rival contentions and have carefully perused the orders
of the authorities below. At the very outset, we have to state that the
revenue has no power to re-characterize the transaction. The Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in the case of Cotton Naturals India Pvt. Ltd. 276 CTR 445 at
para 17 of its order has held that Chapter X and Transfer Pricing rules do not
permit the Revenue authorities to step into the shoes of the assessee and
decide whether or not a transaction should not be entered. It is for the
assessee to take commercial decisions and decide how to conduct and carry on
its business. Actual business transactions that are legitimate cannot be
restructured. A similar view was taken by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the
case of EKL Appliances Ltd. 345 ITR 241.
9\. On identical set of facts, the Co-ordinate Bench had the occasion to
consider similar issue in the case of Cadila Healthcare Ltd. in ITA No.
2430/Ahd/12 with C.O. No. 242/Ahd/12 in 146 ITR 502 wherein the first ground
related to the adjustment made on account of notional interest on Optionally
Convertible Debenture to Foreign Subsidiary. The Tribunal considered the
following facts :-
4\. During the course of assessment proceedings, Assessing Officer noticed
that Assessee had subscribed to Optionally Convertible Loan of U.S. $ 27
Million issued by Zydus International Pvt. Ltd., Ireland. Accordingly
reference under Section 92CA of the Act for computing of arms length price in
relation to the transaction was made to transfer Pricing Officer (TPO), TPO
noted that the Assessee had entered into an agreement with Zydus International
Pvt. Ltd. on 09.10.2007 for a convertible loan of U.S $ 27 Million which was
subsequently utilized by the Ireland Company for acquiring shares in Zydus
Healthcare, Brazil. As per the terms of agreement, ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017
(By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 89 -
no interest was payable if the amount was converted into equity. However, if
the same is redeemed, interest was payable at Libor Plus 290 bps and the
interest was to be computed at annual rates and payable at maturity that is 5
years from the date of first disbursement. The rupee value of the amount of
loan as on 31.03.2008 was Rs.108.32 crore. It was also noticed that Assessee
has not shown any income from the aforesaid loan. In response, Assessee
interalia submitted that Assessee had not opted for conversion of the loan
during the year and therefore it was loan for the year and as per the terms of
agreement, no interest accrued to the Assessee and therefore no income was
considered. The TPO did not find the contention of the Assessee acceptable. He
considered the Optionally Fully Convertible loan as debt and considering the
average six month Euro Libor rate for the year @ 4.48% to which he added the
interest rate of 2.90 basis point as per the agreement and thereafter
considered the rate of interest to be @ 7.38% and accordingly computed the
interest on Rs.108.32 Crore for 171 days at 7.38%. The aforesaid adjustment
made by the TPO was considered by the Assessing Officer and the addition of
Rs.3,99,74,426/- was made to the income. Aggrieved by the order of Assessing
Officer, Assessee carried the matter before CIT(A). CIT(A) after considering
the submissions made by the Assessee decided the issue in favour of Assessee.
10\. And the Tribunal held as under:-
7\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the material on record.
CIT(A) while deleting the addition has noted that as per the agreement, the
interest was payable only if the conversion option was not exercised on the
expiry of 5 year period. If at any time during the 5 year period conversion
option was exercised and the loan was converted into equity, no interest
accrued or become payable. He further noted that the funds were provided by
the Assessee as per RBI guidelines and in the immediately next year, the
entire loan given to subsidiary was converted into equity shares of Zydus
International Pvt. Ltd. He has further held that since the Assessee has
converted the loan into equity in the immediate next year, there was no
question of taxing notional interest. He has further held that Assessee had
not. granted interest free loan but invested in optionally convertible loan i
with a clause of interest in case, Conversion option was not exercised and
further held the Assessee's transaction with subsidiary was at arms length.
Before us, the Revenue could not controvert the findings of CIT(A) by bringing
any contrary material on record. In view of these facts, we find no reason to
interfere with the order of CIT(A).
11\. Respectfully following the findings of the Hon'ble High Court (supra) and

103\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A) the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
104\. The Ld. DR before us filed the written submissions which are available
on record. But the same has not been reproduced for the sake of brevity and
convenience. The ld. DR vehemently supported the order of the order of AO.
105\. On the other hand the Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical
facts and circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA# 1666/AHD/2016
the impugned addition was deleted by the Hon'ble ITAT vide order dated
08-09-2017.
106\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee's (supra), the ITAT deleted the
addition made by the TPO/AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced
as under:
> "19. Shri G.C. Shrivastava referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
> Court in the case of Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd. in Civil
> Appeal No. 9813 of 2011\. It is contended that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
> explained the nature of OFCDs and have held that OFCDs are hybrid securities

whereas in the case in hand, the assessee has not produced comparable data to
justify that OFCDs were issued at arm's length price. It is strongly contended
that since these facts have not been brought on record, therefore, the Bench
should not follow its earlier decision.
20\. Shri Soparkar ld. senior counsel replying to the submissions of
revenuestated that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Sahara India Real Estate (Civil Application) No. 9813 of 2011 relied upon by
the learned DR is not applicable to the issue before the Hon'ble ITAT. Even if
it is held that OFCD is a hybrid instrument as laid down by the Supreme Court,
in applying the Transfer Pricing Provisions, the entire instrument has to be
considered and the same cannot be re-characterized partly as loan and partly
as equity so as to enable any transfer pricing adjustment for the same. In
this regard, we rely on the decisions cited earlier, which have been
appropriately followed by the Hon'ble ITAT in A.Y. 2007-08 and the decision of
the Supreme Court (supra) cited by the ld. DR does not in any way justify any
departure from the decision laid down in A.Y. 2007-08.
21\. Adverting to ld. DR's contention that the terms of OFCDs and comparables
have not been submitted, it is contended that the terms of OFCDs were duly
submitted before the lower authorities in the form of Annexure B which is part
of the PB. Similarly the allegation that assessee has not brought on record
any comparable transactions to show that non-charging of interest was at arms-
length and it got compensated by favorable terms similar to that offered by
uncontrolled entities is also strongly refuted. It is contended all the
relevant details and comparable were furnished as Annexure B in which it has
been submitted that the conversion of OFCD into equity shares at a price of
USD 21- USD 51 per share as against the net asset value of the shares at the
relevant point in time being USD 87 per share. Thus it is clear that the OFCDs
were convertible into shares at significant discount to the prevailing book
value of the shares giving rise to sizeable benefit on OFCDs. It is also
submitted that the OFCDs have been converted into equity shares in the
subsequent years; hence, the question of payment of any interest on the OFCDs
would not arise, as the same is fully towards capital account. The Ld Senior
counsel continued by saying that the Hon'ble ITAT in A.Y. 2007-08 and in
earlier years has not committed any error whatsoever in coming to the
conclusion, which is duly supported by other decisions and the position
prevailing under Law. Hence no departure is called for much less due to the
decision of Supreme Court in Sahara (supra).
22\. We have given a thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions qua the
issue. Adverting to the claim of revenue that in the earlier year, the bench
has not considered certain facts while relying upon the decision of the Co-
ordinate Bench in the case of Cadila Healthcare.
23\. The Hon'ble High Court in the case of A.P.V. Kokkiliagada Meerayya, Masud
Khan has laid down the following :
28\. There can be no dispute with respect to the settled legal proposition
that a judgment of this Court is binding, particularly, when the same is that
of a coordinate Bench, or of a larger Bench. It is also correct to state that,
even if a particular issue ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 92 -
has not been agitated earlier, or a particular argument was advanced, but was
not considered, the said judgment does not lose its binding effect, provided
that the point with reference to which an argument is subsequently advanced,
has actually been decided. The decision therefore would not lose its
authority, "merely because it was badly argued, inadequately considered or
fallaciously reasoned". The case must be considered taking note of the ratio
decidendi of the same i.e. the general reasons, or the genera! grounds upon
which the decision of the court is based, or on the test or abstract, of the
specific peculiarities of the particular case, which finally gives rise to the
decision.(Vide Somawanti v. State of Punjab, Ballabhadas Mathurdas Lakhani v.
Municipal Committee, Matkapui, Ambika Prasad Mishra v. State of U.P and
Director of Settlements v. M.R. Apparao.)
24\. The Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court of Gujarat in the case of Core
Healthcare Ltd. 251 ITR 61 has observed as under:-
As laid down by the apex court in the case of Ambika Prasad Mishra v. State of
U.P., AIR 1980 SC 1762 ; [1980] 3 SCC 719 (page 1764 of AIR 1980 SC): "Every
new discovery or/argumentative novelty cannot undo or compel econsideration of
a binding precedent . . .
a decision does not lose its authority 'merely because it was badly argued,
inadequately considered and fallaciously reasoned' . . ."
Similarly in the case of Kesho Ram and Co. v. Union of India [1989] 3 SCC 151,
it is stated by the Supreme Court thus (page 160):
"The binding effect of a decision of this court does not depend upon whether a
particular rgument was considered or not, provided the point with reference to
which the argument is advanced subsequently was actually decided in the
earlier decision ..."
25\. A similar view is again taken by the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court of
Gujarat in th case of Nirma Industries Ltd. 283 ITR 402. Coming to the facts
of the year under consideration, we do not find any distinction from the
decision taken in earlier assessment year by the Bench and the relevant
findings read as under:-
8\. We have heard the rival contentions and have carefully perused the orders
of the authorities below. At the very outset, we have to state that the
revenue has no power to re-characterize the transaction. The Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in the case of Cotton Naturals India Pvt. Ltd. 276 CTR 445 at
para 17 of its order has held that Chapter X and Transfer Pricing rules do not
permit Revenue authorities to step into the shoes of the assessee and decide
whether or not a transaction should not be entered. It is for the assessee to
take commercial decisions and decide how to conduct and carry on its business.
Actual business transactions that are legitimate cannot be restructured. A
similar view was taken by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of EKL
Appliances Ltd. 345 ITR 241.
9\. On identical set of facts, the Co-ordinate Bench had the occasion to
consider similar issue in the case of Cadila Healthcare Ltd. in ITA No.
2430/Ahd/12 with C.O. No. 242/Ahd/12 in 146 ITR 502 wherein the first ground
related to the adjustment ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 93 -
made on account of notional interest on Optionally Convertible Debenture to
Foreign Subsidiary. The Tribunal considered the following facts:-
4\. During the course of assessment proceedings, Assessing Officer noticed
that Assessee had subscribed to Optionally Convertible Loan of U.S. $ 27
Million issued by Zydus International Pvt. Ltd., Ireland. Accordingly
reference under Section 92CA of the Act for computing of arms length price in
relation to the transaction was made to Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO). TPO
noted that the Assessee had entered into an agreement with Zydus International
Pvt. Ltd. on 09.10.2007 for a convertible loan of U.S $ 27 Million which was
subsequently utilized by the Ireland Company for acquiring shares in Zydus
Healthcare, Brazil. As per the terms of agreement, no interest was payable if
the amount was converted into equity. However, if the same is redeemed,
interest was payable at Libor Plus 290 bps and the interest was to be computed
at annual rates and payable at maturity that is 5 years from the date of first
disbursement. The rupee value of the amount of loan as on 31.03.2008 was Rs.
108.32 crore. It was also noticed that Assessee has not shown any income from
the aforesaid loan. In response, Assessee interalia submitted that Assessee
had not opted for conversion of the loan during the year and therefore it was
loan for the year and as per the terms of agreement, no interest accrued to
the Assessee and therefore no income was considered. The TPO did not find the
contention of the Assessee acceptable. He considered the Optionally Fully
Convertible loan as debt and considering the average six month Euro Libor rate
for the year @ 4.48% to which he added the interest rate of 2.90 basis point
as per the agreement and thereafter considered the rate of interest to be @
7.38% and accordingly computed the interest on Rs. 108.32 Crore for 171 days
at 7.38%. The aforesaid adjustment made by the TPO was considered by the
Assessing Officer and the addition of Rs. 3,99,74,4267- was made to the
income. Aggrieved by the order of Assessing Officer, Assessee carried the
matter before CIT(A). CIT(A) after considering the submissions made by the
Assessee decided the issue in favour of Assessee.
10\. And the Tribunal held as under:-
7\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the material on record.
CIT(A) while deleting the addition has noted that as per the agreement, the
interest was payable only if the conversion option was not exercised on the
expiry of 5 year period. If at any time during the 5 year period conversion
option was exercised and the loan was converted into equity, no interest
accrued or become payable. He further noted that the funds were provided by
the Assessee as per RBI guidelines and in the immediately next year, the
entire loan given to subsidiary was converted into equity shares of Zydus
International Pvt. Ltd. He has further held that since the Assessee has
converted the loan into equity in the immediate next year, there was no
question of taxing notional interest. He has further held that Assessee had
not granted interest free loan but invested in optionally convertible loan
with a clause of interest in case, Conversion option was not exercised and
further held the Assessee's transaction with subsidiary was at arms length.
Before us, the Revenue could not controvert the findings of CIT(A) by bringing
any contrary material on record. In view of these facts, we find no reason to
interfere with the order of CIT(A).
11\. Respectfully following the findings of the Hon'ble High court (supra) and
the Co-ordinate Bench (supra), we direct the A.O to delete the impugned
additions. Ground no. 2 is accordingly allowed.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 94 -
26\. Thus, the distinguishing facts as canvassed by the Shri Shrivastava do
not culminate in to any proposition so as to convince us to take any
divergence from earlier findings and the judicial discipline also guides us to
follow the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench in the light of the ratio laid
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court of
Gujarat (supra) and considering the fact that the OFCD were on beneficial
terms as per facts mentioned above. Consequently, we have no hesitation to
follow earlier judgment in assessee's own case as a result we delete the
impugned additions. Ground No. 3 of assessee is allowed."
107\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined not to disturb the finding of the
Ld.CIT (A). Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the
own case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the Ld. DR has not
brought anything on record against the finding of the Ld. CIT-A, and the
argument advanced by the Ld. Counsel for the assessee.
107.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.) wherein it was held as under: "No Tribunal of fact has any right or
jurisdiction to come to a conclusion entirely contrary to the one reached by
another Bench of the same Tribunal on the same facts. It may be that the
members who constituted the Tribunal and decided on the earlier occasion were
different from the members who decided the case on the present occasion. But
what is relevant is not the personality of the officers presiding over the
Tribunal or participating in the hearing but the Tribunal as an institution.
If it is to be conceded that simply because of the change in the personnel of
the officers who manned the Tribunal, it is open to the new officers to come
to a conclusion totally contradictory to the conclusion which had been reached
by the earlier officers manning the same Tribunal on the same set of facts, it
will not only shake the confidence of the public in judicial procedure as
such, but it will also totally destroy such confidence. The result of this
will be conclusions based on arbitrariness and whims and fancies of the
individuals presiding over the Courts or the Tribunals and not reached
objectively on the basis of the facts placed before the authorities.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 95 -
If a Bench of a Tribunal on the identical facts is allowed to come to a
conclusion directly opposed to the conclusion reached by another Bench of the
Tribunal on an earlier occasion, that will be destructive of the institutional
integrity itself. That is the reason why in a High Court, if a single Judge
takes a view different from the one taken by another Judge on a question of
law, he does not finally pronounce his view and the matter is referred to a
Division Bench. Similarly if a Division Bench differs from the view taken by
another Division Bench it does not express disagreement and pronounce its
different views, but has the matter posted before a Fuller Bench for
considering the question. If that is the position even with regard to a
question of law, the position will be a fortiori with regard to a question of
fact. If the Tribunal wants to take an opinion different from the one taken by
an earlier Bench, it should place the matter before the President of the
Tribunal, so that he could have the case referred to a Full Bench of the
Tribunal consisting of three or more members for which there is provision in
the IT Act itself."
107.2 In the light of the ratio decidendi above we are of the considered
opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed above
shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR before us
has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical facts or
circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier order of
the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune with the
judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.
108\. The issue raised in the ground no. 2 is that the Ld.CIT(A) erred in
reducing the adjustment on account of ALP for Corporate Guarantee Fees from
2.96% to 2%.
108.1 An identical issue has been considered and decided by us in assessee's
appeal in ITA 929/AHD/2017 vide ground no. 2 and in Para 13 of this order.
Thus respectfully following the same as discussed in detail ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 96 -
therein, we order accordingly. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
treated as allowed for statistical purpose.
109\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 3 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition made by AO on account of the price
difference on sales made to SPI for Rs. 3,50,78,887/-.
110\. During the assessment proceedings, the AO found that the assessee had
been selling the certain raw material/product to its partnership firm namely
SPI at a price lower than the priced charged from third parties. As such the
AO was of the view that the assessee is shifting its profit to its partnership
firm being eligible for the deduction u/s 80IB of the Act.
111\. On a question by AO, the assessee submitted that the difference in the
rate was there in few transactions with the firm which was minor. The assessee
also explained the difference in price due to the following reason:
1) There was a difference in the quality of the product sold to its related
parties. The related parties were sold lower quality as compared to outside
parties product.
2) The volume of transactions with related parties is insignificant as against
the third parties.
3) Assessee does not have to bear inventory carrying the cost, marketing cost,
for the product supply to its related concerns.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 97 -
4) There was no credit risk involved in respect of transaction with related
concerns.
5) Other similar factors like the low volume of sale to third/outside parties.
111.1. The assessee has not received any amount over and above the price
charge from the related concerns. Further, the Provisions of section 40A(2)(b)
are applicable only concerning the expenses and not the income.
111.2. However, the AO rejected the contention of the assessee and worked out
the disallowance due to price difference at Rs. 3,50,78,887/- and added to the
total income of the assessee.
112\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who deleted the
addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "15.1 Under the identical facts and circumstances of the case, the addition
> was also made in A.Y. 2008-09 and CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad, had allowed part
> relief to the appellant on the ground that the difference in the sales price

114\. Both the parties before us vehemently supported the order of authorities
below as favorable to them.
115\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA 1663/AHD/2016 vide order
dated 8-9-2017, the ITAT has deleted the addition made by the TPO/AO. The
relevant extract of the order is reproduced as under:
> "114. Since, the First Appellate Authority has followed the order of the
> Tribunal in ITA Nos. 1589/Ahd/2011 and 2430/Ahd/2009, therefore, we do not
> find any error or infirmity in the findings of the ld. CIT(A). Ground no. 3
> is accordingly dismissed."
116\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined not to disturb the finding of the
Ld.CIT (A). Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the
own case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record against the finding of the ld. CIT-A, and the
argument advanced by the ld. Counsel for the assessee.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 99 -
116.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract of the order has already been reproduced above.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the said order, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR has
not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical facts or
circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier order of
the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune with the
judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.
117\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 4 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition of weighted deduction made under section
35(2AB) of the Act on trademark registration charges and overseas product
registration expenses of Rs. 2,17,24,945/-.
117.1 During assessment proceedings the AO found that the assessee has claimed
the weighted deduction in respect of R & D expenses @ 150% on the following
amounts:
Trademark registration charges Rs. 67,10,905/- Overseas product registration
charges Rs. 3,67,38,983/-
118\. On perusal of the above, the AO observed that these expenses were
incurred for registration of drug, patent in foreign countries. Therefore,
these expenses are not covered under explanation to section ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 100 -
35(2AB) of the Act. Accordingly, the AO held that no weighted deduction in
respect of such expenses could be claimed under section 35(2AB) of the Act.
Thus the AO disallowed the excess weighted deduction claimed by the assessee
amounting to Rs. 2,17,24,495/- and added to the total income of the assessee.
119\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who
deleted the addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "10. Ground No. 7 is against the action of the Assessing Officer in holding
> that the trade mark registration charges of Rs.67,10,905/- and overseas
> product registration charges of Rs.3,67,38,983/- are not eligible for
> weighted deduction-and accordingly, the Assessing Officer disallowed a sum

120\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
121\. Both the parties before us vehemently supported the order of authorities
below as favorable to them.

circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA 1666/AHD/2016 vide order
dated 8-9-2017 where the ITAT deleted the addition made by the TPO/AO. The
relevant extract of the order is reproduced as under:

. A.Y. 2009-10 counsel for the assessee stated that the Tribunal in assessee's
own case in earlier years has decided this issue in favour of the assessee and
against the revenue in ITA No. 1558/Ahd/2006. The ld. D.R. could not bring any
distinguishing decision in favour of the revenue.
14\. We have given a thoughtful consideration to the order of the Tribunal in
earlier years; we find that the Tribunal while deciding the issue in favour of
the assessee has followed the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench, Mumbai in the
case of USV Ltd. 54 SOT 615. Findings of the Tribunal read as under:-
24\. We have carefully perused the orders of the authorities below. We find
that the ld. CIT(A) has simply followed the findings of his predecessor for
A.Y. 2000-01. We also find that the assessment order for A.Y. 2000-01 has been
quashed by the Tribunal vide a ITA Nos. 1199 & 1279/Ahd/2006, which means that
the basis for upholding the disallowance has been removed. We further find
that on identical set of facts, the Mumbai Bench in the case of USV Ltd.
(supra) has allowed the claim of the assessee in respect of expenditure
incurred in respect of patent application. Respectfully, following the
findings of the co-ordinate Bench (supra), we direct the A.O to delete the
disallowance of Rs. 44,71,906/-. Ground no. 10 is accordingly allowed.
15\. Respectfully following the detailed findings given, we direct the A.O to
allow the impugned weighted deduction. Ground no. 3 is accordingly allowed.
35.We direct accordingly. Ground no. 6 is allowed.
48.As no distinguishing fact has been considered by the lower authorities,
respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal (supra), we direct the
A.O. to allow weighted deduction. Ground no. 11 is allowed".
123\. As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined not to disturb the finding of the
Ld.CIT (A). Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the
own case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record against the finding of the ld. CIT-A, and the
argument advanced by the ld. Counsel for the assessee.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 103 -
123.1 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract of the order has already been reproduced above.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the said order, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR has
not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical facts or
circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier order of
the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune with the
judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.
124\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 5 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in allowing the weighted deduction claimed under section 35(2AB) of
the Act in respect of lunch/refreshment of expenses and brokerage of the
property.
124.1 The assessee in respect of research and development expenses has claimed
weighted deduction under section 35(2AB) of the Act. However, the AO on
perusal of the details of research and development expenses found that it has
incurred certain expenses which are not eligible for weighted deduction. The
details of such expenses are reproduced as under:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 104 -
    Lunch & Refreshment Expenses             Rs.5,09,964/-
    Brokerage for Property                   Rs. 31,000/-
> 125\. On a question by the AO, the assessee submitted that lunch and
> refreshments expenses had been incurred on the employees exclusively working
> with the research & development divisions. These expenses also represent the
> expenses incurred for the guest, visitors, dignitaries and the other
> professionals visiting exclusively to the research and development center.
126\. All the centers are independent units, and these do not share any common
space with the manufacturing factories of the assessee. As such these expenses
were representing the expenses incurred exclusively in connection with the
research and development division.
127\. The assessee regarding the brokerage expenses submitted that these
expenses were paid to the brokers/estate agents for locating the residential
units for the employees working with the research and development divisions.
As such these expenditures were incurred exclusively for the purpose of the
research and development divisions.
127.1 However, the AO disagreed with the submission of the assessee by
observing that the expenses do not relate with the research and development
activities. Accordingly, the AO held that no weighted deduction in respect of
such expenses can be claimed under section ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By
Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 105 -
35(2AB) of the Act. Thus the AO disallowed the excess weighted deduction
claimed by the assessee amounting to Rs. 2,70,482/- and added to the total
income of the assessee.
128\. The aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who
deleted the addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "11. Vide Ground No. 8, the appellant has challenged disallowance of
> weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) on expenditure pertaining to lunch and
> refreshment at Rs.5,09,964/- and brokerage on property at Rs.31,000/-. This
> issue has been discussed by the Assessing Officer in para-11,1 and 11.2 of
> the assessment order. I find that the facts pertaining to this issue as well
> as submission of the appellant are similar to A,Y. 2008-09 where the similar
> disallowance was also made. The CIT(A)- IV, Ahmedabad vide her order dated
> 14.10.2014, allowed the weighted deduction after elaborately discussing the
> facts and reasons in para-10.3 and 12.4 of the order. Since, these expenses
> relating to lunch and refreshment were pertaining to the employees engaged
> in R&D activities and brokerage was paid for the property used in R&D
> Centre, it was held that these expenses qualify for weighted deduction at
> 150%, Since the facts are identical in this year also, I respectfully
> following the order of CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad, direct the Assessing Officer to
> allow weighted deduction at 150% on lunch and refreshment and brokerage for
> property. Thus, Ground No. 8 is allowed."
129\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
130\. Both the parties before us vehemently supported the order of authorities
below as favorable to them.
131\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee Revenue appeal ITA No ITA

1663/AHD/2016, the ITAT deleted the addition made by the AO. The relevant
extract of the order is reproduced as under:

131.3 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court

132\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 6 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in directing the AO to exclude the export turnover for allocating
the expenses.

131A We have already decided the impugned issues against the Revenue and in
favor of the assessee in the ground of appeal bearing no. 7 vide Para No.42 to
45 of this order in ITA 929/AHD/2017. Thus respectfully following the same, we
do not find any reason to disturb the finding of the ld. CIT-A. Hence the
ground of appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
133\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 7 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition on account of the provision of wealth tax
for computation of book profit u/s 115JB of the Act.
133.1 The assessee while calculating book profit u/s 115JB of the Act has not
added back the provision for wealth tax of Rs. 10,33,413/-.
133.2 On a question by Assessing Officer, the assessee submitted that
provision for wealth tax does not fall under any of the adjustment of clause
(a) to (i) of the explanation to section 115JB (2) of the Act.
133.3 Further, submitted that clause (a) of the said explanation refers to the
amount of income tax paid or payable and the provision thereof. Though income
tax and wealth tax are a direct tax their nature and computation are not
similar at all.
134\. However, the AO disagreed with the submission of the assessee by
observing that the provision of wealth tax is in the similar nature of
provision of income tax as well as deferred tax. Therefore wealth tax ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13

should also be added to book profit for the calculation of MAT. Thus the AO
added the provision for wealth tax for Rs 10,33,413/-to the book profit u/s
115JB of the Act.
135\. Aggrieved assessee, preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who deleted
the addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "13. Ground No.10 is against the action of the Assessing Officer in adding
> the provisions of Wealth-tax of Rs.10,33,413/- to the book profit for

said order, we are of the considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-
ordinate bench as discussed above shall be applied in the case on hand with
full strength. The ld. DR has not brought any decisions varying from similar
or identical facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered
by the earlier order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in
line and tune with the judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of
appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
139\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 8 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition made by AO under section 80IA(4) of the Act
for Rs. 1,83,99,656/-.
139.1 The assessee in the year under consideration has not claimed a deduction
of Rs. 75,37,561/-u/s 80IA(4) of the Act in its return and the revised return
of income as there was no positive income in the computation of income. But
the assessee claimed that it has the right to claim the deduction u/s 80IA(4)
of the Act as and when necessary as per the provision of law.
139.2 All the units engaged in the business of the electricity, maintain
separate books of account of each unit and same is audited under the Act. The
assessee further submitted that the sale of such unit becomes the purchases of
other units. As such the profit derived by the said unit is included in the
total income of the assessee.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 112 -
139.3 However, the AO disagreed with the submission of the assessee by
observing that the income of the assessee turn positive due to various
addition being made in the assessment. The assessee nowhere added the profit
of the undertaking in the gross total income or computation of the income of
the company. Therefore assessee failed to fulfill the primary condition. Thus
the claim of Rs. 1,83,99,656/-u/s 80IA(4) is disallowed.
140\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who deleted the
addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "18. Ground No.15 is against the action of Assessing Officer in disallowing

143.1 As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined not to disturb the finding of the
Ld.CIT (A). Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the
own case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record against the finding of the ld. CIT-A, and the
argument advanced by the ld. Counsel for the assessee.
143.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract of the order has already been reproduced above.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the said order, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR has
not brought any decisions varying from ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By
Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 115 -
similar or identical facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi
rendered by the earlier order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed
by us in line and tune with the judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the
ground of appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
144\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 9 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition made by AO under section 37 of the Act for
Rs. 74,11,66,808/-on account of expenses incurred on behalf of its sister
concerns.
144.1 The AO on verification of the partnership deed between assessee and SPI
found that the assessee provides certain services like marketing of the
product, advising on technical matters, advising on product stability and
positioning, etc. The assessee for such services is entitled to receive 5%
remuneration of the net profit of SPI.
144.2 During the year under consideration, assessee received 5% of net profit
of SPI, i.e. Rs. 15,07,27,535/- under the head remuneration.
144.3 However, the SPI had not debited this remuneration in its profit & loss
account because of section 40(b) of the Act. The AO was of the view that as
per the explanation of section working partners mean an individual who
actively engaged in the business of the firm. In the present case assessee is
not an individual but a company. Thus the provisions of the section do not
apply to the remuneration paid to the ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue)
and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 116 -
company. Therefore the remuneration was not debited in the profit& loss
account.
144.4 Thus, the assessee has not offered such remuneration to tax because of
section 28(v) of the Act. However, the expenses incurred by the assessee on
behalf of the SPI duly debited in its profit & loss accounts which are not
incurred exclusively for the business as per section 37 of the Act. On a
question by the AO assessee submitted that the assessee already had a well-
established marketing and distribution network and required personnel for
carrying out such activities. The assessee is an established pharmaceuticals
player in the industry for a long time and is having a large pool of field
force comprised various divisions across the country to market the
pharmaceutical product successfully. It was a good synergy for the assessee to
take this opportunity of marketing SPI and SPS's products by utilizing this
existing field force without extra efforts and costs. No additional expenses
have been incurred by the assessee, for the services rendered by it to the
firms.
144.5 Without prejudice to the above, the assessee also submitted that SPI has
also incurred certain selling & distribution expenses amounting to Rs. 224.30
lakhs.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 117 -
144.6 Without prejudice to the above, any expenses incurred to earn the
remuneration would be deductible as expenses incurred in the course of
carrying on the business.
145\. However, the AO disagreed with the submission of the assessee by
observing that it is impossible to assume that the assessee has not incurred
any expenses on making such a huge sale on behalf of SPI. In the absence of
detail of expenses incurred by it on behalf of SPI and perusal of other
expense, personnel cost debited by assessee the following expenses directly
related to assessee's function performed on behalf of SPI Selling &
distribution expenses Rs. 122,29,47,629/- Salary and advance to field staff
Rs. 76,91,47,335/-
            Total                                          Rs. 199,20,94,983/-
    145.1       These expenses divided into three concerns in their turnover
ratio. The ratio of both partnership firms are 37.21 % (SPI 16.49% + SPS
20.72%) accordingly Rs, 74,11,66,808/- expenses are disallowed u/s 37 of the
Act, as incurred on behalf of them by the assessee.
146\. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld.CIT (A) who deleted
the addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> "21.3. This issue was also involved in A.Y. 2008-09 and the CIT(A)-IV,
> Ahmedabad vide order dated 14.10.2014 after considering the submission of
> the appellant which is similar to submission filed in this year, has
> confirmed the disallowance after elaborately discussing the same in

> Representative during the course of appellate proceedings and it has been
> vehemently submitted that this issue now stands covered in the favour of
> appellant."
147\. Being aggrieved by the order of Ld.CIT (A), the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
148\. Both the parties before us vehemently supported the order of authorities
below as favorable to them.
149\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee in ITA 1663/AHD/2016 vide order
dated 8-9-2017, the ITAT deleted the addition made by the TPO/AO. The relevant
extract of the order is reproduced as under:
> "132. A perusal of the order of the Co-ordinate Bench for earlier years
> shows that the Bench has considered similar issue in ITA Nos. 3297 & . A.Y.
> 2009-10 3420/Ahd/2014 and has decided this issue in favour of the assessee

> 87\. We have given a thoughtful consideration to the orders of the

> the A.O to delete the addition of Rs. 21,25,278/-. Ground no. 9 is allowed.
> 124\. Respectfully following the same, we direct the A.O. to delete the

. 125. Ground no. 12 relates to the disallowance of Rs. 62,15,78,070/- made
u/s. 37 of expenses incurred on behalf of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries.
126 An identical issue was considered by the Bench in assessee's own case in
ITA NO. 1589/Ahd/2011 and ITA No. 2430/Ahd/2009. The relevant part of ITA No.
2430/Ahd/2009 has been extracted in ground no. 11 of this appeal. For similar
reasons, we direct the A.O. to delete the disallowance of Rs. 62,15,78,070/-.
133\. Respectfully following the decisions of the Co-ordinate Bench (supra),
we decline to interfere. Ground no. 9 is dismissed.
149.1 As facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above, therefore we are inclined not to disturb the finding of the
Ld.CIT (A). Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the
own case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. It is also important to note that the ld. DR has not
brought anything on record against the finding of the ld. CIT-A, and the
argument advanced by the ld. Counsel for the assessee.
149.2 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract of the order has already been reproduced above.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By
Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun
Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 120 -
said order, we are of the considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-
ordinate bench as discussed above shall be applied in the case on hand with
full strength. The ld. DR has not brought any decisions varying from similar
or identical facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered
by the earlier order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in
line and tune with the judicial discipline and decorum. Hence the ground of
appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
150\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 10 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in directing the AO to allow weighted deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the
Act not certified by the DSIR.
150.1 At the outset, we note that we have adjudicated the issue raised by the
Revenue along with ground of appeal of the assessee's appeal in ITA
929/AHD/2017 vide ground no. 6 vide Para no. 35 of this order. Thus
respectfully, following the same, we do not find any reason to interfere in
the order of the Ld. CIT-A. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.
151\. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.
152\. Now we take up the assessee appeal in ITA No. 1237/AHD/2017 for AY
2012-13. The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 121 -
The Appellant raises the following grounds, which are mutually exclusive,
independent of and without prejudice to one another:
1\. The order passed by the Learned Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals)
[hereinafter referred to as 'the Ld. CIT(A)'] is bad in law and on facts.
1\. Re: Addition on account of Sale of Pantoprazole to Sun Pharma Global FZE
-Rs. 94,73,729/-: 
1.1 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of Assessing
Officer ('AO'}/ Transfer Pricing Officer ('TPO') who erred in rejecting the
benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract manufacturer having regard to
the functions performed, the assets deployed and risks undertaken by the
Appellant in the transaction.
The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who erred in
classifying the sales made by the Appellant having regard to the relevant Para
of the US PDA under which the approval was sought without appreciating the
fact that the US PDA Para under which the product is filed is irrelevant for
the Appellant who is a contract manufacturer.
The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in sustaining the additions made by the TPO
by recharacterizing the transaction undertaken by the appellant based on
peculiar interpretation of the past & unpredictable future events.
The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who erred in
arbitrary adoption of residual profit split method (PSM) as the same cannot be
applied to the transaction under review as neither there is any transfer of
unique intangibles nor multiple interrelated transactions requiring separate
evaluation.
Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. C!T(A) failed to appreciate that if at
all PSM is adopted as the most appropriate method, the determination of ALP
had to be in accordance with Rule 10B(1)(d)(ii) on the basis of "reliable
external market data" which was totally nonexistent, hence application of PSM
method would fail.
Without prejudice to the above, even if PSM is to be followed, the Ld. CtT(A)
has grossly erred in not appreciating that the IPR belonged to the AE, AE was
exposed to significant risks (having regard to the fact that the Para IV
product had inherent risk) and accordingly the profit allocation to the AE
ought io be high.
Without prejudice to the above, even if PSM is to be followed, the Ld. CIT(A)
grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO without appreciating the fact
that the profits of the AE derived from sale of Pantoprazole ought to be split
between the Appellant and the AE after deducting the infringement claim of USD
506 million which was discharged by AE.
Without prejudice to the above, if the PSM is to be followed, the ratio of
50:50 ought to be adopted for benchmarking sale of the product.

2\. Re: Addition on account of Sale of Para IV products other than
Pantoprazole to Sun Pharma Global FZE - Rs. 94,76,59,251/-:
2.1 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who
erred in rejecting the benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract
manufacturer having regard to the functions performed, the assets deployed and
risks undertaken by the Appellant in the transaction.
2.2 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who
erred in classifying the saies made by the Appellant having regard to the
relevant Para of the US PDA under which the approval was sought without
appreciating the fact that the US PDA Para under which the product is filed is
irrelevant for the Appellant who is a contract manufacturer.
2.3 The Ld. CIT{A) has grossly erred in sustaining the additions made by the
TPO by recharacterizing the transaction undertaken by the appellant based on
peculiar interpretation of the past & unpredictable future events.
2.4 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld, CIT{A), has grossly erred in
upholding the order of AO/TPO and further enhancing the adjustment merely by
placing reliance on the order of CIT(A) for AY 2008-09 which covered
Pantoprazole drug without appreciating the evidently distinguishable facts
relevant for other Para IV products.
2.5 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who
erred in arbitrary adoption of residual PSM as the same cannot be applied to
the transaction under review as neither there is any transfer of unique
intangibles nor multiple interrelated transactions requiring separate
evaluation, 2.6 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) failed to
appreciate that if at all PSM is adopted as the most appropriate method, the
determination of ALP had to be in accordance with Rule 10B(1)(d)(ii) on the
basis of "reliable external market data" which was totally nonexistent, hence
application of PSM method would fail.
2.7 Without prejudice to the above, even if PSM is to be followed, the Ld.
CIT(A) has grossly erred in not appreciating that the IPR belonged to the AE,
AE was exposed to significant risks (having regard to the fact that the Para
IV product had inherent risk) and accordingly the profit allocation to the AE
ought to be high.
2.8 Without prejudice to the above, even if PSM is to be followed, the Ld.
C1T(A) has grossly erred in enhancing the attribution of profits for Para IV
product (other than Pantoprazole) from 50:50 to 80:20 which having regard to
the facts of the case is unwarranted.
3\. Re: Addition on account of Sale of Non Para IV products to Sun Pharma

3.1 The Ld. C1T(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who
erred in rejecting the benchmarking done by the Appellant as a contract ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

manufacturer having regard to the functions performed, the assets deployed and
risks undertaken by the Appellant in the transaction. 3.2 The Ld. CIT(A) has
grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who erred in classifying the
sales made by the Appellant having regard to the relevant Para of the US TDA
under which the approval was sought without appreciating the fact that the US
PDA Para under which the product is filed is irrelevant for the Appellant who
is a contract manufacturer.
3.3 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in sustaining the additions made by the
TPO by recharacterizing the true nature of the transaction undertaken by the
appellant based on peculiar interpretation of the past & unpredictable future
events.
3\. Without prejudice to the above, . the Ld. CIT(A), has grossly erred in
upholding the order of AO/TPO and sustaining the additions merely by placing
reliance on the order of CIT(A) for AY 2008-09 which covered Pantoprazole drug
without appreciating the evidently distinguishable facts relevant for Non Para
IV products.
3.5 The Ld. CIT(A) has grossly erred in upholding the order of AO/TPO who
erred in arbitrary adoption of residual PSM as the same cannot be applied to
the transaction under review as neither there is any transfer of unique
intangibles nor multiple interrelated transactions requiring separate
evaluation. 3.6 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) failed to
appreciate that if at all PSM is adopted as the most appropriate method, the
determination of ALP had to be in accordance with Rule 10B(1)(d)(ii) on the
basis of "reliable external market data" which was totally nonexistent, hence
application of PSM method would fail. 3.7 Without prejudice to the above, the
Ld. CIT{A) has erred in not appreciating that the IPR rests with the AE and
the AE was exposed to significant risks inherent in the transaction and
accordingly the profit allocation for the IPR to the AE was extremely low and
unjustified.
3.8 Without prejudice to the above, if PSM is to bo followed, the ratio of
50:50 ought to be adopted for benchmarking sale of the products.
4\. Non-deduction of Remuneration received from Partnership firm for
determination of Book Profits u/s 115JB - Rs. 201,23,42,044/-: 4.1 On the
facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. CIT(A) erred in
not considering the remuneration receivable from the partnership firm as an
income to which the provisions of section 10 apply for the limited purpose of
computing book profits u/s 115JB without appreciating that remuneration
received from partnership firm is nothing but an appropriation of profit. 4.2
On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. CIT(A)
failed to appreciate that the entire mechanism of computing book profits is
based on normal commercial profits having regard to the relevant accounting
framework prescribed in Companies Act and thus remuneration is eligible to be
deducted for computing book profits as per clause (ii) to Explanation to
section 115JB (2) read with Chapter III of the Act.
4.3 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that the income not chargeable to tax by
virtue of section 28(v) under normal provisions of the Act cannot be
considered while computing book profits u/s 115JB.
4.4 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the action
of the Ld. CIT(A) in upholding the addition has resulted in double taxation of
the same ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &

income, once in the hands of the partnership firm and again in the hands of
the Appellant contrary to position expressed by the CBDT Circular No. 8/2014.
5\. Disallowance of expenditure incurred for doctors towards business
promotion - Rs. 7,56,90,473/-:
5.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) grossly erred in disallowing selling and distribution expenditure
allegedly incurred on doctors/medical practitioners without appreciating that
the same is for the promotion of the business and was in furtherance of its
business objectives and further erred in:
1 Not appreciating that the provisions of Indian Medical Council Regulations,
2002, are not applicable to the pharmaceutical companies and hence any
expenditure incurred on sales promotion would be allowed as business
expenditure u/s 37(1) being in furtherance of its business objectives. 2
Relying on the CBDT Circular No. 5/2012 while disallowing the amount of
expenditure without appreciating that department circular are not binding on
the Appellant.
5.2 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) has already upheld
disallowance of selling and distribution expenditure allegedly incurred on
behalf of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ('SPS') and Sun Pharma Sikkim ('SPS')
u/s 14A, therefore, the amount to be disallowed under this ground ought to be
reduced by the amount already disallowed under the other ground.
6\. Disallowance of expenditure incurred on repairs treating them as
expenditure - Rs, 28,93,787/-:
6.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly
erred in confirming the disallowance of expenditure incurred amounting to Rs.
28,93,787/- treating the same as capital expenditure without appreciating that
the same were incurred as part of routine repairs and maintenance and did not
result into creation of any new asset or any benefit of an enduring nature.
7\. Disallowance of selling and distribution expenditure incurred on behalf of
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ('SPl') and Pharma Sikkim ('SPS') u/s 14A: Rs.
170,95,96,941/-
7.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) erred in disallowing selling and distribution expenditure incurred by
the Appellant u/s 14A on the ground that the said expenditure is directly
incurred by the Appellant for earning exempt income without appreciating that:
.1 Selling and distribution expenditure incurred by the Appellant is wholly
and exclusively for the purposes and in furtherance of its business activities
and in absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary, it could not be
presumed to have been directly incurred for earning exempt income; .2
Remuneration received from the partnership firm is not an exempt income
covered under chapter III rather a receipt which is not liable to tax in the
hands of partner by virtue of interplay between provisions of section 28(v)

7.2 Without prejudice to the above, the selling and distribution expenditure
to be disallowed has been determined arbitrarily in the ratio of turnover
having no direct nexus with the exempt income earned by the Appellant. 7.3
Without prejudice to the above, disallowance under this ground ought to be
restricted in terms of section 14A read with clause (iii) to rule 8D(2) or
ought to be substantially reduced.
7.4 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in
disallowing the selling and distribution expenses u/s 14A without appreciating
that Ld. CIT(A) himself, has recharacterized the remuneration received by the
Appellant as royalty. The Ld. CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that if the
income was sought to be re- characterized as royalty, then the expenditure
incurred to earn such income ought to be allowed as deduction.
8\. Re: Disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D- Rs. 7,1G,20,195/- 8.1 On the
facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. CIT(A) erred in
confirming the disallowance of Rs. 7,16,20,195/- u/s 14A by invoking rule 8D
of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 without appreciating that: .1 The AO has
mechanically invoked rule 8D without first recording its satisfaction
regarding the correctness of the claim made by the Appellant; .2 The income
earned by the Appellant from the partnership firm is not an exempt income
covered under chapter III of the Act and hence section 14A could not be
invoked to that extent;
.3 Since the Appellant had sufficient interest free funds to make the
investments, presumption ought to be made that investments were made from
interest free funds and not borrowed funds;
.4 Provisions of section 14A cannot be applied to investments which are
strategic in nature or capable of generating taxable income; .5 No
disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D(2)(ii) could be made when in fact the
Appellant has earned net interest income.
8.2 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) has committed errors while
computing the disallowance under section 14A read with rule 8D.
9\. Re: Addition of expense disallowed u/s 14A for computing book profit u/s
115JB:
9.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) erred in considering the amount disallowed u/s 14A under normal
provisions, as amount to be added for computing book profit u/s 115JB without
appreciating that the provisions of section 115JB and section 14A are mutually
exclusive, deeming provisions enacted under the Income-tax Act which are to be
made operative only to the extent of the deeming fiction created therein. The
Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in importing the deeming provisions of sub-section
(2) and (3) of section 14A into Explanation to section 115JB.
9.2 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) erred in adding an amount
of Rs. 7,16,20,195/- u/s 115JB read with section HAread with rule 8D without
appreciating that:
.1 In absence of direct and specific expenditure incurred for earning exempt
income, no addition of the amount disallowed u/s 14A read with Rule 8D in
computing book profits is warranted.

.2 The Assessing Officer has mechanically invoked Rule 8D without first
recording its satisfaction regarding the correctness of the claim made by the
Appellant;
.3 The income earned by the Appellant fro:n the partnership firm is not an
exempt income covered under chapter 111 of the Act and hence section 14A could
not be invoked to that extent;
.4 Since the Appellant had sufficient interest free funds to make the
investments, presumption ought to be made that investments were made from

disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D(2){ii) could be made when in fact the
Appellant has earned net interest income.
9.3 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in not
rectifying the errors made by the AO while computing the amount of
disallowance under section 14A read with rule.8D.
10\. Disallowance of R&D expenses (revenue) allegedly incurred on behalf of
partnership firms of SPI and SPS - Rs.117,70,04,468/-: 10.1 On the facts and
in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. CIT{A) grossly erred in
allocating R&D expense (revenue) incurred by the Appellant to the partnership
firms of SPI and SPS without appreciating that: .1 The Appellant had carried
out the R&D as part of its own business activities and that all the IPRs
arising out of the said R&D activity remained with the Appellant;
.2 The decision to manufacture the products at the factory of SPI and SPS was
based on business and commercial expediency and in pursuance of the obligation
on the Appellant under the partnership deed in lieu of which it was entitled
to receive remuneration;
.3 The Appellant being a working partner was obliged to provide technical and
other information to partnership firm and hence the incurrence of R&D
(revenue) expenses, if any, was in furtherance of its obligation under the
partnership deed and therefore, allowable u/s 37(1). 10.2 Without prejudice to
the above, the Ld. CIT (A) grossly erred in allocating proportionate R&D
expenditure incurred to SPI and SPS without appreciating that the deduction on
account of R&D expenses claimed by the Appellant was in accordance with
provisions of section 35(2AB) and the same did not require the expenditure to
be expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of business.
10.3 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT{A) grossly erred in exceeding
its jurisdiction in making the said disallowance without appreciating that
specific powers were granted to DSIR in this regard and the fact that
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) has already approved
the entire revenue expenditure.
10.4 Without prejudice to the above, Assessing Officer has undisputedly
accepted that R&D expenses are futuristic in nature, and under such
circumstances, R&D expenditure incurred during the year under consideration
cannot be associated to the turnover of the said assessment year for the
purpose of disallowance.

10.5 Without prejudice to the above, the Assessing Officer grossly erred in
allocating total R&D cost incurred by the Appellant in the ratio of domestic
formulations turnover without appreciating that only cost of raw materials
consumed shall be allocated between the Appellant and the partnership firm, as
held by the Honorable ITAT for AY 2005-06, 2004-05 and 2002-03. 10.6 Without
prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in not accepting the
segment wise expenditure incurred by the domestic formulation department
amounting to Rs 3053.29 Lakhs and ought to have disallowed the R & D expenses
only relating to the domestic formulation activity. 10.7 Without prejudice to
the above, the R&D expense should not be allocated on the basis of domestic
formulation turnover as both the entities operate in different market segments
with different underlying facts. 10.8 Without prejudice to the above, the
disallowance of the R&D expenditure should be restricted only , a part of the
actual amount incurred by the Appellant on the products that are manufactured
by the partnership firms (i.e., SPI and SPS).
10.9 Without prejudice to the above, and without accepting any disallowance of
the expenses, the Assessing Officer should have restricted the disallowance
towards expenses as provided u/s 14A read with Rule 8D and that no further
disallowance was then warranted.
10.10 Without prejudice to the above, the amount of disallowance ought to be
substantially reduced.
11\. Re: Disallowance of R&D expenses (capital) allegedly incurred on behalf
of SPI and SPS-Rs.17,71,22,520/-:
11.1 The Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in allocating capital R&D expenditure
amounting to Rs. 17,71,22,520/- incurred by the Appellant to SPS and SPI on
the ground that the Appellant had incurred R&D expenses for and on behalf of
SPS and SPI without appreciating that the assets acquired were actually owned
by the Appellant and used for conducting R&D activities in the Appellant's
facilities which were approved by the DSIR and this is also duly certified by
the statutory auditors of the Appellant Company. 11.2 The Ld. CIT(A) failed to
appreciate the fact that capital expenditure was solely for the benefit of
Appellant and ownership of all products and facilities was exclusively with
the Appellant and not SPS and SPI. 11.3 The CIT(A) grossly erred in
disallowing the expenditure incurred by the Appellant on the capital assets
without appreciating that the said deduction was allowable by virtue of the
enabling provisions of section 35{2AB) and 35(1 )(iv) and the Appellant had
fulfilled all the conditions relating to section 35(2AB) and 35(1)(iv) and
hence there could not have been any allocation of R&D expenditure to SPI and
SPS.
11.44 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in
exceeding its jurisdiction in confirming the said disallowance without
appreciating that specific powers were granted to DSIR and hence the Assessing
Officer / CIT(A) could not have disallowed the same.
11.5 Without prejudice to the above, CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that as
per the partnership deed, the Appellant, being the working partner was obliged
to provide technical and other information to partnership firm in lieu of ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

which it was entitled to receive remuneration and hence the utilization of the
capital R&D equipment for the activities of the partnership firm, if any, was
only in the furtherance of its obligation under the partnership deed. 11.6
Without prejudice to the above and without accepting any disallowance of the
expenses, the Ld. CIT(A) should have restricted the disallowance towards
expenses as provided u/s 14A read with Rule 8D.
12\. Addition on account of re-characterizing remuneration from SPI and SPS
(partnership firms) as consideration for use of Trademarks, Brands etc. - Rs
201,23,42,044/-:
12.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) grossly erred in upholding the recharacterization of the remuneration
received from the partnership firms, which is not taxable by virtue of the
proviso to section 28(v) read with section 40{b) of the Act. In doing so, the
Ld. CIT(A) erred in arbitrarily re-characterizing the receipt of partner's
remuneration as royalty holding it to be a consideration for use of brand name
and trade mark of the Appellant by the partnership firm which allegations are
based on mere surmises and conjectures disregarding the actual terms of the
partnership deed entered into by the Appellant. 12.2 The Ld. CIT(A) failed to
appreciate that-
> .1 That there is no provision under Act which permits the Income-tax
> Authorities to recharacterize any transaction or to change the nature of
> income earned by the Appellant;
> .2 That contractual agreements entered into by appellant cannot be rewritten
> unless there is any illegality or infirmity in the contractual agreement;
> .3 The remuneration was paid to the Appellant in accordance with the terms
> of the partnership deed and in lieu of the services and functions rendered
> in its capacity as working partner of the Firm; .4 That addition of royalty
> income on account of use of trademark and brand name is on notional basis
> and was never realized by the Appellant;
12.3 Without prejudice to the above contention, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred
in upholding the allegations that the transaction with SPI was entered into
with a motive to avoid tax as SPI was entitled to deduction u/s 80IB without
appreciating the fact that deduction claimed by SPI u/s 80IB was limited to
only 25% percent of profits earned and that SPI continued to pay tax on the
balance income.
12.4 Without prejudice to the above, the order of the CIT{A) for AY 2008-09,
the very basis on which the Ld. CIT{A) / AO has relied, has been rendered
inexistent. The Hon'ble C!T(A) while adjudicating for AY 2008-09 in
Appellant's case had in turn relied on the decision of the Hon'ble CIT(A) in
case of SPI for AY 2008-09. However, the Hon'ble Amritsar ITAT in case of SPI
has decided the case in favour of the Appellant and hence no addition on
account of re-characterization of remuneration on this basis can be held
tenable.
12.5 Without prejudice to the above contention that the said receipt is not
royalty income, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in not allowing the selling and
distribution and other expenditure incurred by the Appellant on behalf of SPI
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

/ SPS without appreciating that the same was incurred for earning royalty
income and hence, ought to allowed as a deduction from royalty income. 12.6
Without Prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that
only Rs. 86,63,96,134/- being remuneration from SPS accruing in the current
year should have been considered and remuneration of Rs. 96,27,96,704/-
pertaining to past years cannot be included for the purpose of computing
disallowance under this ground.
12.7 Without prejudice to the above and without admitting that the
remuneration amounts to royalty, the Ld. CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that
in any case, the entire remuneration cannot be held to be received for
permitting use of trademarks, brand name but is for a wide range of functions
/ services performed by the Appellant in its capacity as working partner.
13\. Re: Disallowance of R&D Expense not approved by DSIR of Rs.
36,93,69,000/-:
13.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) grossly erred in setting aside the issue to the AO on the ground that
details of the expenses have not been furnished whereas in fact the relevant
details have been duly submitted to the AO as well as the Ld. CIT{A) as part
of the paperback.
14\. Taxability of interest on Income Tax Refund u/s 244A - Rs. 5,99,53,963/-:
14.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) grossly erred in upholding the addition on account of interest on
income tax refund.
14.2 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in not
restricting the amount of addition to Rs. 3,62,78,819/- being the amount of
interest on income tax refund granted to ;he Appellant.
14.3 Without prejudice to the above, the Ld. CIT(A) grossly erred in taxing
Rs.
3,62,78,819/-without appreciating that the same have been offered to tax in in
AY 2015-16 and AY 2016-17 respectively.
15\. Non-granting of relief u/s 10(15) on Interest on tax free bonds wrongly
offered to tax-Rs. 99,93,951/-
15.1 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CIT(A) grossly erred in not granting relief u/s 10(15) on interest income
received in respect of tax free bonds and taxing it as taxable which is
otherwise exempt under the provisions of the Act thereby not considering the
CBDT Circular No. 14 (XL-35) dated 11.04.1955."
153\. The 1st issue raised by the assessee is that ld. CIT (A) erred in
confirming the addition made by the AO/TPO for Rs. 94,73,729/- on account of

the Ld.CIT (A). Accordingly, we direct the AO to delete the addition made by
him. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
154\. The issue raised in the ground no. 2 and 3 are related to the addition
made by the TPO for Rs. 94,76,59,251 and 107,77,95,776.00 respectively on
account of sale of drugs other than pantoprazole to SPG BVI and SPG FZE.

155\. The next issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 4 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in not allowing deduction of the remuneration received from the
partnership firms while determining the books profit under section 115JB of
the Act.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

155.1 We have already decided the impugned issue against the assessee in ITA
929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 8 vide Para No. 56 & 57 of
this order. Thus respectfully following the same, the ground of appeal of the
assessee is dismissed.
156\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground no. 5 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in not allowing the deduction of Rs. 7,56,90,473/- on account of
expenditure incurred for doctors towards business promotion.
156.1 The assessee has shown Rs. 2424.3 million on account of selling &
distribution expenses which includes Rs. 8,41,89,667/- on account of the
distribution of gifts and providing hospitality services to the doctors/
medical practitioners.
156.2 However, the AO was of the view that the said expenditure is prohibited
under the guidelines issued by the medical council of India (MCI). Therefore
the same is not allowable under section 37(1) of the Act.
156.3 However, the assessee submitted the breakup of Rs. 8,41,89,667/- as
under:
           Sr.No.   Particulars                 Amount
           1.       Business    Promotion       7,27,99,029/-

                     Total                       8,41,89,667/-
156.4 The assessee further contended that such expenses were incurred to gain
regular development in the medical field and valuable inputs in the form of
feedback from doctors. The company considers medical fraternity a very
important partner in the overall drug development to retain its leadership
position in the industry.
156.5 Assessee further submitted that it had provided Clinical/hospital pieces
of equipment to medical practitioner amounting to Rs. 7,27,99,029/- with a
view to have the brand value of its business. These pieces of equipment help
the doctor to provide better services and early detection of diseases.
156.6 The assessee further submitted that it has incurred conference fee &
sponsorship expenses amounting to Rs. 84,99,194/- by way of the reimbursement
of fees for conference, seminars, and sponsorship. The doctors gain knowledge
about the various disease which is shared with the assessee. The doctors also
provide feedback which helps the assessee to improve/develop its product and
research and development.
156.7 The assessee has also reimbursed the accommodation expenses to the
doctors amounting to Rs. 28,91,444/- which is incurred by the doctors for
their stay to attend the conference and seminars.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 133 -
156.8 The assessee also submitted that IMC regulation does not apply to it as
assessee is a pharmaceutical company and not a medical practitioner.
156.9 The assessee also contended that circular issued by the CBDT bearing no.
5/2012 does not apply to it as held in various judicial pronouncements.
157\. However, AO disregarded the contention of the assessee and held that MCI
is a statutory body which discharges its function under the Medical Council
Act 1956\. Therefore any violation of the guidelines would be covered under
the prohibition of law as mentioned in explanation 1 to section 37(1).
157.1 Further, CBDT also in this regard issued circular No. 5/2012 dated
1-8-2012 which highlight that any expense incurred in the nature of freebees
to a medical practitioner is to be disallowed. Accordingly, the AO disallowed
the sum of Rs. 8,41,89,667/- and added to the total income of the assessee.
158\. Aggrieved assessee carried the matter to Ld. CIT (A) who partly
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> 23.2 I have careful considered the facts on record and submission of the
> ''Ld. Authorized Representative. Admittedly, the appellant has incurred
> expenditure of Rs.8,41,89,667/- as detailed above on gift and reimbursement
> of lodging and boarding and conference expenses incurred / by the

> 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 134 -
As is evident from the written \ submission, the business promotion expenses
of Rs.7,27,99,029/-are pertaining to the equipment provided to various medical
j practitioners as gifts. Claim of indirect business gain as a result of
gifts/ provided to the medical practitioners is irrelevant for alfowabifity of
these expenses. The appellant has also argued that the amendment to Indian
Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette & Ethics) Regulation 2002 on
10.12.2009 and CBDT Circular No. 5/2012 dated 01.08.2012 are not applicable in
the case of appellant since they are applicable to the Doctors/ Medical
Practitioners accepting freebies.. This argument of Ld. Authorized
Representative is also not acceptable. Undisputedly, Medical Council of India
has amended Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and
Ethics) Regulations 2002 with effect from 10.12.2009 prohibiting from
accepting of gifts, travel facility or hospitality, from any pharmaceutical
company or the health care industry by the doctors/medical professionals. Thus
regulation is issued by the statutory body created under the Act of Parliament
i.e. Medical Council Act, 1956. CBDT has also Issued a Circular No. 5 of 2012
in this regard stating that expenditure on freebies given to medical
professionals and their professional associations in violation of the
regulation issued by the Medical Council of India which is a regulatory body
constituted under Medical Council Act, 1956, will not be allowed as
expenditure in view of the Explanation below section 37(1). The validity of
this circular is also been upheld by the Hon'ble High Court of Himachai
Pradesh vide order dated 26.12.2012 in CWP No. 10793 of 2012. Since Medical
Council of India has prohibited expenditure on freebies given to the medical
professional with effect from 10,12.2009, in my considered view, the Circular
No. 5 of CBDT dated 01.08.2012 only reasserts the legal position and hence the
expenditure on freebies will not be allowable u/s. 37(1) being an expenditure
prohibited by law. Accordingly, I hold that expenditure on gifts to the-extent
of Rs.7,27,99,029/- shall not be deemed to have been incurred for the purposes
of business or profession and hence the disallowance to this extent is
confirmed.
23.2.1. As regards the balance expenditure on Accommodation (Lodging &
Boarding) at Rs.28,91,444/- and Conference fees and sponsorship at
Rs.84,99,194/-, the appellant has submitted that these expenses pertained to
reimbursement of accommodation expenses to the Doctors and medical "
practitioner during their stay to attend the conference and seminars ,
organized in furtherance of business objections of upgrading the medical !
knowledge. Similarly, conference fees and sponsorship has been also stated to
be reimbursement of fees for conference and seminars held in India and abroad.
It has further been claimed that conference and seminars were organized to
gain the knowledge by the medical practitioner which is, then shared with the
appellant for improving the product quality and Research and Development. From
the submission of appellant itself, it is crystal clear that the reimbursement
of accommodation expenses have directly benefited the medical practitioner and
Doctor and hence the same is in the nature of gift hit by Circular No. 5/2012
and amended guidelines of Medical Council of India. Accordingly, I hold that
accommodation expenses at Rs.28,91,444/- are also deserves to be disallowed
being freebies. The conference fees and sponsorship expenses since were
incurred for sharing the knowledge in the medical field which may help in
improving the product and Research and Development activity of (appellant, in
my considered ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT
Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 135 -
view, it is not hit by the Circular No. 5/2012 and amended MCI Guidelines.
Further they appears to be in the nature of remuneration for services rendered
by the Medical Professionals in the conference and seminars. Accordingly, the
disallowance to the extent .of Rs.84,99,194/- being conference fees and
sponsorship is directed to be deleted and balance amount of disallowance is
confirmed. Thus, appellant succeeds partly in respect of Ground No. 20.
159\. Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.CIT (A), both the assessee and
Revenue are in appeal before us.
The revenue has raised the following ground of appeal:
1\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the AO. to the disallowance to the
extent of Rs.84,99,194/- being conference fees and sponsorship, without
appreciating that the A.O, had correctly disallowed the expenses on conference
fees and sponsorship, since the said expenses incurred by the assessee were in
the nature of freebies/gift to the medical practineers, thereby assessee had
violated the Regulations laid down by Medical Council of India.
160\. The ld. AR and the DR before us relied on the order of authorities below
as favorable to them.
161\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on records. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the case of Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. DCIT reported in
85 taxmann.com 354the Hon'ble Ahmedabad Tribunal deleted the addition made by
the TPO/AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced as under:

161.2 The facts of the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above. Therefore respectfully following the same, we allow the
ground of appeal of the assessee and dismiss the ground of appeal of the
Revenue.
162\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 6 is that the Ld.
CIT-A erred in treating the repairing expenditure of Rs. 28,93,787/- as
capital in nature.
162.1 We have already decided the impugned issue in favor of the Revenue in
ITA 929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 10 vide Para No. 72 & 73
of this order. Thus respectfully following the same, the ground of appeal of
the assessee is dismissed.
163\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 7 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in making the addition for selling and distribution ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13

expenses amounting to Rs. 1,70,95,96,941/- incurred on behalf of SPI and SPS
u/s 14A of the Act.
163.1 We have already decided the impugned issues by restoring the appeal to
the file of the AO in ITA 929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 13
vide Para No. 95 & 96 of this order. Thus respectfully following the same, the
ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purpose.
164\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 8 is that the Ld.
CIT-A erred in confirming the addition made by the AO u/s 14A of the Act.
164.1 We have already decided the impugned issues by restoring the appeal to
the file of the AO in ITA 929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 11
vide Para No. 80 & 81 of this order. Thus respectfully following the same, the
ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purpose.
165\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground of 9 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in confirming the addition made by AO for the expenses u/s 14A of
the Act while computing the book profit u/s 115JB of the Act.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11

165.1 We have already decided the impugned issue in favor of the assessee in
ITA 929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 12 vide Para No. 88 & 89
of this order. Thus we direct the AO accordingly to delete the addition of
expenses disallowed u/s 14A while computing the book profit u/s 115JB of the
Act. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
166\. The issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 10 and 11 is that the
Ld.CIT (A) erred in confirming the order of the AO by allocating the research
and development expenses incurred by it to the other partnership firms and
accordingly made the disallowance of such expenses proportionately 166.1 We
have already decided the impugned issue in favor of the assessee in ITA
929/AHD/2017 in the ground of appeal bearing no. 7 vide Para No. 64 & 65 of
this order. Thus we direct the AO accordingly to delete the addition made by
him. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
167\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground no. 12 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in confirming the addition made by the AO amounting to Rs.
2,01,23,42,044/- on account of remuneration received by the assessee from
partnership firms treated as fees for the use of trademarks and brands.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 139 -
167.1 The assessee in the year under consideration has received remuneration
from the partnership firm namely SPI amounting to Rs. 18,31,49,206/- and from
SPS amounting to Rs. 1,82,91,92,838/-which has been reduced in computing the
taxable profit under the normal provision of the Act. The assessee claimed
that the remuneration paid to it by the firm was not allowed as a deduction in
the hands of the partnership as mentioned earlier.
167.2 Accordingly, the assessee claimed that such remuneration is not taxable
in its hands as per proviso to section 28(v) r.w.s. 40(b) of the Act.
168\. However, the AO disregard the contention of the assessee by observing
that the Ld. CIT (A) in its case for AY 2008-09 in similar facts and
circumstances treated the remuneration as taxable income by holding that
remuneration was nothing, but it was fee for the use of all present and future
trademark/brands and technology of the partnership firms. Therefore the AO
took a similar view in the year under consideration and treated the
remuneration as taxable income amounting to Rs. 2,01,23,42,044/- and added to
the total income of the assessee.
169\. Aggrieved assessee carried the matter to Ld. CIT (A) who confirmed the
order of the AO by observing as under:
> 21.1. As per the existing Agreement, the appellant company has permitted
> user of trademark/brands by SPI/SPS for a token consideration of Rs.1/- for
> the period of 5 years. The Assessing Officer, in the assessment order of SPI
> has discussed this issue and he has valued the royalty of Jammu and Dadra
> plant at a substantial sum, and ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and
> ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
> Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 140 -
> consequently has reworked out the eligible deduction u/s. 80IB. It has been
> also noticed that the SPI has not paid any management fees to the appellant
> I company although three of its Directors and Key Management personnel |
> viz. Shri Dilip Sanghvi, Shri Sudhir Valia and Shri Shailesh Desai, have
> been i looking after the business of appellant as well as SPI/SPS.
> Accordingly, the I management fees for Jammu & Dadra and Sikkim units,
> respectively, was | estimated and accordingly was reduced from the profit of
> SPI/SPS for computation of deduction u/s. SGlBj-.w.s, 80IB(13). As a matter
> of fact, the appellant has not charged any royalty from SPI/SPS for allowing
> use off | various trademark/brands and technology. A copy of Trademark
> license/user Agreement dated 10.04.2003 between the appellant and SPI was
> collected and examined during the course of appellate proceedings for A.Y.
> 2008-09 by the CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad. After considering the terms of the
> agreement, it has been held in A.Y. 2008-09 that the so called
> "remuneration" was nothing but it was fee for permitting use of all present
> and future trademark/brands and technology to SPI. The relevant findings are
> recorded by the CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad in this regard in paras-20.5 to 20.5.1.
> Following the order of CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad and also considering the factual
> and legal position in this regard, in A.Y. 2009-10, I also held that the
> appellant company had received a sum of Rs.57,49,50,297/- from SPI as
> consideration for permitting use of all present and future trademark/brands,
> in the entire world/ for the period of 5 years and for providing other
> managerial services. Thus, the so called "remuneration" as claimed by the
> appellant does not represent the remuneration at all but fee for above
> mentioned services and accordingly income was enhanced by Rs.57,49,50,297/-.
> The business arrangements of appellant with SPS firm are identical to SPI.
> 21.2. Since the facts are identical in this year also, I respectfully
> following the order of CIT(A)-IV, Ahmedabad in A.Y. 2008-9 and my own order
> in A.Y.2009-10, hold that Assessing Officer is justified in treating the
> remuneration of Rs.201,23,42,044/- as consideration received for use of
> trademark/brands and accordingly assessing the same under normal provisions
> of the Act. Thus Ground No. 18 is dismissed.
170\. Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.CIT (A) assessee is in appeal
before us:
171\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances this ITAT in the own case of the assessee bearing ITA No.
1666/AHD/2016 for the AY 2009-10 vide order dated 08-09-2017 has deleted the
addition made by the AO. Therefore there is no question for making the
addition to the total income.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 141 -
172\. On the other hand the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of the Lowe
Authorities.
173\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on records. At the outset, we find that in the identical facts and
circumstances in the own case of the assessee's (supra), the ITAT deleted the
addition made by the AO. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced as
under:
> 72.This issue was considered by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 3297 &
> 3420/Ahd/2014 vide ground no. 13 of that appeal and the relevant findings of
> the Tribunal read as under:-
> 128\. We have given a thoughtful consideration to the facts in issue. It is
> an undisputed fact that the remuneration has been paid by the firm SPI as
> per the partnership deed read with supplementary partnership deed. It is
> also an undisputed fact that the said partnership deed read with
> supplementary deed has not been treated as sham or unlawful deeds. The First
> Appellate Authority emphasized on the entire transaction as a device of tax
> evasion. The partnership firm SPI has claimed Rs. 40.12 crores as
> remuneration to the assessee company but at the same time, it did not claim
> the same as deduction as it was not paid to a whole time partner as provided
> in the Act. It is true that the appellant company has also not offered the
> same for taxation taking a shelter behind the provisions of Section 28(v) of
> the Act. No doubt, the profits of the partnership firm are exempt u/s.
> 80IB(4) of the Act. Even, if the partnership firm had not charged Rs. 40.12
> crores as remuneration to the appellant company, the profits of the firm
> would have increased by this amount. Since the assessee is holding 97.5%
> share in the profits of the partnership firm, this amount of 40.12 crores
> would have otherwise come to the assessee in the firm of share of profit
> which again is exempt from taxation u/s. 10(2A) of the Act. Therefore, in
> our considered opinion, the allegation that it is a case of tax evasion is

> characterized as royalty in earlier assessment years and the action of the
> First Appellate Authority in the year under consideration is nothing but
> based upon assumptions and presumptions. No addition can be sustained which
> are based upon assumptions, surmises or conjectures. We, therefore, set

> amount of Rs. 40.12 crores re-characterized by the First Appellate
> Authority. Ground no. 13 is allowed.
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By

173.1 As the facts in the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case
as discussed above, therefore respectfully following the same we set aside the
order of ld. CIT-A. Accordingly, we direct the AO to delete the addition made
by him. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed.
173.2 Moreover, we are bound to follow the order of this Tribunal in the own
case of the assessee in the earlier year as the facts are identical in the
impugned issue before us. Therefore respectfully following the same we delete
the addition made the AO.
173.3 We also place our reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court
in the case of CIT v. L.G. Ramamurthi 1977 CTR (Mad.) 416 : [1977] 110 ITR 453
(Mad.). The relevant extract has been reproduced in the preceding paragraph.
In the light of the ratio decidendi in the above-said judgment, we are of the
considered opinion that the view adopted by the co-ordinate bench as discussed
above shall be applied in the case on hand with full strength. The ld. DR and
the ld. AR has not brought any decisions varying from similar or identical
facts or circumstances. Therefore, the ratio decidendi rendered by the earlier
order of the Tribunal has necessarily to be followed by us in line and tune
with the judicial discipline and decorum. In view of the above and ITA Nos.922
& 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee)
DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 143 -
respectfully following the ITAT order as discussed above, the ground of appeal
of the assessee is allowed.
174\. The issue raised in the ground no. 13 is that the Ld.CIT (A) erred in
not allowing the deduction of R&D expenses not approved by the DSIR amounting
to Rs. 36,93,69,000/-
174.1 Assessee has shown Rs. 18959.69 lacs (16,558.41 as revenue expenditure
and Rs. 2401.28 as capital expenditure excluding land & building) on account
of research and development expenses in house research facility. The assessee
on these expenses has claimed weighted deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the Act
amounting to Rs. 37919.39/-. However the AO found that the Department of
Scientific and Industrial research (for short DSIR) approved the amount of Rs.
2313.05 as capital expenditure and Rs. 14599.65 as revenue expenditure
totaling to Rs. 16,971.70 lacs (excluding land and building) in the form 3CL
dated 11- 07-2014 issued by it. Accordingly, the AO issued the notice to
assessee to reconcile the excess deduction claimed by it u/s 35(2AB) of the
Act.
174.2 The assessee in compliance to it submitted the detail of deduction
claimed by the assessee on revenue expenditure as well as capital expenditure

submission of the assessee can be categorized as under:

amounting to Rs. 20.92 lacs and Rs. 230.83 lacs respectively. The assessee
required to take approval from various authorities e.g. US FDA, ANDA, etc, for

repair and maintenance etc, amounting to Rs.100.15 lacs detailed as under:
          Sr.No.   Particulars            Amount
          1.       Repairs on Bilding     88.20
          2.       Painting Building      7.93
          3.       Munciupal Taces        33.39

                   Total                  143.6
The assessee in response to the notice issued by the AO explained that the
word "expenditure in the nature of cost of any land or building" used in
section 35(2AB) of the Act relates to the purchase of any land or building.
But the expenses claimed by it are in the nature of wear & tear expenses which
are not capital in nature for the land or building. Therefore the repair and
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 147 -
maintenance charges cannot be considered as the cost of the building. These
expenses were incurred for wear & tear and maintenance of the building. These
expenses are not bringing the building into existence or to put to use for
work. Therefore expenses are not in the nature of capital.
Repair of building expenses incurred for the building in which the research
and development activity carried out. Therefore expeses are eligible for
deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the Act.
3) During the year under consideration the assessee has incurred the expenses
towards clinical trial activity carried outside the approved facilities and in
the overseas countries amounting to Rs. 511.33 lacs as detailed under:

                facility
       2.       Overseas Clinical Trails            307.28
                Total                               511.33
Assessee further submitted that the clinical trial is an integral part of the
R&D activity. The products on which the R&D activities carried out in the
approved R&D facility of the company are subject to further trial on humans
for bio-equivalent etc, which are done on volunteers who are the patient of
the disease for which medicines are developed. The ld. CIT-A allowed the
weighted ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT
Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 148 -
deduction in respect to similar expenditure in the AY 2008-09 u/s 35(2AB) of
the Act.
4) The assessee has incurred expenses amounting to Rs. 102.55 lacs for
providing facility to employees during the year under consideration. The
details of such expenses stand under:
       Sr.No.   Particulars                        Amount
       1.       Staff Canteen                      75.10
       2.       Laundry & Cleaning                 10.80
       3.       Training Centre Expenses           0.01

                Total                              102.55
These expenses are in the nature welfare of employees who are working in the
approve R&D facility. All these facility provided by the company to it
employees to retain them and for better productivity of employees.
5) The assessee has incurred the advertisement expense amounting to Rs. 1.71
lacs on which it claimed deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the Act. Such advertisement
expenses paid by the Tandalja R&D unit to find out volunteers for the purpose
of carrying out clinical trial which is integral part of the R&D activities.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 149 -
6) The assessee has incurred expenses towards foreign professional fees
amounting to Rs. 719.61 lacs. The professional fees incurred by the assessee
for getting the advice relating to patents, violation or infringement on the
existing patent of various pharmaceutical product.
7) The assessee has incurred contract labour charges during the year under
consideration amounting to Rs. 219.81 lacs and claimed weighted deduction u/s
35(2AB) of the Act for Rs. 439.62 lacs. These payments made to contractors who
provide the employee on temporary basis. This payment is equal to salary
payment made to employee. There the same is eligible for deduction.
8) The assessee has incurred capital expenses towards purchase vehicle
amounting to Rs. 96.63 lacs during the year under consideration. Such vehicles
are used for the transportation of the employee of the R&D unit. These
expenses are integral part of the R&D activity.
175\. However the AO disregarded the contention of the assessee by observing
that as per provision of 35(2AB) only expenses approved by the DSIR eligible
for weighted deduction. Therefore expenses not approved by the DSIR are not
eligible for weighted deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the Act. The facts of the case
law i.e., M/s Claris life-science ltd relied by the assessee are not
applicable on the facts of the assessee. Similarly, the issue involved in the
case of Torrent Pharmaceuticals, its ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue)
and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 150 -
decision is not yet settled. Thus excess deduction claimed by the assessee
amounting to Rs. 3,693.69 lacs is disallowed and added to total income of the
assessee.
176\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal before the Ld.CIT (A). The
assessee before the Ld.CIT (A) has submitted that as per provision of section
35(2AB) of the Act for claiming weighted deduction only one condition i.e.
facility used for the purpose of R&D activities should be approved by
prescribed authority, is required to be complied. The assessee in support of
its contention relied on the judgment of the Torrent pharmaceuticals ltd in
ITA no 4343 & 4356/Ahd/2007 and also relied on the judgment of Hon'ble GHC in
case of Claris life science ltd reported in 326 ITR 251
177\. The Ld. CIT (A) after considering the submission made by the assessee,
party allowed the appeal of the assessee by observing as under:
1) The facts in the judgment of Hon'ble GHC in case of Claris life science ltd
reported in 326 ITR 251 is different from the case on hand.
2) The similar issue was decided by his predecessor in assessee own case for
AY 2008-09 wherein the Ld.CIT (A) after placing reliance on the judgment of
torrent pharmaceuticals ltd ITA no 4343 & 4356/Ahd/2007 held that R&D expenses
incurred by the assessee on in house research cannot be disallowed merely on
the ground that such expenses are not reported in certificate of DSIR.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 151 -
3) Accordingly the AO was directed that the expense not certified by the DSIR
should be examined individually whether expenses pertain to in house R&D
facility.
4) The building maintenance, municipal tax paid, and rent pertaining to
building exclusively used for the purpose of R&D activity are eligible for the
deduction.
178\. Being aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT-A, both the assessee and
Revenue are in appeal before us. The assessee is in appeal before us against
the direction of the ld. CIT-A for the verification of the expenses and the
Revenue is in appeal before us against the direction of the ld. CIT-A to allow
the relief to the assessee after the verification of the expenses.
179\. The Revenue before us has raised the following grounds of appeal:

180\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances this ITAT in the own case of the assessee bearing ITA No. 3297
/Ahd 2014 for the AY 2008-09 vide order dated 16-06-2017 has deleted the
addition made by the AO. Therefore there is no question for making the
addition to the total income.
181\. The Ld. AR before us also submitted that in the identical facts and
circumstances this ITAT in the case of Torrent pharmaceuticals ltd bearing ITA
No. 4343 & 4356/Ahd/2007 for the AY 2002-03 vide order dated 31-01-2011 has
deleted the addition made by the AO. Therefore there is no question for making
the addition to the total income.
182\. Both the ld. AR and the DR before us relied on the order of authorities
below as favorable to them.
183\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. At the outset, we note that the ITA Nos.922 &
1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT
vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 153 -
ld. CIT-A allowed the ground of the assessee for statistical purpose after
having reliance of the order of his predecessor for the AY 2008-09. We further
note that the assessee against the order of the Ld. CIT-A preferred an appeal
before the Tribunal in ITA No. 3297/AHD/2014 which was decided in favor of the
assessee vide order dated 16-6-2017. The relevant extract is reproduced below.
93\. As demonstrated elsewhere, the IPR/ANDA rights were very much with SPG
BVI who entered into an agreement with the appellant company for the
manufacturing of the said drug. The application of Transactiona!- Net Margin
Method is the most appropriate method in such sale transaction and has been
benchmarked by the assessee by showing it to be higher than the margin earned
from the sales made to Eli Lily.
94 .Considering the facts in totality in the light of the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V.
(supra) and on conspectus understanding of the facts as ^discussed elsewhere,
we do not find any merit in the findings of the First Appellate Authority in
accepting the application of PSM as the MAM , in our understanding of the
facts TNMM is the MAM on the given facts and the same is accepted as :h. We
set aside the findings of the Id. CIT(A) and direct to delete the f petition
of Rs. 612,03,39,468/-. Ground no. 5 of the assesse is allowed.
95\. Ground no. 6 relates to the denial of weighted deduction u/s. 35(2:A&) on
trade mark charges, overseas product registration charges.
96\. An identical issue was considered by the Bench in assessee's own case in
ITA Nos. 2076 & 2067/Ahd/2013 wherein the Bench has followed the findings of
the Co-ordinate Bench in ITA No. 1589/Ahd/2011 and the same reads as under:-
34\. We find that an identical issue was considered by the Co-ordinate Bench
in assessee's own case in ITA No. 1589/Ahd/2011 qua ground no.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 154 -
3 wherein the Bench has followed its earlier decision in ITA No.2430/Ahd/2009.
The findings thereon read as under:- Ground no. 4 relates to the disallowance
of trade mark registration an do verse as product registration charges u/s.
35(2AB).
11\. On perusing the details of R & D expenditure, the A.O found that the
assessee has claimed weighted deduction @ 150% on
(a) Trade Mark Registration Charges 2,42,S6,296/
(b) Overseas Product Registration Charges : 2,00,00,508/-
12\. The assessee was asked to justify its claim. Assessee filed a detailed
reply justifying its claim of weighted deduction. It was explained that the
expenditure incurred for product registration although named as Product
Registration Expenditure is not merely an expenditure for registration of the
product, but in large measure constitutes expenditure for validation and
confirmation of the Research carried out The A.O did not accept the claim of
the assessee holding that these expenses were incurred for registration of
drug patents in foreign countries. The A.O accordingly withdrew the weighted
deduction and allowed only 100% of the same as revenue
13\. Assessee carried the matter before the Id. CIT(A) but without any
success. While dismissing the grievance of the assessee, the Id. CIT(A)
followed the findings of his predecessor given in A. Y. 2002-03 to 2004-
05\. Before us, the Id. counsel for the assessee stated that the Tribunal in
assessee's own case in earlier years has decided this issue in favour of the
assessee and against the revenue in ITA No. 1558/Ahd/2006. The Id. D.R, could
not bring any distinguishing decision in favour of the reven ue.
14\. We have given a thoughtful consideration to the order of the Tribunal in
earlier years; we find that the Tribunal while deciding the issue in favour of
the assessee has followed the decision of the Co- ordinate Bench, Mumbai in
the case of USV Ltd. 54 SOT 615. Findings of the Tribunal read as under:-
24\. We have carefully perused the orders of the authorities below. We find
that the Id. CIT(A) has simply followed the findings of his predecessor for
A.Y. 2000-01. We also find that the assessment order for A. Y. 2000-01 has
been quashed by the Tribunal vide a ITA Nos.
ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 155 -
1199 & 1279/Ahd/2006, which means that the basis for upholding the
disallowance has been removed. We further find that on identical set of facts,
the Mumbai Bench in the case of USV Ltd. (supra) has allowed the .claim of the
assessee in respect of expenditure incurred in respect of patent application.
Respectfully, following the findings of the co- ordinate Bench (supra); we
direct the A.O to delete the disallowance of Rs.44,71,906/- Ground no. 10 is
accordingly allowed. ,
15\. Respectfully following the detailed findings given, we direct the A.O to
allow the impugned weighted deduction. Ground no. 3 is accordingly allowed.
35,We direct accordingly. Ground no. 6 is allowed.
97\. Respectfully following the same, we direct accordingly. Ground ho. 6 is
allowed.
98.6round no. 7 relates to the denial of weighted deduction u/s. 35{2AB) on
expenses incurred on Corporate Advertisement.
99.The issue is identical to the issues raised vide ground no. 6 (supra). For
, similar reasons, we direct the A.O. to allow the weighted deduction. ,
Ground no. 7 is allowed.
100\. Ground no. 8 relates to the denial of weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) on
revenue expenditures.
101\. Once again, the issues are same as raised vide ground no. 6 hereinabove.
For our detailed discussion therein, we direct accordingly. Ground no. 8 is
allowed. ,
102\. Ground no. 9 relates to the claim of deduction of remuneration received
from partnership firm for determination of book profit u/s. 115JB.
103\. Facts in issue are that the appellant company has claimed to have
(received remuneration of Rs. 40.12 crs from partnership firm Sun Pharma
(Industries (SPI) which was deducted while working: out profit u/s. 115JB of
the Act. It was claimed by the assessee that remuneration was nothing but ITA
Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11
& 2012-13
\- 156 -
an appropriation of the profit of the firms which should be deducted by
treating the same as part of exempt income to which provision of Section 10 of
the Act applies. This contention of the assessee did not find any favour with
the A.O. who refused to allow deduction of remuneration of Rs.
40.12 crores while computing book profit u/s. 115JB of the Act.
183.1 Besides the above, we also place our reliance on the order ITAT in the
own case in ITA No. 1663/AHD/2016 wherein it was held as under:
> 159\. At the very outset, the ld. Senior Counsel for the assessee brought to

183.2. Further the relevant extract of the judgment of the Torrent
pharmaceuticals ltd bearing ITA No. 4343 & 4356/Ahd/2007 for the AY 2002-03
vide order dated 31-01-2011 are reproduced as under:
> At the outset Ld. Counsel for the assessee stated that this issue is

183.3. The facts of the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above. The ld. DR has also not brought anything on record contrary
to the finding of ld. CIT-A, and the argument advanced by the Ld. AR for the
assessee. Therefore respectfully following the same, we do not want to disturb
the finding of ld. CIT-A.
183.4 However, we note that the AO has made the disallowance of the expenses
not certified by the DSIR. As such the issue of the verification of the
expenses pertaining to R & D facility is not arising from the order of the AO.
However the ld. CIT-A allowed the relief to the assessee subject to the
direction that the AO shall verify whether the expenditure claimed by the
assessee belongs to the R & D facility of the assessee. However, we note that
there are certain expenses which were disallowed by the AO treating them not
connected with the R & D facility of the assessee.
183.4 The details of such expenses stand as under:
> (a) Patent and Trade 38.30 Mark ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and
> ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals

184\. The issue raised by the assessee in the ground no. 14 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in confirmed the addition made by the AO for Rs. 5,99,53,963/- on
account interest received on the income tax refund.
184.1 On the basis of AIR data/ ITS detail, the AO found that the assessee has
received interest on income tax refund u/s 244A of the Act of Rs.
5,99,53,963/- for AY 2009-10 & 2011-12 vide letter dated 21-09-
> ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By
> Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years -
> 2010-11 & 2012-13
> \- 160 -
2015\. However, the assessee has not disclosed it in the return of income.
Accordingly, assessee was sought to explain for the same.
184.2 In reply to the question of AO, the assessee filed a letter dated 22-
02-2016 by stating that it has not accounted for such income during the year
under consideration.
185.3 In view of the above, the AO accordingly added the amount of Rs.
5,99,53,963/- to the total income of the assessee.
186\. Aggrieved assessee carried the matter to Ld. CIT (A) who confirmed the
order of the AO by observing that the assessee failed to furnish any
acceptable reason against the action of the AO.
187\. Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.CIT (A) assessee is in appeal
before us:
188\. The Ld. AR before us conceded that the issue stands against the
assessee. On the contrary the Ld. DR before relied on the order of authorities
below.
189\. We have heard the rival contentions of the parties and perused the
materials available on record. As the issue stands against the assessee by the
order of Tribunal in the case of Avada trading Co.(P) ltd. Vs ACIT reported in
100 ITD 131.

"In view of the above discussion, we are of the view that interest on refund
under section 244A(1) would be assessable in the year in which it is granted
and not in the year in which proceedings under section 143(1)(a) attain
finality."
In view of the we do not find any reason to interfere in the finding of the
Ld.CIT(A). Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is dismissed.
190\. The issue raised by the assessee in the additional ground, i.e. ground
no. 15 for the relief u/s 10(15) of the Act for interest on tax-free bond
which assessee mistakenly offered to tax.
190.1 The ground raised by the assessee is legal in nature which can be
admitted at any stage of the proceedings. For this proposition we find support
and guidance from the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of CIT Vs.
Sinhgad technical education society reported in 397 ITR 344 wherein it was
held as under:
> "The Tribunal permitted this additional ground by giving a reason that it
> was a jurisdictional issue taken up on the basis of facts already on the
> record and, therefore, could be raised. In this behalf, it was noted by the
> Tribunal that as per the provisions of section 153C, incriminating material
> which was seized had to pertain to the assessment years in question and it
> is an undisputed fact that the documents which were seized did not establish
> any co-relation, document-wise, with these four assessment years. Since this
> requirement under section 153C is essential for assessment under that
> provision, it becomes a jurisdictional fact. This reasoning appears to be
> logical and valid, having regard to the provisions of section 153C. Order of
> the Tribunal reveals that the Tribunal had scanned through the Satisfaction
> Note and the material which was disclosed therein was culled out and it
> showed that the same belongs to assessment year 2004-05 or thereafter. After
> taking note of the material and discussing it, it was specifically recorded
> that the Department could not point out to the contrary. It is for this

> The Tribunal thus, rightly permitted this additional ground to be raised and
> correctly dealt with the same ground on merits as well. Order of the High

> fee is concerned. Whatever other repercussions are there, based on these
> findings, they can follow."
In view of the above, we admit the additional ground raised by the assessee
and restore the matter to the file of AO for fresh adjudication. Hence the
ground of appeal of the assessee is allowed for statistical purposes.
191\. In the result the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for the
statistical purposes.
192\. Now we take up the Revenue appeal in ITA No. 1234/Ahd/2017 for AY
2012-13 The Revenue has raised the following ground as under:
1\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T, (A) was justified in directing the A.o. to delete the addition on
account of interest on loan to ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and
ITA Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals

\- 163 -
A.Es of Rs. 13,43,79,010/-without appreciating that till the amount advanced
by the assesee to its Associated Enterprise, was adjusted towards equity
capital, the amount remained in the form of advance and hence for that period
of time the assessee ought to have charged interest on loan advanced to its
A.E.
2\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.o. to delete the addition on
account of interest on loan to A.Es of Rs. 13,43,79,010/-without appreciating
that the assesee did not establish the commercial expediency of not charging
interest on loan/advance to A.E. and without appreciating that though
susbstantial substantial foreign exchange risk was involved on account of
severe foreign exchange fluctuation, the assessee did not charge interest on
loan to A.E. when the A.E. of the assesee did not provide security for the
loan/advance received.
3\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law was
justified in directing the A.O. to allow weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of
the Act on trade mark registration charges and overseas product registration
charges without appreciating that the A.O. had correctly disallowed the
assesee's claim of weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of the Act since the the
expenses on trade mark registaration charges and overseas product registration
charges were incurred by the assessee outside India and hence the same could
not be considered for the purpose of allowance of weighted deduction u/s.
35(2AB) of the Act.
4\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.O. to allow weighted deduction on
expenses relating to building repairs and Muncipal Taxes amounting to Rs.
1,21,59,206/-without appreciating that the A.O. had correctly disallowed
expenditure on repair to building and municipal taxes u/s. 35(2AB) of the Act
since the assesee did not establish as to how expenditure on repair to
building and municipal tadaes lead to improvement in R & D activitities
carried on by the assessee.
5\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A. O. to allow weighted deduction at
200% on lunch and refreshment and brokerage for property without appreciating
that the A.O. had correctly disallowed expenses on lunch and refreshement u/s.
35(2AB) of the Act, sicne the expenses incurred by the assessee for guest and
others were outside the R & D Centers, and expenses on brokerage had no direct
nexus with the R & D activity carried on by the assessee.
6\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in allowing weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of the
Act on the expenses related to trade mark registration charges, overseas
product registration charges, repairs to building & municipal taxes, lunch and
refreshment expenses, brokerage charges for property without appreciating that
in accordance with the provision of section 35(2AB) of the Act, weighted
deduction u/s. 35(2AB) is allowable only if the expenditure incurred on
scientific research is approved by the prescribed Authority i.e. Secretary,
D.S.I.R. Govt of India as is evident from the discussion made in the
assessment ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929 &
1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT

order, the assesee did not establish that the Secretary, D.S.I.R. had approved
the above referred expenditure for the purpose of weighted deduction u/s.
35(2AB) of the Act.
7\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CI.T. (A) was justified in holding that " The appellant company has incurred
the expenditure of Rs. 1,70,95,96,941/- also for the purpose of its business
through the partnership firm and accordingly disallowance u/s, 37 is not
called for" without appreciating that the A.O. had correctly disallowed the
expenditure on selling and distribution expenses incurred by the assessee u/s.
37(1) of the Act, since the assessee had debited the expenses on selling and
distribution expenses on behalf of separate entity i.e. SPI and hence the
assessee did not incur expenses wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its
own business.
8\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
CI.T. (A) was justified in holding that " The appellant company has incurred
the expenditure of Rs. 1,70,95,96,941/- also for the purpose of its business
through the partnership firm and accordingly disallowance u/s. 37 is not
called for" without appreciating that the assessee in its books of account had
debited the selling & distribution expenses incurred on behalf of S.P.I, with
the sole intention of reducing its profit with an intention to minimise its
tax liability.
9\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) ws justified in holding that " The appellant is eligible for
deduction u/s. 80IA(4) in respect of income of Captive Power Generation Unit
and hence the Assessing Officer is directed to allow the same after correctly
computing the income of eligible unit " without appreciating that the A.O. by
relying on the provision of 80A(4) 80AB, SOB 80IA(1) of the Act had correctly
disallowed assessee's claim of deduction u/s. 80IA(4) of the Act.
10\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T, (A) was justified in holding that " The appellant is eligible for
deduction u/s. 80IA(4) in respect of income of Captive Power Generation Unit
and hence the Assessing Officer is directed to allow the same after correctly
computing the income of eligible unit", without appreciating that the assessee
did not substantiate its claim with facts and figures to prove that it had
included profit of the Undertaking derived from utilization of captive power
Genertion Unit in the gross total income.
11\. Whether On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in holding that "The R & D expenses incurred by the
appellant are required to be allocated in the ratio of turnover of appellant
and SPI/SPS" without appreciating that the A.O. had correctly allocated R & D
expenses in the ratio of turnover of formulations manufactured in SPIL, SPI
and SPS, since products manufactured in units under SPI and SPS were
formulations whereas both Formulation and bulk drugs were manufactured by
units under SPIL and the product manufactured in Units under S.P.I, and SPS
were developed at the R 85 D facilties of SPIL, in whose books of accounts
such R 85 D expenses ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA Nos.929

\- 165 -
12\. Whether on the facts and in circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) erred in holding that "The expenses incurred for development of
Formulation Drug for domestic market are to be considered only because SPI and
has no business outside the country" without appreciating the factual finding
recorded by the A.O. in the assessment order to the effect that "Further both
SPIL and the partnership firms i.e. SPI and SPS are selling products overseas
as well as in local market"
13\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the AO. to the disallowance to the
extent of Rs.84,99,194/- being conference fees and sponsorship, without
appreciating that the A.O, had correctly disallowed the expenses on conference
fees and sponsorship, since the said expenses incurred by the assessee were in
the nature of freebies/gift to the medical practineers, thereby assessee had
violated the Regulations laid down by Medical Council of India.
14\. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.O. to verify each and every item
of the expenses not certified by D.S.I.R. included in Rs. 2046.99 lacs and
then allow consequential relief without appreciating that the A.O. had
correctly disallowed assessee's claim of weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of
the Act to the extent of Rs. 2046.99 lacs since the A.O. has no power to allow
weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of the Act in excess of what has been approved
by D.S.I.R. in accordance with the provision of section 35(2AB) of the Act.
15\. Whether on the facts and Circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.O. to verify each and every item
of the expenses not certified by D.S.I.R. included in Rs. 2046.99 lacs and
then allow consequential relief without appreciating that it was for the
assesee to approach the Secretary, D.S.I.R. for reconsideration of approval of
expenditure on scientific rsearch to the extent of Rs. 2046.99 lacs not
considered in certificate issued by the Secretary, D.S.I.R.. for the purpose
of weighted deduction u/s. 35(2AB) of the Act.
16\. Whether on the facts and Circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.O. to verify each and every item
of the expenses not certified by D.S.I.R. included in Rs. 2046.99 lacs and
then allow consequential relief without appreciating that in accordance with
the Scheme of Section 35(2AB) of the Act, the approval of expenditure on
Scientific research is the guiding factor for the A.O, to determine the
allowance or otherwise of the weighted deduction u/s. 35(SAB) of the Act
claimed by the assessee.
17\. Whether on the facts and Circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
C.I.T. (A) was justified in directing the A.O. to verify each and every item
of the expenses not certified by D.S.I.R. included in Rs. 2046.99 lacs and
then allow consequential relief without appreciating that "It is competent
authority which has to decide whether a particular expenditure is eligible for
deduction u/s. 35(2AB) or not, but not the A.O. " as held by the Hon'ble

193\. The first issue raised by the Revenue in Ground No. 1 and 2 is that the
CIT(A) erred in reducing the addition on account of interest on loans to AEs

193.1 We have already decided the impugned issues against the Revenue in the
ground of appeal bearing no. 1 vide Para No.106 & 107 of this order in ITA

194\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 3 is that the Ld.CIT

195\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 4 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in deleting the addition of weighted deduction made under section
35(2AB) of the Act on building repairs and municipal taxes expenses of Rs.
1,21,59,206/-.
195.1 During the year under consideration, assessee has incurred expenses on
repairs to building amounting to Rs. 88,20,437/- and municipal taxes amounting
to Rs. 33,38,769/-. The assessee in respect of such expenses claimed the
weighted deduction on repair to building amounting to Rs. 1,76,40,873/-and
municipal taxes amounting to Rs. 66,77,538/-only.
196\. The AO was of the view that the above cost is in relation to the
building which is not eligible for weighted deduction under section 35(2AB) of
the Act.
196.1 The assessee in response to the notice issued by the AO explained that
the word "expenditure in the nature of cost of any land or building" used in
section 35(2AB) of the Act relates to the purchase of any land or building.
But the expenses claimed by it are in the nature of wear & tear expenses which
are not capital in nature for the land or building. Therefore the repair and
maintenance charges cannot be considered as the cost of the building. These
expenses were incurred for wear & tear and maintenance of the building. These
expenses are not bringing the ITA Nos.922 & 1234/Ahd/2017 (By Revenue) and ITA
Nos.929 & 1237/Ahd/2017 (By Assessee) DCIT vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals
Inds.Ltd.vs. DCIT Asst.Years - 2010-11 & 2012-13
\- 168 -
building into existence or to put to use for work. Therefore expenses are not
in the nature of capital.
196.2 Repair of building expenses incurred for the building in which the
research and development activity carried out.
196.3 However, the AO rejected the contention of the assessee by observing
that the repair and maintenance and municipal tax expenses incurred by the
assessee pertaining to the building in which R&D activities carried out.
Therefore on these expenses only 100% deduction allowable not weighted
deduction.
197\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal before the Ld.CIT (A) who deleted
the addition made by the AO by observing as under:
> 9\. Ground No. 6 pertains to the disallowance of weighted deduction u/s
> 35(2AB) on expenses relating to Building repairs and Municipal taxes

198\. Being aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT-A, the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
199\. Both the parties before us relied on the order of authorities below as
favorable to them.
200\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. At the outset, we note that the ld. CIT-A
deleted the addition after having reliance of the order of his predecessor for
the AY 2008-09. We further note that the Revenue against the order of the ld.
CIT-A preferred an appeal before the Tribunal in ITA No. 3297/AHD/2014 which
was decided in favor of the assessee vide order dated 16-6-2017. The relevant
extract is reproduced below.
72\. Ground no. 2 relates to the deletion of the disallowance of Rs.
42,46,000/- claimed u/s. 35(2AB) of the Act on repairs and municipal taxes
paid for building utilized for R & D activity.
73\. An identical issue was considered by the Co-ordinate Bench in ITA No.
1592/Ahd/2011 qua ground nos. 2 & 3 of that appeal. In ground no. 1 of the
present appeal, we have extracted the relevant part of the decision of the Co-
ordinate Bench. For the reasons given therein, ground no. 2 is also dismissed.
200.1 The facts of the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case as
discussed above. The ld. DR has also not brought anything on record contrary
to the finding of ld. CIT-A, and the argument advanced by the ld. AR for the
assessee. Therefore respectfully following the same, we do not want to disturb
the finding of ld. CIT-A. Hence the ground of appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.

201\. The issue raised by the Revenue in ground number 5 is that the Ld.CIT
(A) erred in allowing the weighted deduction claimed under section 35(2AB) of
