The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
11. Relative grounds for refusal of registration.—
(1) Save as provided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if,
because of—
(a) its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or
services covered by the trade mark; or
(b) its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of
the goods or services covered by the trade mark, there exists a likelihood of
confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of
association with the earlier trade mark.
(2) A trade mark which—
(a) is identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and
(b) is to be registered for goods or services which are not similar to those
for which the earlier trade mark is registered in the name of a different
proprietor, shall not be registered, if or to the extent, the earlier trade
mark is a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later mark without
due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive
character or repute of the earlier trade mark.
(3) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in
India is liable to be prevented—
(a) by virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off protecting an
unregistered trade mark used in the course of trade; or
(b) by virtue of law of copyright.
(4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a trade mark
where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right consents
to the registration, and in such case the Registrar may register the mark
under special circumstances under section 12. Explanation.—For the purposes of
this section, earlier trade mark means—
(a) a registered trade mark or convention application referred to in section
154 which has a date of application earlier than that of the trade mark in
question, taking account, where appropriate, of the priorities claimed in
respect of the trade marks;
(b) a trade mark which, on the date of the application for registration of the
trade mark in question, or where appropriate, of the priority claimed in
respect of the application, was entitled to protection as a well-known trade
mark.
(5) A trade mark shall not be refused registration on the grounds specified in
sub-sections (2) and (3), unless objection on any one or more of those grounds
is raised in opposition proceedings by the proprietor of the earlier trade
mark.
(6) The Registrar shall, while determining whether a trade mark is a well-
known trade mark, take into account any fact which he considers relevant for
determining a trade mark as a well-known trade mark including—
(i) the knowledge or recognition of that trade mark in the relevant section of
the public including knowledge in India obtained as a result of promotion of
the trade mark;
(ii) the duration, extent and geographical area of any use of that trade mark;
(iii) the duration, extent and geographical area of any promotion of the trade
mark, including advertising or publicity and presentation, at fairs or
exhibition of the goods or services to which the trade mark applies;
(iv) the duration and geographical area of any registration of or any
application for registration of that trade mark under this Act to the extent
they reflect the use or recognition of the trade mark;
(v) the record of successful enforcement of the rights in that trade mark; in
particular, the extent to which the trade mark has been recognised as a well-
known trade mark by any court or Registrar under that record.
(7) The Registrar shall, while determining as to whether a trade mark is known
or recognised in a relevant section of the public for the purposes of sub-
section (6), take into account—
(i) the number of actual or potential consumers of the goods or services;
(ii) the number of persons involved in the channels of distribution of the
goods or services;
(iii) the business circles dealing with the goods or services, to which that
trade mark applies.
(8) Where a trade mark has been determined to be well-known in at least one
relevant section of the public in India by any court or Registrar, the
Registrar shall consider that trade mark as a well-known trade mark for
registration under this Act.
(9) The Registrar shall not require as a condition, for determining whether a
trade mark is a well-known trade mark, any of the following, namely:—
(i) that the trade mark has been used in India;
(ii) that the trade mark has been registered;
(iii) that the application for registration of the trade mark has been filed
in India;
(iv) that the trade mark—
(a) is well known in; or
(b) has been registered in; or
(c) in respect of which an application for registration has been filed in, any
jurisdiction other than India; or
(v) that the trade mark is well-known to the public at large in India.
(10) While considering an application for registration of a trade mark and
opposition filed in respect thereof, the Registrar shall—
(i) protect a well-known trade mark against the identical or similar trade
marks;
(ii) take into consideration the bad faith involved either of the applicant or
the opponent affecting the right relating to the trade mark.
(11) Where a trade mark has been registered in good faith disclosing the
material informations to the Registrar or where right to a trade mark has been
acquired through use in good faith before the commencement of this Act, then,
nothing in this Act shall prejudice the validity of the registration of that
trade mark or right to use that trade mark on the ground that such trade mark
is identical with or similar to a well-known trade mark.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
12. Registration in the case of honest concurrent use, etc.—In the case of honest concurrent use or of other special circumstances which in the opinion of the Registrar, make it proper so to do, he may permit the registration by more than one proprietor of the trade marks which are identical or similar (whether any such trade mark is already registered or not) in respect of the same or similar goods or services, subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, as the Registrar may think fit to impose.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
13. Prohibition of registration of names of chemical elements or international non-proprietary names.—No word—
(a) which is the commonly used and accepted name of any single chemical
element or any single chemical compound (as distinguished from a mixture) in
respect of a chemical substance or preparation, or
(b) which is declared by the World Health Organisation and notified in the
prescribed manner by the Registrar from time to time, as an international non-
proprietary name or which is deceptively similar to such name, shall be
registered as a trade mark and any such registration shall be deemed for the
purpose of section 57 to be an entry made in the register without sufficient
cause or an entry wrongly remaining on the register, as the circumstances may
require.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
14. Use of names and representations of living persons or persons recently dead.—Where an application is made for the registration of a trade mark which falsely suggests a connection with any living person, or a person whose death took place within twenty years prior to the date of application for registration of the trade mark, the Registrar may, before he proceeds with the application, require the applicant to furnish him with the consent in writing of such living person or, as the case may be, of the legal representative of the deceased person to the connection appearing on the trade mark, and may refuse to proceed with the application unless the applicant furnishes the registrar with such consent.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
15. Registration of parts of trade marks and of trade marks as a series.—
(1) Where the proprietor of a trade mark claims to be entitled to the
exclusive use of any part thereof separately, he may apply to register the
whole and the part as separate trade marks.
(2) Each such separate trade mark shall satisfy all the conditions applying to
and have all the incidents of, an independent trade mark.
(3) Where a person claiming to be the proprietor of several trade marks in
respect of the same or similar goods or services or description of goods or
description of services, which, while resembling each other in the material
particulars thereof, yet differ in respect of—
(a) statement of the goods or services in relation to which they are
respectively used or proposed to be used; or
(b) statement of number, price, quality or names of places; or
(c) other matter of a non-distinctive character which does not substantially
affect the identity of the trade mark; or
(d) colour, seeks to register those trade marks, they may be registered as a
series in one registration.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
16. Registration of trade marks as associated trade marks.—
(1) Where a trade mark which is registered, or is the subject of an
application for registration, in respect of any goods or services is identical
with another trade mark which is registered, or is the subject of an
application for registration, in the name of the same proprietor in respect of
the same goods or description of goods or same services or description of
services or so nearly resembles it as to be likely to deceive or cause
confusion if used by a person other than the proprietor, the Registrar may, at
any time, require that the trade marks shall be entered on the register as
associated trade marks.
(2) Where there is an identity or near resemblance of marks that are
registered, or are the subject of applications for registration in the name of
the same proprietor, in respect of goods and in respect of services which are
associated with those goods or goods of that description and with those
services or services of that description, sub-section (1) shall apply as it
applies as where there is an identity or near resemblance of marks that are
registered, or are the subject of applications for registration, in the name
of the same proprietor in respect of the same goods or description of goods or
same services or description of services.
(3) Where a trade mark and any part thereof are, in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15, registered as separate trade
marks in the name of the same proprietor, they shall be deemed to be, and
shall be registered as, associated trade marks.
(4) All trade marks registered in accordance with the provisions of sub-
section (3) of section 15 as a series in one registration shall be deemed to
be, and shall be registered as, associated trade marks.
(5) On application made in the prescribed manner by the registered proprietor
of two or more trade marks registered as associated trade marks, the Registrar
may dissolve the association as respects any of them if he is satisfied that
there would be no likelihood of deception or confusion being caused if that
trade mark were used by any other person in relation to any of the goods or
services or both in respect of which it is registered, and may amend the
register accordingly.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
17. Effect of registration of parts of a mark.—
(1) When a trade mark consists of several matters, its registration shall
confer on the proprietor exclusive right to the use of the trade mark taken as
a whole.

(i) which is not the subject of a separate application by the proprietor for
registration as a trade mark; or
(ii) which is not separately registered by the proprietor as a trade mark; or
(b) contains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a non-
distinctive character, the registration thereof shall not confer any exclusive
right in the matter forming only a part of the whole of the trade mark so
registered.

The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
26. Effect of removal from register for failure to pay fee for renewal.—Where a trade mark has been removed from the register for failure to pay the fee for renewal, it shall nevertheless, for the purpose of any application for the registration of another trade mark during one year, next after the date of the removal, be deemed to be a trade mark already on the register, unless the tribunal is satisfied either—
(a) that there has been no bona fide trade use of the trade mark which has
been removed during the two years immediately preceding its removal; or
(b) that no deception or confusion would be likely to arise from the use of
the trade mark which is the subject of the application for registration by
reason of any previous use of the trade mark which has been removed.

are identical with or nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the
use of any of those trade marks shall not (except so far as their respective
rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register)
be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any
other of those persons merely by registration of the trade marks but each of
those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons (not
being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he would have if he
were the sole registered proprietor.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
29. Infringement of registered trade marks.—
(1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the
course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to,
the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade
mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely
to be taken as being used as a trade mark.
(2) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the
course of trade, a mark which because of—
(a) its identity with the registered trade mark and the similarity of the
goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or
(b) its similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity
of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or
(c) its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the goods
or services covered by such registered trade mark, is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public, or which is likely to have an association
with the registered trade mark.
(3) In any case falling under clause (c) of sub-section (2), the court shall
presume that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public.
(4) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the
course of trade, a mark which—
(a) is identical with or similar to the registered trade mark; and
(b) is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those
for which the trade mark is registered; and
(c) the registered trade mark has a reputation in India and the use of the
mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the
distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark.
(5) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person if he uses such
registered trade mark, as his trade name or part of his trade name, or name of
his business concern or part of the name, of his business concern dealing in
goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
(6) For the purposes of this section, a person uses a registered mark, if, in
particular, he—
(a) affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof;
(b) offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them on the market, or stocks them
for those purposes under the registered trade mark, or offers or supplies
services under the registered trade mark;
(c) imports or exports goods under the mark; or
(d) uses the registered trade mark on business papers or in advertising.
(7) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who applies such
registered trade mark to a material intended to be used for labelling or
packaging goods, as a business paper, or for advertising goods or services,
provided such person, when he applied the mark, knew or had reason to believe
that the application of the mark was not duly authorised by the proprietor or
a licensee.
(8) A registered trade mark is infringed by any advertising of that trade mark
if such advertising—
(a) takes unfair advantage of and is contrary to honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters; or
(b) is detrimental to its distinctive character; or
(c) is against the reputation of the trade mark.
(9) Where the distinctive elements of a registered trade mark consist of or
include words, the trade mark may be infringed by the spoken use of those
words as well as by their visual representation and reference in this section
to the use of a mark shall be construed accordingly.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
30. Limits on effect of registered trade mark.—
(1) Nothing in section 29 shall be construed as preventing the use of a
registered trade mark by any person for the purposes of identifying goods or
services as those of the proprietor provided the use—
(a) is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial
matters, and
(b) is not such as to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the
distinctive character or repute of the trade mark.
(2) A registered trade mark is not infringed where—
(a) the use in relation to goods or services indicates the kind, quality,
quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production
of goods or of rendering of services or other characteristics of goods or
services;
(b) a trade mark is registered subject to any conditions or limitations, the
use of the trade mark in any manner in relation to goods to be sold or
otherwise traded in, in any place, or in relation to goods to be exported to
any market or in relation to services for use or available or acceptance in
any place or country outside India or in any other circumstances, to which,
having regard to those conditions or limitations, the registration does not
extend;
(c) the use by a person of a trade mark—
(i) in relation to goods connected in the course of trade with the proprietor
or a registered user of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk or
which they form part, the registered proprietor or the registered user
conforming to the permitted use has applied the trade mark and has not
subsequently removed or obliterated it, or has at any time expressly or
impliedly consented to the use of the trade mark; or
(ii) in relation to services to which the proprietor of such mark or of a
registered user conforming to the permitted use has applied the mark, where
the purpose and effect of the use of the mark is to indicate, in accordance
with the fact, that those services have been performed by the proprietor or a
registered user of the mark;
(d) the use of a trade mark by a person in relation to goods adapted to form
part of, or to be accessory to, other goods or services in relation to which
the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given by
registration under this Act or might for the time being be so used, if the use
of the trade mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods
or services are so adapted, and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use
of the trade mark is to indicate, otherwise than in accordance with the fact,
a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods or
services, as the case may be;
(e) the use of a registered trade mark, being one of two or more trade marks
registered under this Act which are identical or nearly resemble each other,
in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration
under this Act.
(3) Where the goods bearing a registered trade mark are lawfully acquired by a
person, the sale of the goods in the market or otherwise dealing in those
goods by that person or by a person claiming under or through him is not
infringement of a trade by reason only of—
(a) the registered trade mark having been assigned by the registered
proprietor to some other person, after the acquisition of those goods; or
(b) the goods having been put on the market under the registered trade mark by
the proprietor or with his consent.
(4) Sub-section (3) shall not apply where there exists legitimate reasons for
the proprietor to oppose further dealings in the goods in particular, where
the condition of the goods, has been changed or impaired after they have been
put on the market.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
31. Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity.—
(1) In all legal proceedings relating to a trade mark registered under this
Act (including applications under section 57), the original registration of
the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions of the
trade mark shall be prima facie evidence of the validity thereof.
(2) In all legal proceedings as aforesaid a registered trade mark shall not be
held to be invalid on the ground that it was not a registrable trade mark
under section 9 except upon evidence of distinctiveness and that such evidence
was not submitted to the Registrar before registration, if it is proved that
the trade mark had been so used by the registered proprietor or his
predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of
registration.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
32. Protection of registration on ground of distinctiveness in certain cases.—Where a trade mark is registered in breach of sub-section
(1) of section 9, it shall not be declared invalid if, in consequence of the
use which has been made of it, it has after registration and before
commencement of any legal proceedings challenging the validity of such
registration, acquired a distinctive character in relation to the goods or
services for which it is registered.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
33. Effect of acquiescence.—
(1) Where the proprietor of an earlier trade mark has acquiesced for a
continuous period of five years in the use of a registered trade mark, being
aware of that use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of that earlier
trade mark—
(a) to apply for a declaration that the registration of the later trade mark
is invalid, or
(b) to oppose the use of the later trade mark in relation to the goods or
services in relation to which it has been so used, unless the registration of
the later trade mark was not applied in good faith.
(2) Where sub-section (1) applies, the proprietor of the later trade mark is
not entitled to oppose the use of the earlier trade mark, or as the case may
be, the exploitation of the earlier right, notwithstanding that the earlier
trade mark may no longer be invoked against his later trade mark.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
34. Saving for vested rights.—Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods or services in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior—
(a) to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods or
services be the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or
(b) to the date of registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect
of those goods or services in the name of the proprietor of a predecessor in
title of his; whichever is the earlier, and the Registrar shall not refuse (on
such use being proved), to register the second mentioned trade mark by reason
only of the registration of the first mentioned trade mark.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
35. Saving for use of name, address or description of goods or services.—Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere with any bona fide use by a person of his own name or that of his place of business, or of the name, or of the name of the place of business, of any of his predecessors in business, or the use by any person of any bona fide description of the character or quality of his goods or services.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
36. Saving for words used as name or description of an article or substance or service.—
(1) The registration of a trade mark shall not be deemed to have become
invalid by reason only of any use after the date of the registration of any
word or words which the trade mark contains or of which it consists as the
name or description of an article or substance or service: Provided that, if
it is proved either—
(a) that there is a well known and established use of the said word as the
name or description of the article or substance or service by a person or
persons carrying on trade therein, not being used in relation to goods or
services connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered
user of the trade mark or (in the case of a certification trade mark) in
relation to goods or services certified by the proprietor; or
(b) that the article or substance was formerly manufactured under a patent
that a period of two years or more after the cesser of the patent has elapsed
and that the said word is the only practicable name or description of the
article or substance, the provisions of sub-section (2) shall apply.
(2) Where the facts mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b) of the proviso to
sub-section (1) are proved with respect to any words, then,—
(a) for the purpose of any proceedings under section 57 if the trade mark
consists solely of such words, the registration of the trade mark, so far as
regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question or of
any goods of the same description, or of the services or of any services of
the same description, as the case requires, shall be deemed to be an entry
wrongly remaining on the register;
(b) for the purposes of any other legal proceedings relating to the trade
mark,—
(i) if the trade mark consists solely of such words, all rights of the
proprietor under this Act or any other law to the use of the trade mark; or
(ii) if the trade mark contains such words and other matter, all such right of
the proprietor to the use of such words, in relation to the article or
substance or to any goods of the same description, or to the service or to any
services of the same description, as the case requires, shall be deemed to
have ceased on the date on which the use mentioned in clause (a) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) first became well known and established or at the
expiration of the period of two years mentioned in clause (b) of the said
proviso.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
37. Power of registered proprietor to assign and give receipts.—The person for the time being entered in the register as proprietor of a trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Act and to any rights appearing from the register to be vested in any other person, have power to assign the trade mark, and to give effectual receipts for any consideration for such assignment.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
38. Assignability and transmissibility of registered trade marks.—Notwithstanding anything in any other law to the contrary, a registered trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, be assignable and transmissible, whether with or without the goodwill of the business concerned and in respect either of all the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered or of some only of those goods or services.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
39. Assignability and transmissibility of unregistered trade marks.—An unregistered trade mark may be assigned or transmitted with or without the goodwill of the business concerned.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
40. Restriction on assignment or transmission where multiple exclusive rights would be created.—
(1) Notwithstanding anything in sections 38 and 39, a trade mark shall not be
assignable or transmissible in a case in which as a result of the assignment
or transmission there would in the circumstances subsist, whether under this
Act or any other law, exclusive rights in more than one of the persons
concerned to the use, in relation to—
(a) same goods or services;
(b) same description of goods or services;
(c) goods or services or description of goods or services which are associated
with each other, of trade marks nearly resembling each other or of identical
trade mark, if having regard to the similarity of the goods and services and
to the similarity of the trade marks, the use of the trade marks in exercise
of those rights would be likely to deceive or cause confusion: Provided that
an assignment or transmission shall not be deemed to be invalid under this
sub-section if the exclusive rights subsisting as a result thereof in the
persons concerned respectively are, having regard to limitations imposed
thereon, such as not to be exercisable by two or more of those persons in
relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, within India otherwise
than for export therefrom, or in relation to goods to be exported to the same
market outside India or in relation to services for use at any place in India
or any place outside India in relation to services available for acceptance in
India.
(2) The proprietor of a registered trade mark who proposes to assign it may
submit to the Registrar in the prescribed manner a statement of case setting
out the circumstances and the Registrar may issue to him a certificate stating
whether, having regard to the similarity of the goods or services and of the
trade marks referred to in the case, the proposed assignment would or would
not be invalid under sub-section (1), and a certificate so issued shall,
subject to appeal and unless it is shown that the certificate was obtained by
fraud or misrepresentation, be conclusive as to the validity or invalidity
under sub-section (1) of the assignment insofar as such validity or invalidity
depends upon the facts set out in the case, but, as regards a certificate in
favour of validity, only if application for the registration under section 45
of the title of the person becoming entitled is made within six months from
the date on which the certificate is issued.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
41. Restriction on assignment or transmission when exclusive rights would be created in different parts of India.—Notwithstanding anything in sections 38 and 39, a trade mark shall not be assignable or transmissible in a case in which as a result of the assignment or transmission there would in the circumstances subsist, whether under this Act or any other law—
(a) an exclusive right in one of the persons concerned, to the use of the
trade mark limited to use in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise traded
in, in any place in India, or in relation to services for use, or services
available for acceptance in any place in India; and
(b) an exclusive right in another of these persons concerned, to the use of a
trade mark nearly resembling the first-mentioned trade mark or of an identical
trade mark in relation to—
(i) the same goods or services; or
(ii) the same description of goods or services; or
(iii) services which are associated with those goods or goods of that
description or goods which are associated with those services or services of
that description, limited to use in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise
traded in, or services for use, or available for acceptance, in any other
place in India: Provided that in any such case, on application in the
prescribed manner by the proprietor of a trade mark who proposes to assign it,
or by a person who claims that a registered trade mark has been transmitted to
him or to a predecessor in title of his since the commencement of this Act,
the Registrar, if he is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the
trade mark in exercise of the said rights would not be contrary to the public
interest may approve the assignment or transmission, and an assignment or
transmission so approved shall not, unless it is shown that the approval was
obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, be deemed to be invalid under this
section or section 40 if application for the registration under section 45 of
the title of the person becoming entitled is made within six months from the
date on which the approval is given or, in the case of a transmission, was
made before that date.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
42. Conditions for assignment otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of a business.—Where an assignment of a trade mark, whether registered or unregistered is made otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of the business in which the mark has been or is used, the assignment shall not take effect unless the assignee, not later than the expiration of six months from the date on which the assignment is made or within such extended period, if any, not exceeding three months in the aggregate, as the Registrar may allow, applies to the Registrar for directions with respect to the advertisement of the assignment, and advertises it in such form and manner and within such period as the Registrar may direct. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, an assignment of a trade mark of the following description shall not be deemed to be an assignment made otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of the business in which the mark is used, namely:—
(a) an assignment of a trade mark in respect only of some of the goods or
services for which the trade mark is registered accompanied by the transfer of
the goodwill of the business concerned in those goods or services only; or
(b) an assignment of a trade mark which is used in relation to goods exported
from India or in relation to services for use outside India if the assignment
is accompanied by the transfer of the goodwill of the export business only.

44. Assignability and transmissibility of associated trade marks.—Associated trade marks shall be assignable and transmissible only as a whole and not separately, but, subject to the provisions of this Act, they shall, for all other purposes, be deemed to have been registered as separate trade marks.

(1) Where a person becomes entitled by assignment or transmission to a
registered trade mark, he shall apply in the prescribed manner to the
Registrar to register his title, and the Registrar shall, on receipt of the
application and on proof of title to his satisfaction, register him as the
proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods or services in respect of
which the assignment or transmission has effect, and shall cause particulars
of the assignment or transmission to be entered on the register: Provided that
where the validity of an assignment or transmission is in dispute between the
parties, the Registrar may refuse to register the assignment or transmission
until the rights of the parties have been determined by a competent court.
(2) Except for the purpose of an application before the Registrar under sub-
section (1) or an appeal from an order thereon, or an application under
section 57 or an appeal from an order thereon, a document or instrument in
respect of which no entry has been made in the register in accordance with
sub-section (1), shall not be admitted in evidence by the Registrar or the
Appellate Board or any court in proof of title to the trade mark by assignment
or transmission unless the Registrar or the Appellate Board or the court, as
the case may be, otherwise directs.

46. Proposed use of trade mark by company to be formed, etc.—
(1) No application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of any
goods or services shall be refused nor shall permission for such registration
be withheld, on the ground only that it appears that the applicant does not
use or propose to use the trade mark if the Registrar is satisfied that—
(a) a company is about to be formed and registered under the Companies Act,

extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold, or otherwise traded in,

or available for acceptance in that place or for use in that country, or the
tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such
a trade mark, on application by that person in the prescribed manner to the
Appellate Board or to the Registrar, the tribunal may impose on the
registration of the first-mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks
proper for securing that registration shall cease to extend to such use.

of sub-section (1) or for the purposes of sub-section (2) on any non-use of a
trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the

identity, as an equivalent for the use required to be proved.

any other law.
(2) The use of a registered trade mark in relation to goods or services
between which and the person using the mark any form of connection in the

to goods or services between which and the said person or a predecessor in
title of that person a different form of connection in the course of trade
subsisted or subsists.

prescribed manner of opposition to the application, the Registrar shall, after
hearing the parties if so required, decide the matter.
(3) Where leave is granted under this section, the trade mark as altered shall

(1) The Registrar shall not make any amendment of the register which would
have the effect of adding any goods or classes of goods or services to those
in respect of which a trade mark is registered (whether in one or more
classes) immediately before the amendment is to be made or of antedating the
registration of a trade mark in respect of any goods or services: Provided
that this sub-section, shall not apply when the Registrar is satisfied that

antedating, as the case may be, would not affect any substantial quantity of
goods or services and would not substantially prejudice the rights of any
person.
(2) A proposal so to amend the register shall be brought to the notice of the
registered proprietor of the trade mark affected and advertised in the
prescribed manner, and may be opposed before the Registrar by any person
aggrieved on the ground that the proposed amendment contravenes the provisions

proprietor of the mark from those of others.
The Trade Marks ACT, 1999
62. Collective mark not to be misleading as to character or significance.—A collective mark shall not be registered if it is likely to deceive or cause confusion on the part of public in particular if it is likely to be taken to be something other than a collective mark, and in such case the Registrar may require that a mark in respect of which application is made for registration comprises some indication that it is a collective mark.

the regulations governing the use of the mark. Explanation I.—For the purposes
of this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, “authorised user”

infringement of the right so given to the use of any other of those trade
marks.
