JUDGMENT S.J. Vazifdar, J.
1\. This Civil Revision Application has been filed against the order dated 8th
September, 2000, passed by the Joint Civil Judge, (Jr. Dn.), Kamptee,
rejecting the applicant/plaintiffs' application for permission to withdraw the
suit with leave to file a fresh suit on the same cause of action.
2\. The applicants' case is that the parties to the suit carry on business as
partners in the firm name and style of M/s National Security Services as per a
deed of partnership dated 4th April, 1997. The applicants filed this suit on
9th March, 2000 inter alia for a declaration that the said firm is a
partnership firm, for a decree of permanent injunction restraining the
defendants from using the firm name as a proprietary concern, and from
carrying on business similar to that of the partnership firm and for an order
directing the defendants to produce the books of accounts duly audited and to
pay the applicants their share of profits in the firm.
10\. This leaves for consideration the matter on merits. In my view, there is
no reason why the applicants/plaintiffs' application ought not to be granted.
On 31st August, 1997 i.e. within four months of the formation of the
partnership firm. An application for registration thereof was duly made with
the Registrar of firms. The suit was filed on 9th March, 2000. The firm was
registered on 28th April, 2000. The applicants/plaintiffs were not responsible
for the delay. The respondents/defendants cannot be prejudiced in any manner
by the applicants/plaintiffs being permitted to agitate their rights. The
affidavit in reply discloses no reasons why any prejudice would be caused to
the respondents if the application is allowed. That the applicants alleged in
the plaint that the - firm was registered is not relevant in deciding this
application. It is an aspect which will fall for consideration when the
applicants plead grounds for saving the bar of limitation in the fresh suit
which they may file. Suffice it to say that there are several obvious bona-
fide reasons why this erroneous plea was taken.
11\. In the circumstances the impugned order dated 8th September, 2000 is set
pay the applicants their share of profits in the firm.
3\. Admittedly, when the suit was filed the firm was not registered under
Section 59 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (hereinafter referred to as the
said Act). The application for registration was made on 31st August, 1997. The
firm was however registered only on 28th April, 2000 i.e. after the suit was
filed.
Realising that the defect arising as a result of the non-registration of the
firm on the date on which the suit was filed may lead to a dismissal of the
suit in view of the provisions of Section 69 of the Act as amended by the
Indian Partnership (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1984 which inserted Section
69-A in the said Act, the plaintiff filed the said application for permission
to withdraw the suit with leave to file a fresh suit on the same cause of
action. A fresh suit would not be barred by the provisions of Section 69 of
the Act, as the firm had thereafter been registered on 28th April, 2000.
4\. The learned Judge rejected the applicants' application relying upon a
judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court. The order was
sought to be supported on behalf of the respondent by relying upon a judgment
of a Division Bench of this Court. These judgments do support the respondents'
case. I have however come to the conclusion that both these judgments have
been impliedly overruled by a judgment of the Supreme Court. I shall proceed
now to refer to these judgments.
5\. The learned Judge rejected the above application holding that the defect
of non-registration is not a formal defect within the meaning of Order 23,
Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as the suit was itself not
maintainable and barred under Section 69 of the Act. The learned Judge relied
upon the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court in
Khatuna v. Ramsewak Kashinath, , which is directly on the point and supports
the case of the respondents.
6\. Mr. Agrawal, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondents/defendants also relied upon the judgment of a Division Bench of
this Court in the case of M. L. Chaturvedi v. M/s Sanjay Finance Corporation,
1998(1) BCR 782. This judgment also supports the respondents' case. In that
case a learned Single Judge granted the plaintiff permission to withdraw the
summary suit filed by him with liberty to file a fresh suit. The Appeal Court
which set aside the order held as under:-
"6. In AIR 1977 SC 330, Loonkaran Sethia v. Ivan E. John, interpreting the
provisions of Section 69, the Supreme Court made the following observations :-
"A bare glance at the section is enough to show that it is mandatory in
character and its effect is to render a suit by a plaintiff in respect of a
right vested in him or acquired by him under a contract which he entered into
as a partner of an unregistered firm, whether existing or dissolved, void. In
other words, a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot
bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract falling within the
ambit of Section 69 of the Partnership Act. "
The Supreme Court reiterated this position in 1989 Bank., J. 572 (S.C.) : 1989
Mh.LJ. 849, Shreeram Finance Corporation v. Yasin Khan and others, it was held
that since the persons suing namely, the current partners as on the date of
suit were not shown as partners in the Register of Firms. The suit was not
maintainable in view of the provisions of Section 69(2) of the Partnership
Act. Although the plaint was amended on a later date that could not save the
suit. In the light of the principle laid down in the aforesaid decisions, it
appears that the law is well settled that a firm not registered under Section
59 suffers from the legal disability of enforcing a right arising from a
contract by instituting a suit against a third party by operation of Section
69(2) of the Act. Non registration of the firm, therefore, is not a formal
defect, but a defect affecting the merits of the suit, in other words, the
very root of the plaintiff's suit. It is, therefore, clear that such a defect
in the suit is not a formal defect. The learned Judge was clearly in error in
permitting the plaintiff to withdraw the suit with liberty to file a fresh
one. The view which we are taking is supported by decisions of various other
High Courts. See in this connection Khatunna v. Ramsevak Kashinath, , Wardman
Finance Corporation v. Ghulam Ahmad Lone, A.I.R. 1982 N.O.C. 142 (J. and K.)
and T. Savriraj Pillai v. R.S.S. Vastrad and Company, ."
7\. The above judgments clearly support the defendants/respondents case. Had
the authorities rested there I would be bound to dismiss this C.R.A.
8\. However, Mr. Chandurkar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
applicants/plaintiffs invited my attention to a judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of Haldiram Bhujiawala v. Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar, , In that case
suit was filed by the plaintiff for a permanent injunction restraining the
defendants from using the plaintiff's trade marks and for damages. The Supreme
Court held that the suit was not barred by Section 69(2) of Partnership Act,
1932. The Supreme Court also held as under :-
"26. In fact, the Act has not prescribed that the transactions or contracts
entered into by a firm with a third party are bad in law if the firm is an
unregistered firm. On the other hand, if the firm is not registered on the
date of suit and the suit is to enforce a right arising out of a contract with
the third-party defendant in the course of its business, then it will be open
to the plaintiff to seek withdrawal of the plaint with leave and file a fresh
suit after registration of the firm subject of course to the law of limitation
and subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act. This is so even if the
suit is dismissed for a formal defect. Section 14 of the Limitation Act will
be available inasmuch as the suit has failed because the defect of non-
registration falls within the words "other cause of like nature" in Section 14
of the Limitation Act, 1963 (See Surajmal Dagduramji Shop v. Shrikisan
Ramkisan.)"
9\. The Supreme Court has expressly held that even if the suit is barred under
Section 69 of the Act, it will be open to a plaintiff to seek withdrawal of
the plaint with leave to file a fresh suit after registration of the firm. The
ratio of the judgment of this Court in M. L. Chaturvedi v. Sanjay Finance
Corporation (supra) is therefore contrary to the judgment of the Supreme
Court. The observations at the very leas constitute obiter-dicta of the
Supreme Court and are therefore binding on the High Court. They cannot be
brushed aside as merely casual observations. Mr. Agrawal was unable to
distinguish the judgment of the Supreme Court from the facts of this case.
It must therefore, with great respect, be held that the judgment of this Court
in M. L. Chaturvedi v. M/s Sanjay Finance Corporation (Supra) and the judgment
of the Orissa High Court in Khatuna v. Ramsewak Kashinath (supra) are
impliedly overruled by the judgment of the Supreme Court in Haldiram
Bhujiawala v. Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar, .
10\. This leaves for consideration the matter on merits. In my view, there is
no reason why the applicants/plaintiffs' application ought not to be granted.
On 31st August, 1997 i.e. within four months of the formation of the

the Registrar of firms. The suit was filed on 9th March, 2000. The firm was

by the applicants/plaintiffs being permitted to agitate their rights. The
affidavit in reply discloses no reasons why any prejudice would be caused to
the respondents if the application is allowed. That the applicants alleged in
the plaint that the - firm was registered is not relevant in deciding this
application. It is an aspect which will fall for consideration when the
applicants plead grounds for saving the bar of limitation in the fresh suit
which they may file. Suffice it to say that there are several obvious bona-
fide reasons why this erroneous plea was taken.
11\. In the circumstances the impugned order dated 8th September, 2000 is set
aside. The plaintiff/applicant's original application in R.CS. No. 44/2000
below Exh. 25 is allowed as prayed. The fresh suit shall be subject to the law
of limitation. The counter-claim filed by the respondents/defendants shall be
treated as a separate suit. There shall be no order as to costs.
