    PER D. KARUNAKARA RAO, AM :
          This is the appeal filed by the assessee against the order of
    CIT(A)-2, Kolhapur, dated 27-09-2016 for the Assessment Year 2012-
    13.
    2.    Condonation of delay : Before us, Ld. Counsel for the assessee
    submitted that there was delay of 74 in filing the appeal before the
    Tribunal. It was submitted that assessee filed an application u/s.154 of
    the I.T. Act on 28-09-2016 pointing out certain mistakes in the said
    appeal order.     The application remained undecided.        Ld. Counsel
                                             2                   ITA No.477/PUN/2017
                                                           M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates
    referred to the affidavit of the assessee dated 21-06-2018 explaining the
    delay. The contents of the said affidavit read as under :
           "5.    In this appeal before CIT(A) pertaining to A.Y. 2012-13 (subsequent
           assessment year) the directions were issued to A.O. to deny the
           deduction as explained above. It is undisputed fact and law that non-
           consideration of the judgment of Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal is the
           mistake apparent from records.          Accordingly the assessee filed
           application before Ld.CIT(A) under S.154 of the Act dt. 13-10-2016
           that is on the same date the appeal order of the Ld.CIT(A) was
           received. The Ld.CIT(A) did not decide the application u/s.154 one way
           or the other. The assessee perused the matter at his end but could not
           get any orders on the said application filed under S.154 of the Act.
           6.     The filing of application u/s.154 on the basis of appellate order of
           the Tribunal is also one legal forum and assessee was pursuing the same
           but was not successful. This is also considered a "reasonable cause" to
           condone the delay occurred in filing the appeal.
           7.     There is no intentional delay. The balance of convenience is in
           favour of the assessee.
           8.    In view of this it is prayed the delay be condoned and appeal be
           admitted for adjudication in accordance with the provisions of law."
    3.     On going through the contents of the affidavit and hearing the
    parties on this preliminary issue, we find it is a fact that assessee filed
    an application u/s.154 of the Act before the CIT(A) on the date of receipt
    of the order. It shows the seriousness of the assessee.                  He also
    undertook measures to follow it up with the O/o. the CIT(A) and they
    did not yield any result. It is not known why the said application of the
    assessee was not adjudicated by the CIT(A).            All these efforts of the
    assessee are undisputed by the revenue. On verification of the issue
    raised in the said application for rectification, we find the issue is linked
    to the issue raised in the grounds in this appeal. Assessee expected
    that the matter can be settled through the route of section 154 of the
    Act.   Therefore, assessee waited for the outcome of the proceedings
    u/s.154 of the Act, which caused the delay in filing of this appeal with
    the delay of 74 days. In our opinion, there is no fault on the assessee
    and the cause stated by the assessee constitutes reasonable cause.
    The CIT(A) ought to have disposed of the application of the assessee
                                            3                   ITA No.477/PUN/2017
                                                          M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates
    u/s.154 of the Act. Therefore, the delay of 74 days in filing the appeal
    before us is condonable and, therefore, the appeal is admitted for
    adjudication.   As such, the delay is only 2 ½ months and not years.
    Next, we shall take up the appeal on merits.
    4.    Grounds raised by the assessee are as under :
          "1.    On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the Hon'ble
          Tribunal "A" Bench Pune, in the case of the assessee
          (ITA/1709/PN/2014)decided on 29th Jan, 2015) A. Y. 2011-12 held that
          the amendments brought in S. 80IB(10) clause (e) and (f), inserted from
          01-04-2010 it was inconceivable as to how the amendment by finance
          Act, 2009 would be applied to the earlier concluded transactions? The
          objection of Revenue was held unsustainable. In the circumstances the
          Ld. CIT(A) was not justified in directing the A.O. to deny the deduction
          claimed u/s. 80IB(10) of the Act. The deduction claimed be allowed.
          2.     On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the Ld.
          CIT(A)'s order dt. 27-09-2016 was received on 13-10-2016. The appeal
          was required to be filed on or before 12-12-2016. The appeal is delayed.
          Immediately upon receipt of the order of the Ld. CIT(A) dt. 27-09-2016 the
          assessee filed the application under section 154 on 28-09-2016 pointing
          out certain mistakes in the said appeal order. The application remained
          undecided. The appellant assessee was pursuing the said application
          which caused delay in filing this appeal. The delay is for sufficient cause.
          The appellant would file separate application for condonation of delay
          supported by Sworn-affidavit. The delay be condoned.
          3.    The appellant craves to leave, add/amend or alter any of the
          above grounds of appeal."
    5.    Briefly stated relevant facts are that the assessee is a firm and is
    engaged in the business of Civil Construction. Assessee filed the return
    of income on 29-09-2012 declaring total income of Rs.4,25,620/-.
    During the year, assessee carried on three housing projects namely,
    Vishwasagar, Vishwanayan and Vishwa Enclave Apartments.                   Out of
    these projects, Vishwa Enclave Apartment is eligible for deduction
    u/s.80IB(10) of the Act.      Assessee maintained separate accounts for
    this project and claimed deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act for the
    assessment year under consideration at Rs.1,49,76,143/-.                      On
    verification of the details/records furnished by the assessee and on
    perusing the assessment order of the assessee for the earlier A.Y. 2011-
    12, the AO denied the claim of deduction made by the assessee.
                                             4                    ITA No.477/PUN/2017
                                                            M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates
    5.1   Background
facts relating to the denial of the said deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act
includes that the AO and CIT(A) denied the claim of the assessee. As per the
AO, the assessee (1) could not comply with the condition relating to built up
area of flats/units not exceeding 1500 sq.ft.; (2) the assessee could not
comply with the provisions of the only flat to one relative and, if fact, a
number of flats were sold to a number of relatives; and (3) assessee could not
comply with the provisions of completion of the project within 5 years from
the end of financial year in which the project was approved. Assessee carried
the matter to the Tribunal. The Tribunal vide ITA No.1709/PN/2014, dated
29-01-2015 for the A.Y. 2011-12 set-aside the order of CIT(A) and partly
allowed the appeal of the assessee. In the assessment proceedings, assessee
relied on the Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment in SLP No.7717 of 1990 in the
case of Union of India and others Vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. AIR
1992 Supreme Court 711, 712) 55 ELT 433 (S.C).
The Department is in the process of filing appeal before the Hon'ble High
Court, Mumbai u/s.260A of the Act. Eventually, the AO disallowed the claim of
deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act by holding as under :
> "10.1 With due respect towards ratios of higher ups discussed as above, very
> respectfully it is essential to state here that the decision of the H'ble
> Tribunal (supra) has been just received by the concerned jurisdictional AO
> and as such the decision is being analyzed in the light of the legal
> pronouncement and in the process of filing of appeal before the Hon. High
> Court, Mumbai u/s.260A of the Act. In order to keep the issue alive till it
> reaches its finality, as well as, to maintain consistency in appeal process;
> I am unable to allow the claim of assessee preferred u/s.80IB(10) of the
> Act; hence, the claim of assessee for deduction of Rs.1,49,76,143/- is
> hereby rejected, simultaneously initiating penal proceedings u/s.271(1)(c)
> of the Act, separately.
> 10.2 Endorsing the above issue relevant to deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the
> Act, further, it may also be stated here that the facts pointed out by my
> predecessor which led him to reject the claim of assessee firm for deduction
> made u/s.80IB(10) of the Act remain continued for the year under
> consideration too. Moreover, with due respect, it may be stated that, as far
> as, decision of the H'ble Apex Court relied upon by assessee  5 ITA
> No.477/PUN/2017 M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates is concerned, it is
> distinguishable on facts, because on different set of facts relevant to the
> provisions of Central Excise and Customs Act and in the different
> perspective that matter has been decided by the H'ble Supreme Court."
6\. In the appellate proceedings before the CIT(A), assessee's Counsel
submitted that the issue is covered by virtue of the order of Tribunal for
A.Y. 2011-12. On the first objection that some of the flats exceeded the
specified area of 1500 sq.ft., the CIT(A) after considering the contents of
Para Nos. 15 to 17 of the order of Tribunal for the A.Y. 2011-12 (supra) held
as under :
> "8. From the above, it is evident that the proportionate profits of only
> those residential units in the project which comply with the requirement of
> clause (c) of section 80IB(10) are to be allowed as a deduction. In other
> words, the disallowance of deduction shall be limited to profits relating to
> those units which exceed the area of limitation of 1500 sq.ft. It has been
> submitted before me that during the year no such units were sold and,
> therefore, there is no question of any proportionate disallowance.
> Nevertheless, the AO is directed to verify if at all any of the units for
> which sales have been recognized during the year exceed 1500 sq.ft. of
> built-up area (as defined u/s.80IB(10)) and if so, deny the benefit of
> deduction on the profits from those units alone.
6.1 Regarding the second objection that assessee sold more than one flat to
the same buyer/relative of the buyer, the CIT(A) after consider the contents
of Para No.7 and 8 of the order of Tribunal (supra) held as under :
> "9................... From the details filed before me, I find that there
> are only two such transactions wherein flats have been sold to near
> relatives viz. flat no.101 and 102 in 'A' wing to Ms. L.H. Shah and Mrs.
> H.M. Shah (date of sale deed - 30/3/2012) and the second instance being
> flats No.408 and 409 to Mrs. M.R. Somani and Mrs. R.V. Somani (date of sale
> agreement - 29/01/2010). Following the decision of the Hon'ble Tribunal, it
> is apparent that only flats No.101 and 102 in 'A' wing are hit by the
> provisions of clause (f) of section 80IB(10). The AO is therefore, directed
> to deny the deduction u/s.80IB(10) to the profits from flats No.101 and 102
> of the 'A' wing." (Para 9 of the CIT(A).
6.2 Regarding the third objection for denial of deduction that the project was
not complete as on 31-03-2012, the CIT(A) after considering the contents of
Para No.13 of the Tribunal (supra) held as under :
6 ITA No.477/PUN/2017
> M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates " It is evident from the above that the project
> is complete as on 31/03/2011 and therefore, eligible for a deduction
> u/s.80IB(10). Based on the discussion above, ground No.1 is partly allowed
> in view of my specific directions in paragraph 8 directing the assessing
> officer to verify if any of the flats sold during the year exceed the area
> limit of 1500 sq.ft. as also my specific direction in paragraph 9 directing
> the assessing officer to deny deduction under section 80IB to profits from 2
> flats, viz 101 and 102 in the 'A' wing of the project." (Para 10 of the
> CIT(A).
Eventually, the CIT(A) partly allowed the appeal of the assessee. In the
process, the order of Tribunal stands dishonoured in the disguise of keeping
the issue alive as mentioned by the AO in Para No.10.1 of his order.
7\. Aggrieved with the part relief given by the CIT(A), the assessee is in
appeal before us with the grounds extracted above.
8\. We have heard both the sides and perused the orders of the revenue
authorities. On going through the facts, submissions and the orders of the
revenue as well as the order of Pune Bench of the Tribunal in the assessee's
own case in ITA No.1709/PN/2014, dated 29-01-2015 for the A.Y. 2011-12, we
find the Tribunal answered all the objections raised by the AO in favour of
the assessee. Therefore, we find it relevant to the extract the finding given
by the Tribunal and the same reads as under :
> "6. However, assessee submitted that the flats in question were allotted to
> the spouses of the individual who were already allotted a flat in the said
> project prior to the insertion of such restriction in section 80-IB(10) of
> the Act. The claim of the assessee was that it has allotted the said flats
> in the month of October, 2008 and the sale agreements were duly registered
> in October, 2008 itself. Notably, the restriction contained in sub-clauses
> (e) and (f) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act relating to the limit of
> allotment of not more than one residential unit in the housing project to
> the related persons specified therein, was inserted by the Finance (No.2)
> Act, 2009 w.e.f. 01.04.2010. On this basis, the stand of the assessee before
> the lower authorities as well as before us is that the aforesaid allotment
> of flats made in October, 2008 is not hit by the said restriction which has
> come on the statute on a later date.
7\. We find that the Assessing Officer has not disputed the assertions of the
assessee that the aforesaid flats were sold to the said parties in the month
of October, 2008 and the sale agreements were duly registered in  7 ITA
No.477/PUN/2017 M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates October, 2008. However, as per
the Assessing Officer, there were certain number of unsold flats shown in
Work-in-Progress and there was a possibility that the assessee may even after
01.04.2010 sell flats to the relatives of the persons already holding the
flats. The Assessing Officer also disagreed with the assessee that the
provisions inserted by the Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 w.e.f. 01.04.2010 were not
applicable to the flats which already stood sold by the assessee in October,
2008. The aforesaid stand of the Assessing Officer has also been affirmed by
the CIT(A).
8\. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid stand of the Revenue is quite
indefensible. Quite clearly, the restriction on allotment of flats to the
relatives and other specified persons contained in sub-clause (e) and (f) to
section 80- IB(10) of the Act have been inserted by the Finance (No.2) Act,
2009 w.e.f. 01.04.2010. The objection of the Assessing Officer on the
allotment of flats and it's sale to the spouses of the individual who were
already holding flats in the project, is relating to the period October, 2008
i.e. a period much prior to the amendment brought by Finance (No.2) Act, 2009
w.e.f. 01.04.2010. It is inconceivable as to how the amendment by way of
insertion of sub-clause (e) and (f) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act made by
Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 is being applied for an earlier concluded
transaction, as there is no provision for retrospectively applying the
amendment. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the said objection by the
Revenue is unsustainable. We hold so.
9\. Another objection raised by the Assessing Officer was based on clause
(a) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act, which was to the effect that the assessee
did not complete construction of the project within the stipulated date. The
relevant facts in this regard are as follows. The project of the assessee
consisted of A, B and C Wings. The project was approved by the local authority
i.e. Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on 27.10.2005. As a consequence, in
terms of sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act, the
assessee was required to complete the construction of the project within 5
years from the entire of the financial year in which it was approved by the
local authority. Therefore, the stipulated dated for completion of the
construction of the project was 31.03.2011. In the background of the aforesaid
legal position, assessee canvassed before the Assessing Officer that the
completion certificate for the A and B Wing was issued by the local authority
on 26.03.2010 and for the C Wing it was issued on 25.03.2011. On this basis,
it was canvassed that the construction of the project was completed within the
stipulated date contained in clause (a) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act.
10\. The Assessing Officer, however, did not accept the plea of the assessee
by making the following discussion :-
> "In this connection, it may be reiterated that the assessee himself
> submitted that there was closing work in progress of the flats of the units
> bearing numbers 104, 208, 310 and 703 which the assessee pleaded of having
> less than 1500 sq.fts. in each unit of its built-up area, though in the
> initial submission such built-up area of each such unit was specified by the
> assessee for more than 1500 sq.fts.. When there were incomplete units/flats
> as admitted by the assessee itself, it cannot be said that the project was
> completed. As far as for getting the benefit of deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of
> the Act, the project for which the approval was taken for commencement is
> required to be completed in full. Part completion of the project, even if
> the certificate of completion has been obtained from the Municipal
> Authority, when the assessee itself admitted that there were incomplete
> units left/kept as work- in-progress, it cannot be said that the project was
> completed and the condition of completion of the project as laid down in
> section  8 ITA No.477/PUN/2017 M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates 80-IB(10) of the
> Act was fulfilled. As such, the assessee's contention that the project was
> completed prior to 31.03.2011 is also not acceptable and hence the same is
> not accepted."
11\. The aforesaid discussion reveals that as per the Assessing Officer, there
were certain flats lying in closing work-in-progress as on 31.03.2011 and
therefore he did not accept assessee's plea that the construction of the
project was complete.
12\. In this context, the Ld. Representative for the assessee submitted that
the completion certificates issued by the local authority demonstrated that
the construction of the project was complete within the stipulated date and
that assessee has complied with the requirements of clause (a) to section 80-
IB(10) of the Act.
13\. We have considered the objection raised by the lower authorities and find
that the same is untenable in the eyes of law. Firstly, it is not in dispute
that the completion certificates issued by the local authority are evidencing
the completion of construction within the stipulated date. In- fact,
Explanation (ii) below section 80-IB(10)(a) of the Act suggests that the date
of completion of construction of housing project shall be taken to be the date
on which the completion certificate in respect of housing project is issued by
the local authority. In the present case, the said certificates have been
issued within the date stipulated by way of clause
(a) to 80-IB(10) of the Act. Apart therefrom, factually there is no evidence
lead down by the Assessing Officer to demonstrate that the construction of the
project was not complete. The Ld. Representative for the assessee pointed out
that the objection of the Assessing Officer was based on the unsold flats
lying in Work-in-Progress. It was pointed out that the objection of the
Assessing Officer is based on mere surmises and conjectures. In our considered
opinion, the reference made by the Assessing Officer to closing work-in-
progress of certain flats to say that the project was incomplete is quite
irrelevant. In the Balance Sheet, assessee has shown a number of unsold flats
as work-in-progress. The unsold flats do not signify non-completion of the
construction of the project and therefore, in our view, the said objection
raised by the Assessing Officer is quite irrelevant in the context of
examining the compliance of clause (a) to 80-IB(10) of the Act. The assessee
has fulfilled the requirement of clause (a) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act on
the basis of the completion certificates issued by the local authority. We
hold so.
14\. The third and the last objection raised by the Assessing Officer was
based on clause (c) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act. Clause (c) restricts the
built-up area of the residential unit for the project in question at a maximum
of 1500 sq.ft.. As per the Assessing Officer, the built-up area of some of the
flats in the project exceeded the limit of 1500 sq.ft. and therefore he held
that the project of the assessee was not eligible for the deduction u/s
80-IB(10) of the Act.
15\. Before us, the Ld. Representative for the assessee submitted that for
four of the flats, the Assessing Officer erroneously took the built-up area as
being in excess of 1500 sq.ft. based on their carpet area and not the covered
area of each of the individual flats. For the other three units, the Ld.
Representative submitted that as regards one of the flats namely flat no. 601,
the same was not included in the profit calculated for the purposes of
deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act. Another flat no. 702 was unsold and was
included in the closing stock. Nevertheless, it is conceded by the Ld.
Representative that the said three flats comprised of a built-up area in
excess of 1500 sq.ft.. The plea of the appellant before us is that merely
because of some flats are in excess of 1500 sq.ft., it would not result in
wholesale denial of deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act on the entire project.
The Ld. Representative submitted that the profits  9 ITA No.477/PUN/2017 M/s.
V.S. Joshi & Associates relatable to the units which have a built-up area of
upto 1500 sq.ft. be allowed deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act. In other
words, the Ld. Representative contended that proportionate relief be allowed
u/s 80- IB(10) of the Act qua the profits relating to flats which comply with
the requirements of clause (c) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act. The said stand
of the assessee is supported by the judgement of the Hon'ble Calcutta High
Court in the case of CIT vs. Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd., (IT
Appeal No.458 of 2006) dated 05.01.2007.
16\. The Ld. Departmental Representative has also not disputed that the Pune
Bench of the Tribunal has been consistently allowing proportionate relief in
cases where some of the flats do not comply with the requirements of clause
(c) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act inasmuch as the profits relatable to the
residential units which comply with the requirements of clause (c) to section
80-IB(10) of the Act have been held to be eligible for deduction.
17\. In view of the aforesaid precedent, in our view, the lower authorities
were not justified in denying the deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act on a
wholesale basis by noticing that few of the flats in the project do not comply
with the limit on built-up area prescribed by clause (c) to section 80-IB(10)
of the Act. The order of the CIT(A) is set-aside and the Assessing Officer is
directed to re-compute the deduction allowable u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act on the
basis of the profits proportionate to residential units in the project which
comply with the requirement of clause (c) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act. The
disallowance of deduction u/s 80-IB(10) of the Act shall be limited to the
profits relating to those units which exceed the maximum built-up area of 1500
sq.ft. prescribed in clause (c) to section 80-IB(10) of the Act. We hold so.
18\. In this manner, on Grounds of Appeal No.1 & 2, assessee partly succeeds.
Therefore, in principle, the issues stand covered in favour of the assessee.
Hence, all the grounds on merits are allowed in favour of the assessee.
9\. Before parting with the order, we find it relevant to observe that AO and
the CIT(A) made their orders on 30-03-2015 and 27-09-2016 respectively.
Further, the order of the Tribunal for A.Y.
2011-12 (supra) being dated 29-01-2015, is in existence at the relevant point
of time. Therefore, it is an undisputed fact that the AO/CIT(A) has not
followed the decision of the jurisdictional Tribunal in assessee's own case
for the A.Y. 2011-12 intentionally. The principles of judicial discipline
demand that the orders of the higher appellate authorities should be followed
unreservedly by the lower authorities. The reasons  10 ITA No.477/PUN/2017
M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates given by the AO, i.e. "in order to keep the issue
alive till it reaches its finality, as well as, to maintain consistency in
appeal process; I am unable to allow the claim of assessee preferred
u/s.80IB(10) of the Act"
is no ground for not following the order of Tribunal. In this connection, we
wish to refer to the decision of Visakhapatnam Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of Cargo Handling Private Workers Pool vs DCIT in ITA No 152 to 156/
Vizag/2011 wherein it was held that the orders passed by the Tribunal are
binding on all the tax authorities functioning under the jurisdiction of
Tribunal. The operational paras of the order of the Tribunal (supra) is
extracted as under :
"Next we shall dwell upon the judicial rulings about the binding nature of
orders passed by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal. The Hon'ble MP High Court
in the case Agarwal Warehousing and Leasing Ltd. Vs. CIT (257 ITR
235) has held that the orders passed by the tribunal are binding on all the
tax authorities functioning under the jurisdiction of the tribunal. While so
holding, it followed the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
UOI Vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd (AIR 1992 Supreme Court 711,
712) 55 ELT 433 (S.C) which has ruled as under:
"It cannot be too vehemently emphasized that it is of utmost importance that,
in disposing of the quasi-judicial issues before them, revenue officers are
bound by the decisions of appellate authorities. The order of the Appellate
collector is binding on the Assistant Collectors working within his
jurisdiction and the order of the Tribunal is binding upon the Assistant
Collectors and the Appellate Collectors who function under the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal. The principles of judicial discipline require that the orders of
the higher appellate authorities should be followed unreservedly by the
subordinate authorities. The mere fact that the order of the appellate
authority is not "acceptable" to the Department - in itself an objectionable
phrase - and is the subject matter of an appeal can furnish no ground for not
following it unless its operation has been suspended by a competent court. If
this healthy rule is not followed, the result will only be undue harassment to
the assessees and chaos in administration of tax laws".
The Hon'ble M.P High Court further observed in clear terms as under:
"Obviously, the Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals) not only committed
judicial impropriety but also erred in law in refusing to follow the order of
the Appellate Tribunal. Even where he may have some reservations about the
correctness of the decision of the Tribunal, he had to follow the order. He
could and should have left it to the Department to take the matter in further
appeal to the Tribunal and get the mistake, if any, rectified."
Further in Khalid Automobiles Vs. UOI (1995) (4 SCC (Suppl.) 652), the Hon'ble
Apex Court held that an order of Tribunal was binding on the Assessing officer
and the first appellate authority and the failure to follow the same may
constitute contempt of Tribunal's order. Similar views have been expressed in
Sales tax matters in  11 ITA No.477/PUN/2017 M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates
Rajendra Mills ltd Vs. Jt. CIT (1971) 28 STC 483 (Mad), Senthil Raj Metals Vs.
GTO (1990) 79 STC 38 (Mad).
Therefore, we are of the opinion that it is a case of dishonouring the order
of the jurisdiction Tribunal. The supervisory authorities of the AO and the
CIT(A) may consider taking appropriate action in respect of such officers as
per the procedure. Accordingly, we allow the grounds raised by the assessee.
10\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed.

          This is the appeal filed by the assessee against the order of

    13.
    2.    Condonation of delay : Before us, Ld. Counsel for the assessee
    submitted that there was delay of 74 in filing the appeal before the
    Tribunal. It was submitted that assessee filed an application u/s.154 of

    referred to the affidavit of the assessee dated 21-06-2018 explaining the
    delay. The contents of the said affidavit read as under :
           "5.    In this appeal before CIT(A) pertaining to A.Y. 2012-13 (subsequent
           assessment year) the directions were issued to A.O. to deny the
           deduction as explained above. It is undisputed fact and law that non-
           consideration of the judgment of Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal is the
           mistake apparent from records.          Accordingly the assessee filed
           application before Ld.CIT(A) under S.154 of the Act dt. 13-10-2016
           that is on the same date the appeal order of the Ld.CIT(A) was

                                                           M/s. V.S. Joshi & Associates
    referred to the affidavit of the assessee dated 21-06-2018 explaining the
    delay. The contents of the said affidavit read as under :
           "5.    In this appeal before CIT(A) pertaining to A.Y. 2012-13 (subsequent
           assessment year) the directions were issued to A.O. to deny the
           deduction as explained above. It is undisputed fact and law that non-
           consideration of the judgment of Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal is the
           mistake apparent from records.          Accordingly the assessee filed
           application before Ld.CIT(A) under S.154 of the Act dt. 13-10-2016
           that is on the same date the appeal order of the Ld.CIT(A) was
           received. The Ld.CIT(A) did not decide the application u/s.154 one way
           or the other. The assessee perused the matter at his end but could not
per the procedure. Accordingly, we allow the grounds raised by the assessee.
10\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on this 18th day of July, 2018\.
