    4.S.A.Nawabkhan (A4)
    5.B.Basith @ Mohammed Basith (A5)
have also done so in detail. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the
examination of witnesses in a random manner and without the presence of the
Accused have not caused any prejudice to the Accused.
27\. We also found that apart from the reasons given in paragraph Nos. 23 and
24 of the impugned judgment, the trial Court has taken into consideration all
the relevant facts and circumstances and chosen to award sentence of
imprisonment against the Respondents 1 to 43. This Court has also
independently considered the submissions made on behalf of the Revision
Petitioners and also perused the testimonies of the concerned witnesses. We
find that the trial Court has properly appreciated the testimonies of
witnesses and has recorded sound and tenable reasons for awarding the sentence
of imprisonment against the said Respondents.
28\. In our considered opinion, the discretion exercised by the trial Court,
in awarding sentence of imprisonment cannot set to be arbitrary or
unreasonable.
29\. This Court finds no error apparent on the face of the record, illegality

5\. In the present revision the revision petitioners who are some of the
witnesses examined by the prosecution, pray for enhancement of sentence
awarded to the Respondents 1 to 43.
6\. The trial Court in paragraph Nos. 21 to 25 of its judgment, has recorded
the reasons as to why it has not imposed the capital sentence.
" 21.All these details have already been communicated in a signed memorandum
submitted by a group of the accused to the Honble High Court in the
memorandum. Hence this court considers that in the given circumstances the
interests of the accused have not been fully, properly and absolutely
safeguarded by proper legal assistance to all the accused. Under such
situation and circumstances this court with the available materials have
concluded and pronounced the judgement and this court earnestly believes and
apprehends that had the legal assistance been properly utilized more details
and facts would have come to light in assisting this court to find out the
truth. Therefore this court considers this issue as the mitigating factor in
favour of the accused.
22.Apart from this factor this court has found out that there had been
prejudices on the part of accused which are stated in detail hereunder. That
no accused of the 166 accused were granted bail during the trial proceedings
to enable them to effectively defend the charges against them. This has
deprived them from gathering adequate material which would of any legal
support to their plea. Huge volume of records and materials to unimaginable
levels have compelled them to curtail certain rights bestowed to them under
law. Emergence of factions and groups inside the prison during their prolonged
incarceration, under the leadership of A-1 S.A.Basha, A-2 Mohamed Ansari,a
group formed by the A-65 to 100 and a separate group not belonging to these
three groups amongst the accused resulted a great damage and prejudice in
shaping their defense, conduct of the trial proceedings and choosing of
lawyers.
23.Apart from that, the schedule of the examination of the witnesses in a
random manner without giving adequate time to the defense to prepare
themselves to defend them has also caused prejudice. Besides the examination
of the corroborative witnesses on different occasions and conduct of the cross
examinations also on different occasions also have caused prejudice to the
plea of the defense.
24.Many witnesses had been examined in the absence of the connected or
concerned accused while they had been produced before any other court for
other cases had also caused prejudice to the concerned accused. Besides
conflict of interest amongst the accused themselves in their defense has also
caused prejudice to their plea of defense. Finally knowingly or inadvertently,
admissions made by the learned counsels during the cross examination also has
caused prejudice to the case of the accused.
25.These various factors drive this court to come to a decision to decline
from ordering capital sentence despite the fact that the nature of the crime
committed would attract no less of a death penalty. Therefore these
circumstances and factors outweigh the legal ingredients for the awarding of
the death penalty. There cannot be any mercy to be shown to these accused
since their cruel act of the commission of this crime goes beyond all horizons
and purview of mercy. Therefore this court would invoke the maximum prescribed
sentences contemplated for those penal provisions with which the accused have
been charged. "
7\. The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioners has placed
reliance upon the following judgments:-
1\. 1970 (3) SCC page 493 - Ram Narain and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh;
2\. (1983) 3 SCC 470 - Machhi Singh and others vs. State of Punjab;
3\. (1987) 3 SCC page 80 - Mahesh vs. State of Madhya Pradesh;
4\. (1991) 3 SCC page 471- Sevakaperumal vs State of Tamil Nadu;
5\. (2002) 7 SCC page 334 - Mohd.Khalid vs. State of West Bengal;
8\. It is the submission of the learned counsel appearing for the revision
petitioner that the gravity of the offences is very grave in nature and it has
been committed with a calculative mind of taking revenge on the innocent
public especially the people belonging to Hindu community by planting and
exploding bombs at 12 places in Coimbatore which resulted in the death of so
many innocent persons and causing extensive damages to the public and private
property. The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner would
further contend that the courts while awarding the sentence, would alive not
only the right of criminals but also the right of the victims of the crime and
to see that the accused are appropriately punished so as to act as a
deterrent. It is also the submission of the learned counsel appearing for the
revision petitioners that the brutal murder of 58 innocent persons and
injuring more than 250 persons would no doubtly fall in the category of rarest
of rare cases attracting capital punishment and trial Court without issuing
any proper and cogent reasons, has chosen to award only the sentence of
imprisonment ranging to various terms.
9\. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the trial
court has taken into consideration the various aspects and also awarded the
sentence of imprisonment and the scope of this court in exercise of revisional
power to enhance the sentence is very much limited.
10\. This court has considered the submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing for the revision petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor.
11\. The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner would submit
that the offence committed by the accused are heinous and grave in nature and
it is a clearly case of a terrorist Act. Therefore, no sympathy of any sort
ought to have been shown to them and the capital sentence would meet the ends
of justice and which would some what heal the wounds of the persons who were
affected due to the serial bomb blasts.
12\. The attention of this Court was drawn to the judgment of Machhi Singh and
others vs. State of Punjab, reported in 1983(3) SCC page 470 wherein, it has
been held as follows:-
" The following questions may be asked and answered as a test to determine the
'rarest' of 'rare' case in which death sentence can be inflicted:
(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of
imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?
(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but
to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the
mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?
The following guidelines which emerge from Bachan Singh case1 will have to be
applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposition
of death sentence arises:
(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases
of extreme culpability.
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender
also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of
the crime.
(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In
other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears
to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant
circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to
impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised
having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the
relevant circumstances.
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be
drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full
weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the
mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.
Bachan Singh vs. State of Pubjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684: 1980 SCC (Cri) 580: AIR
1980 SC 898 : 1980 Crl. LJ 636, explained.
In rarest of rare cases when the collective conscience of the community is so
shocked, that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to
inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards
desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty, death sentence can be
awarded. The community may entertain such a sentiment in the following
circumstances:
(1) When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque,
diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme
indignation of the community.
(2) When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity
and meanness; e.g. murder by hired assassin commits murder for the sake of
money or reward, or cold-blooded murder for gains of a person vis-a-vis whom
the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust; or murder
is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland.
(3) When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or minority community etc.,
is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social
wrath; or in cases of bride burning or dowry deaths or when murder is
committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or
to marry another woman on account of infatuation.
(4) When the crime is enormous in proportion. For instance when multiple
murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of
persons of a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed.
(5) When the victim of murder is an innocent child, or a helpless woman or old
or infirm person or a person vis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating
position, or a public figure generally loved and respected by the community.
If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of
the aforesaid propositions and taking into account the answers to the
questions posed by way of the test for the rarest of rare case, the
circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court
would proceed to do so".
13\. In (1987) 3 SCC 80 - Mahesh v. State of M.P., it has been held that:
"It will be a mockery of justice to permit these appellants to escape the
extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts. To
give the lesser punishment for the appellants would be to render the justicing
system of this country suspect. The common man will lose faith in courts. In
such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more
than the reformative jargon. When we say this, we do not ignore the need for a
reformative approach in the sentencing process. But here, we have no
alternative but to confirm the death sentence".
14\. In 1991 (3) SCC page 471 - Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N, the facts of
the case is that innocent boys from affluent families were taken to far flung
places and they were murdered and 4 murders in a span of 5 years were
committed for gain in cold-blooded, in a premeditated and planned way. The
Sessions Court imposed death sentences which was conformed by this Court and
as against that appeal was preferred before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
and it has been held as follows:-
" There is no infirmity in the sentence awarded by the Sessions Court and
confirmed by the High Court warranting interference. The facts would establish
his depravity and hardened criminality of the accused. No regard for precious
lives of innocent young boys was shown. They adopted the crime of murder for
gain as a means of living. The compassionate grounds such as the accused are
young men and breadwinners of their family consisting of a young wife, minor
child and aged parents would always be present in most cases and are not
relevant for interference.
Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice
system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society
could not long endure under serious threats. If the courts did not protect the
injured, the injured would then resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore,
the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature
of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. The
law regulates social interests, arbitrates conflicting claims and demands.
Security of persons and property of the people is an essential function of the
State. It could be achieved through instrumentality of criminal law.
Undoubtedly, there is a cross-cultural conflict where living law must find
answer to the new challenges and the courts are required to mould the
sentencing system to meet the challenges. The contagion of lawlessness would
undermine social order and lay it in ruins. Protection of society and stamping
out criminal proclivity must be the object of law which must be achieved by
imposing appropriate sentence. Therefore, law as a cornerstone of the edifice
of order should meet the challenges confronting the society. Friedman in his
Law in Changing Society stated that, State of criminal law continues to be 
as it should be  a decisive reflection of social consciousness of society.
Therefore, in operating the sentencing system, law should adopt the corrective
machinery or the deterrence based on factual matrix. By deft modulation of
sentencing process be stern where it should be, and tempered with mercy where
it warrants to be. The facts and given circumstances in each case, the nature
of the crime, the manner in which it was planned and committed, the motive for
commission of the crime, the conduct of the accused and all other attending
circumstances are relevant facts which would enter into the area of
consideration. For instance a murder committed due to deep seated personal
rivalry may not call for penalty of death. But an organised crime or mass
murders of innocent people would call for imposition of death sentence as
deterrence".
15\. The learned counsel also placed reliance upon the judgment reported in
2002 (7) SCC page 334-Mohammad Kalid vs. State of West Bengal, which arose at
the prosecution under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act,
1987. The facts of the said case are that on 16.3.1993, due to bomb blast in
Bow Bazaar area of Calcutta a building was totally demolished/crumbled and
there was a partial crumbling down of two other adjacent buildings which
resulted in trapping of number of people in which replaces and the large
number of have been died. The accused were found guilty and convicted under
various provisions of TADA and IPC and appeals were preferred before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India considered
the meaning of terrorism and held as follows:-
"Terrorism is one of the manifestations of increased lawlessness and cult of
violence. Violence and crime constitute a threat to an established order and
are a revolt against a civilised society. Terrorism has not been defined
under TADA nor is it possible to give a precise definition of terrorism or
lay down what constitutes terrorism. It may be possible to describe it as
use of violence when its most important result is not merely the physical and
mental damage of the victim but the prolonged psychological effect it produces
or has the potential of producing on the society as a whole. There may be
death, injury, or destruction of property or even deprivation of individual
liberty in the process but the extent and reach of the intended terrorist
activity travels beyond the effect of an ordinary crime capable of being
punished under the ordinary penal law of the land and its main objective is to
overawe the Government or disturb the harmony of the society or terrorise
people and the society and not only those directly assaulted, with a view to
disturb the even tempo, peace and tranquillity of the society and create a
sense of fear and insecurity. Whether the criminal act was committed with an
intention to strike terror in the people or a section of the people would
depend upon the facts of each case. For finding out the intention of the
accused, there would hardly be a few cases where there would be direct
evidence. It has to be mainly inferred from the circumstances of each case.
Jayawant Dattatray Suryarao v. State of Maharashtra (2001)10 SCC 109 : 2002
SCC (Cri) 897 : Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs. State of Maharashtra, (1994) 4 SCC
602: 1994 SCC (Cri) 1087, relied on League of Nations Convention (1937),
relied on The preparation of bombs and possession of bombs would tantamount to
terrorizing the people. Credible evidence proves it to be a terrorist act. The
explosion of a large number of live bombs is a clear indication of conspiracy.
It was further held that it cannot be contended that if the bombs are for
self-defence there was no mens rea. Preparation and storage of bombs are per
se illegal acts.
The right of self-defence commences not before a reasonable apprehension
arises in the mind of the accused. right is not available if there is
sufficient time for recourse to a public authority. Here there was no evidence
that there was any indication about an attack on the Muslims and, therefore,
the question of any reasonable apprehension does not arise. The cover of self-
protection when pierced unravels a sinister design to unleash terror. There
was no scope for inferring the so-called view of the accused persons that the
police may not help them. That occasion had not arisen".
16\. The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner would submit
that the serial bomb blasts at Coimbatore was purely a terrorist act which
resulted in death of large number of peoples and injuries to so many persons
and extensive damage to private and public properties and therefore, the trial
Court should have awarded the death penalty to the accused/Respondents 1 to
43.
17\. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners had also drawn the
attention of this Court to the following judgments:
1\. 2002 (7) SCC 39 - Tarun Bora alias Alok Hazarika vs. State of Assam;
2\. 2003 (8) SCC 461- Nazir Khan v. State of Delhi
3\. 2004 (4) SCC 622- Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar
4\. 2005(2) SCC 409 - Prakash Kumar @ Prakash Bhutto vs. State of Gujarat.
18\. 2002 (7) SCC 39- Tarun Bora alias Alok Hazarika vs. State of Assam
pertains to the prosecution in TADA of cadre belonging to Ulfa of Assam
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken into consideration the
gravity of the offences and not accepted the plea of the appellant/accused for
leniency.
19\. 2003(8) SCC 461 - Nazir Khan v. State of Delhi, also pertains to the
prosecution under TADA. The facts of the case are that the foreigners were
kidnapped for ransom so as to pressurise the Indian Government to release some
dreaded militants confined in the jails of India and the designated court has
awarded life sentence and challenging the legality of the same appeals were
preferred before the Apex Court. The Apex Court while sustaining the
conviction and sentence, has also considered the proportionality of the
sentence and held as follows:
"The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality in
prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal
conduct. It ordinarily allows some significant discretion to the Judge in
arriving at a sentence that reflects more subtle considerations of culpability
that are raised by the special facts of each case. Punishment ought always to
fit with the crime".
20\. 2004(4) SCC 622- Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar also pertains to the
prosecution and conviction under Tada Act and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
considered the meaning of the word terrorism.
21\. The sum and substance of the submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing for the revision petitioner is that since accused committed by the
respondents 1 to 43 who were admittedly terrorist Act, the trial Court has
committed a grave error in imposing only sentence of imprisonment and it is
not in commensurate with the gravity of the offence and therefore, prayed for
enhancement of sentence to one of capital punishment.
22\. This Court has carefully considered the submissions made by the
respective counsel for the Respondents and the State also. Under Sub-section
(2) of Section 386 of Cr.P.C., this Court is having power to enhance a
sentence so as to alter its nature. Sentence being a matter of discretion is
well settled and when discretion has been properly exercised along accepted
judicial lines, the appellate Court should not interfere to the detriment of
the accused, except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed in the
judgment. Interference will be justified only when the sentence is manifestly
inadequate or unduly lenient in the particular circumstance of a case or when
the failure to impose a proper sentence may result in miscarriage of justice.
The said proposition has been laid down in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India reported in AIR 1955 Supreme Court page 778 : AIR 1973 SC 467-
Bedraj vs. State of U.P.
23\. In AIR 1959 SC page 144-Pranabkumar Mitra Vs. State of W.B., it has been
held that the power of interference in exercise of revisional jurisdiction in
the matter of sentence is discretionary. Keeping the said principles in mind,
this Court has considered the reasons assigned by the trial Court while
awarding sentence of imprisonment. It is to be noted at this juncture the
State has not preferred any appeal for enhancement and in fact, not preferred
appeal in respect of acquittal of some of the accused also. The trial of the
case was very long drawn affair and during trial, none of the accused were
enlarged on bail. In fact at the time of pronouncement of the judgment, some
of the accused had already undergone the period of imprisonment awarded by the
trial Court. The said fact is also an important factor to be taken into
consideration while awarding capital punishment.
24\. In the decision reported in 1913 (Vol.14) Lucknow 401-, it has been held
that the High Court has power to enhance the sentence of an accused on the
application of a private person, but it should not entertain the application
by private parties for enhancement of sentence as Courts should not be allowed
to become tools in the hands of members of different community giving vent to
their private vengeance. The present Revision is preferred by some of the
witnesses and the possibility of private vengeance cannot be ruled out as held
in the above cited decision.
25\. Though the trial Court in paragraph Nos.23 and 24 of its Judgment has
recorded the reasons regarding the examination of the witnesses in a random
manner without giving adequate time to the Defence to prepare themselves to
defend the Accused, which resulted in prejudice and that the examination of
witnesses in the absence of Accused, had also caused prejudice, we are not
inclined to accept the same for the following reasons.
26\. A perusal of the testimonies of witnesses would disclose that the
respective counsel appearing for the Accused had cross-examined the witnesses
in detail and they have been granted time whenever they required to cross-
examine the witnesses. The applications filed by them for deferment of cross-
examination were entertained by the trial Court and the Defence Counsel were
given fullest opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and they
have also done so in detail. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the
examination of witnesses in a random manner and without the presence of the
Accused have not caused any prejudice to the Accused.
27\. We also found that apart from the reasons given in paragraph Nos. 23 and
24 of the impugned judgment, the trial Court has taken into consideration all
the relevant facts and circumstances and chosen to award sentence of
imprisonment against the Respondents 1 to 43. This Court has also
independently considered the submissions made on behalf of the Revision
Petitioners and also perused the testimonies of the concerned witnesses. We
find that the trial Court has properly appreciated the testimonies of
witnesses and has recorded sound and tenable reasons for awarding the sentence
of imprisonment against the said Respondents.
28\. In our considered opinion, the discretion exercised by the trial Court,
in awarding sentence of imprisonment cannot set to be arbitrary or
unreasonable.
29\. This Court finds no error apparent on the face of the record, illegality
or infirmity in the discretion exercised by the trial Court while awarding the
sentence of imprisonment to the above said accused. Therefore, this revision
is dismissed.

Accused have not caused any prejudice to the Accused.
27\. We also found that apart from the reasons given in paragraph Nos. 23 and
24 of the impugned judgment, the trial Court has taken into consideration all
the relevant facts and circumstances and chosen to award sentence of
imprisonment against the Respondents 1 to 43. This Court has also
independently considered the submissions made on behalf of the Revision
Petitioners and also perused the testimonies of the concerned witnesses. We
find that the trial Court has properly appreciated the testimonies of
witnesses and has recorded sound and tenable reasons for awarding the sentence
of imprisonment against the said Respondents.
28\. In our considered opinion, the discretion exercised by the trial Court,
in awarding sentence of imprisonment cannot set to be arbitrary or
unreasonable.
29\. This Court finds no error apparent on the face of the record, illegality
