PER BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER Present cross appeals has been filed by
revenue as well as assessee against final assessment order under section
143(3) read with section 144C(13) of the Act, dated 18/01/2016 passed by
Ld.DCIT Circle 1(1)(2) on following grounds of appeal: ITA No. 482/B/2016
(revenue appeal)
1\. The order of the Dispute Resolution panel is opposed to law and the facts
and circumstances of the case.
Software development services segment
2\. The DRP erred in directing the AO/TPO to exclude M/s. Acropetal
Technologies Ltd. and M/s. Larsen & Toubro InfoTech Ltd. from the list of
comparables, holding them to be functionally dissimilar as they are having
significant onsite revenues, thereby seeking exact comparability while
searching for comparable companies of the assessee under TNMM method, whereas
requirement of law and international jurisprudence require seeking similar
comparable companies. Also, the nature of activity, i.e. software development
remains the same, irrespective of the company engaged in providing onsite
offshore services.
3\. The DRP erred in directing the AO to exclude M/s. Larsen & Toubro infoTech
Ltd.. and MIs. Acropetal Technologies Ltd,. on the ground that they have
significant onsite revenue, without appreciating the fact that onsite
developments of software entails more cost and thereby results in power profit
margins.
4\. The DRP erred in directing the AO to exclude M/s. Acropetal Technologies
Ltd., from the list of final comparable also for the reason that clear
segmental information of the employee cost was not available. Without
appreciating that proper segmental information was available on prowess
database as well audited finials.
Page 3 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017
5\. The DRP erred in directing to exclude E-infochips Ltd, from the list of
comparables holding these no segmental information is available and that it
fails 75% services revenue filter by not acknowledging the fact that entire
revenue of the company comes provision of services, and services income being
100% of its sales, the company qualifies the filter.
6\. The I)RP erred in directing exclusion of M/s. ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd.,
from the list of comparables on the ground that it is into diversified
activity and no segmental data is available, without appreciating that the
basic faction of the company is developing software talons in those and other
verticals. The company's business of analysis of statistical data of its
clients before providing software solutions does no render the services to be
functionally incomparable.
7\. The DRP erred directing to exclude MIs. E-Zest Solutions Ltd. from the
list of comparables holding it to be functionally uncomparable, thereby by
seeking exact comparability by imposing condition beyond law whereas
requirement of law is to acknowledge only those differences that are likely to
materially affect the margin, the DRP thought to have appreciated that the
comparable affect the qualified all the qualitative and quantitative filters
applied by the TPO and in a computer software services, if considered as a
sector of business, the 15 different lines prevailing in the business can not
be considered functionally different from each other.
8\. The DRP erred in directing exclusion of M/s. Infosys Technologies Ltd.,
from the list of companies holding it to be functional incomparable, without
appreciating that the primary source of income of the comparable is from
provision of software development services. Also the DRP erred in imposing a
condition beyond law in seeking exact comparability that are likely to
materially affect the margin,
9\. The DRP erred in directing the position of law that there could be
differences between the enterprises compared under TNMM method that are not
likely to materially affect the price or cost charged or the profits accruing
to such enterprises.
10\. The DRP erred in directing the AO to exclude M/s. Tata Elxsi Ltd. from
the list of comparables, holding it to be functionally uncomparable, without
appreciating the that fact the comparable qualified all the qualitative and
quantitative filter applied by the TPO and it is a similar comparable company
and moreover, the requirement of law and international jurisprudence require
seeking similar comparable company and moreover, the requirement of law and
international jurisprudence require seeking similar comparable companies while
searching for comparable companies under TNMM. The DRY has also not
appreciated that there have been no projects in visual computing labs during
the relevant previous year. Corporate issue:-
11\. The DRP erred in directing the AO to follow the ratio laid down by the
Honble court in the case of Tata Elxsi Limited 349 ITR 98 and exclude travel
and conveyance expenses as well as expenditure on repairs and  Page 4 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 maintenance, from the total
turnover also, while computing the deduction u/s 10 A of the l.T Act, Without
appreciating the fact that there is no provision in section 1 OA that a such
expenses should be reduced from the total turnover also, as clause (iv) of the
explanation to section I OA provides that that Such expenses are to be reduced
only from the export turnover." CO No. 7/B/2017 (by assessee) 1 The directions
dated December 28, 2015 passed by the Honorable Dispute Resolution Panel
("DRP") in so far as it relates to the following ground are opposed to law and
facts of the case. 2 The Honorable DRP and the learned Assessing Officer
("AO") have erred in upholding the action of the Transfer Pricing Officer
("TPO") in rejecting the Transfer Pricing ("TP") documentation maintained and
the detailed benchmarking analysis conducted by the Cross-Objector; 3 The
Honorable DRP and learned TPO have erred in law and on facts in rejecting the
use of multiple year data, without considering that the past year data had an
influence on the determination of arm's length price and that the Cross-
objector had considered contemporaneous data available at the time when it
carried out the benchmarking study having regard to the statutory requirement
to maintain the TP documentation by the specified date;
4 The Honorable DRP and the TPO have erred in law and on facts in undertaking
a new search and arriving at a fresh set of comparables." Brief facts of the
case are as under:
2\. Assessee is a company and has filed return of income for year under
consideration on 30/09/2011 showing total income of Rs.7,65,881/- after
claiming deduction under section 10 A to the extent of Rs.3,36,39,775/-. The
case was selected for scrutiny and notice under section 143(2) was issued to
assessee along with notice under section 142(1). In response to statutory
notices, representative of assessee appeared before Ld.AO and filed details
that were examined. Ld.AO observed that during the year, assessee had
international transaction exceeding Rs.15 crores. Accordingly reference was
made to the transfer pricing officer for determining arms length price of
international transaction as per provisions of section 92CA of the Act.

IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017
3\. On receipt of reference under section 92CA, Ld.TPO called for economic
details of international transaction between assessee and its AE in Form 3
CEB. It is noted by us that, assessee was erstwhile known as M/s.Broadcom
Communications Technologies Pvt.Ltd., which got subsequently merged with LSI
India Research and Development Pvt.Ltd.

5\. Ld.TPO noted that assessee has computed its margin at 13%. It was noted
that assessee used following 9 comparables for software development services
rendered by it and applied TNMM as most appropriate method to compute arms
length of the international transaction by using OP/OC as PLI. Assessee had
computed the margin of comparable at 10.22%, thereby holding the transaction
to be at arms length.

7\. It is submitted that, Ld.TPO provided adjustment restricting it to 1.63%
towards working capital. Ld.TPO also rejected risk adjustment in the hands of
assessee as no details were provided by assessee to eliminate such material
effect or differences. Ld.TPO thus computed proposed adjustment being
shortfall of Rs.4,72,58,655/- in the hands of assessee.

11\. DRP allowed working capital to be computed as per actual following
decision of this Tribunal in case of M/s.Rambus Chip Technologies (I)
Pvt.Ltd., in IT(TP)A No.23/Bang/2015. DRP also directed to rectify the
arithmetical mistake if any in computation of adjustment in respect of
comparables retained.
12\. DRP further allowed sum of Rs.73,75,224/- towards expenditure incurred in
foreign currency on travel and Rs.1,60,25,123/- as expenditure towards repairs
and  Page 8 of 23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 maintenance,
while computing export turnover and total turnover for purposes of deduction
under section 10A of the Act by following decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court in case of Tata Elxsi reported in [2012] 17 taxmann.com 100. DRP also
held that losses suffered by non-eligible units cannot be set off against the
eligible profit by following decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case
of CIT vs Yukogava India Ltd reported in (2012) 21 Taxmann.com 154.
13\. On receipt of DRP directions, Ld.AO passed final assessment order by
making, transfer pricing addition as per proposed adjustment by Ld.TP O.
14\. Aggrieved by order of Ld.AO, revenue is in appeal before us. Assessee
filed cross objection against the appeal filed by revenue. In revenue's
appeal, grounds raised pertain to application of "on- site revenue filter" and
selectively rejecting certain comparables. It has also been alledged that DRP
excluded E-Infochips Ltd., on the ground of having service income less than
75% of sales, which is alleged to be contrary to observations of Ld.TPO. It is
also alleged that certain comparables have been excluded functional
incomparability. Revenue alleged exclusion of following comparables:
• M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd.
• M/s.L&T Infotech Ltd.
• E-Infochips Ltd.
• ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd.
• E zhest Solutions Ltd.
Page 9 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 • Infosys Technologies Ltd.
• M/s.TATA Elxi Ltd.
15\. Other issues alleged by revenue is in respect of corporate tax issue
challenging exclusion of communication expenses for export turnover and total
turnover for purposes of computing deduction under section 10A and accepting
assessee claim of not considering losss from non-eligible unit while computing
deduction u/s.10 of the Act.
16\. In cross appeal filed by assessee it is observed that assessee challenges
exclusion of 3 comparables in Ground No.5 on the basis of functional
dissimilarities, being; • LGS Global Ltd.
• R Systems International Ltd.
• Akshay Software Technologies Ltd.
17\. Assessee challenges exclusion of 2 comparables in Ground No.6 for stating
that it fails employee filter: • Hellios and Matheson Technology Ltd.
• CG-VAK Software & Exports Ltd.
18\. Assessee challenges inclusion of 2 comparables in Ground No.8 for stating
that it fails employee filter: • Persistent Systems and Solutions Ltd;
• Persistent Systems Ltd;
19\. Apart from the above referred comparables, Ld.AR has not pressed upon and
argued any other issues raised in the ground of appeal. Accordingly we are
restricting our observation in  Page 10 of 23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO
No.7/Bang/2017 respect of selected comparables refer to herein above alleged
by assessee for inclusion/exclusion.
20\. Before we undertake comparability analysis, it's sine qua non to
understand the FAR of assessee under software development service segment.
Transfer pricing study report is placed at page 97-229 of paper book.
Functions:
21\. Assessee is submitted to be primarily engaged in the development of VLSI,
software, embedded software and hardware design solutions to support broadband
wireless access. The Company provides embedded software and hardware design
solutions a are incorporated in the chipsets manufactured by its associated
enterprises. These comprise:
> • Physical layer algorithm development and implementation • Media access
> controller (MAC) algorithm development and implementation • Design,
> implementation, and integration of protocol stacks that will enable
> communication according to the standards approved and authorized by the
> international community.
22\. The assessee's product offering is to enable the manufacture of a point-
to-point and point to multi-point broadband communication system.
23\. Assessee has entered into an inter-company agreement for provision of
software development services to its associated enterprises. For the provision
of said services, BCTPL is compensated on a cost plus basis.
Page 11 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 Assets Owned:
24\. It has been submitted that assessee owns routine tangible assets like,
furniture, fixtures, computers etc. It is also submitted that it does not
possess nor does it develop any non- routine valuable intangibles.
Risk Assumed:
25\. Assessee does not bare any contract and service liability risk as it
render services solely to AE. It has been submitted that assessee is
compensated on a cost plus basis and is therefore insulated from the risk of
under utilisation of capacity. It is also submitted that Foreign exchange
fluctuation on risk is also vests with AE.
Characterisation
26\. Based on the above, it can be concluded that assessee is bearing
substantially less than normal risks, as it performs limited functions with
guidance provided by AE. We first take up appeal filed by revenue in ITA
No.482Bang/2016 Ground No. 2 -4:
27\. Ld.CIT.DR submitted that, DRP applied applying "on-site revenue filter"
selectively respect of following comparables: • Acropetal Technologies Ltd •
L&T Infotech Ltd.,
28\. He submitted that, DRP suo-moto applied on-site revenue filter
selectively. It was argued that application of a filter determines, kind of
comparables displayed on database, where  Page 12 of 23 IT(TP)A
No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 search is carried. Application of filter to
shortlist companies under particular segment is the second step in transfer
pricing analysis. It was argued that, once comparables are shortlisted by
Ld.TPO, DRP suo moto cannot apply any filter to exclude any particular
comparables. Ld.CIT.DR submitted that, DRP applied "on-site revenue filter"
and excluded 3 comparables, which is not considered by TPO. He submitted that
"on-site revenue filter" applied by DRP, neither applied by assessee in
transfer pricing study nor considered by Ld.TPO, while conducting analysis
under section 92CA of the Act.
29\. It is contended by Ld.CIT.DR that, entire analysis needs to be revisited
based on new filter applied by DRP and therefore needs to be remanded to
Ld.TPO.
30\. On the contrary, Ld.AR submitted that, issue of suo moto application of
"on-site revenue" filter by DRP has been addressed by coordinate bench of this
Tribunal in case of Electronics for Imaging India Pvt. Ltd., vs. DCIT for
assessment year 2011-12 reported in [2017] 85 taxmann.com 124. He further
submitted that assessee do not have any objection of RS software India Pvt.
Ltd., to be included.
31\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of
records placed before us.
32\. Main grievance of revenue is in respect of on-site revenue filter applied
by DRP suo moto selectively, on certain comparables, and excluding them. On
this, we agree with contention raised by Ld.CIT.DR that a filter cannot be
applied  Page 13 of 23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 once TP
analysis has been concluded by Ld.TPO However, on perusal of observations
recorded by DRP, Acropetal Technologies Ltd., L&T Infotech Ltd., was primarily
excluded on basis of functional dissimilarities and that segmental information
not being available. DRP further observed that these comparables cannot be
considered as comparable with low risk bearing contract service provider like
assessee. Further, Ld.AR relied on decision of coordinate bench of this
Tribunal in case of Electronics for Imaging India Pvt. Ltd., vs. DCIT for
assessment year 2011-12 reported in [2017] 85 taxmann.com 124, wherein these
comparables have been held to be functionally different with a contract
service provider like assessee.
33\. At this juncture, we note that application of 'suo moto' on site revenue
filter has been considered by this Tribunal for same assessment year in
following cases, where DRP excluded same comparables. We also not that, DRP
therein excluded same set of comparables, based on identical observations: •
DCIT vs. CGI Information Systems & Management Consultation (P.) Ltd reported
in [2018] 93 taxmann.com 9 • DCIT Vs Herbalife International India (P.) Ltd
reported in [2019] 111 taxmann.com 244 • HP decision
34\. We note that under similar circumstances this Tribunal in case of DCIT vs
CGI Information Systems (supra) observed as under:
Page 14 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 "19. Acropetal Technologies Limited
- As far as exclusion of this company as a comparable company is concerned, it
is seen from the Directions of the DRP at paragraph 2.7 at page-9, that this
company was excluded on the grounds that: (i) the segmental information
containing the break-up of its export sales and employee costs, was not
available and it was not possible to ascertain if it passed the export
earnings and/or employee costs filters; and (ii) a substantial portion of its
software development activities have been outsourced on sub- contract and it
could, therefore, not be retained as a comparable. The DRP in directing
exclusion of this company followed decision of Hyderbad Bench of ITAT in the
case of Capital IQ Information Systems (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT
(International Taxation) [2013] 32 taxmann.com 21/57 SOT 14 (URO) (Hyd. -
Trib.). The DRP also observed that this company was predominantly doing on-
site development of software and therefore cannot be compared with a company
which develops software off-shore. One of the filters applied by the TPO was
that companies where employee costs are less than 25% of turnover cannot be
regarded as comparable. In the absence of segmental information, it was not
possible to ascertain as to whether this company passes the test adopted by
the TPO himself for comparison. The learned DR submitted that the required
data can be culled out from the information available in the public domain or
by resorting to a process of calling for information from this company
u/s.133(6) of the Act. The learned counsel for the Assessee in this regard
pointed out that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court rejected a similar argument by
the Revenue in the case of Pr. CIT v. Saxo India (P.) Ltd. [2016] 74
taxmann.com 88/243 Taxman 411/397 ITR 160. In the circumstances, this company
was rightly held by the DRP to be not comparable. We are of the view that once
a company becomes not comparable for the reason that segmental information to
apply filters, we need not consider any other aspect of comparability. The
learned counsel for the Assessee made submissions before us that this company
was rightly directed to be excluded by the DRP on the above basis and further
contended that even otherwise, this company is not functionally comparable to
the Assessee. As already stated, we do not wish to go into this aspect as this
company goes out of comparability on other reasons.
20\. L & T Infotech Ltd.- This company was directed to be excluded by the DRP
for the following reasons: (i) 48.84% of its total expenses are incurred in
foreign currency, which includes substantial expenses on sub-contracting,
indicating that the company has high onsite revenue;
(ii) the TPO has considered the entire revenue from its 3 segments, viz.
financial services, manufacturing and telecom as was disclosed in its Annual
Report for FY 2010-11, for the purposes of comparability to the  Page 15 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 Assessee's software development
services; and (iii) predominantly engaged in the onsite development of
software in FY 2010-11. The learned DR submitted before us that the Assessee's
profile also is similar to the profile of L & T Infotech Ltd. and therefore
this company should be included as comparable company. He also submitted that
what is the quantum of on-site revenue has not been spelt out by the DRP. In
this regard it was argued by him that on-site revenue beyond 25% of the total
revenue of the company would be beyond the tolerance level and without a
finding that on-site revenue is more than 25% of the total revenue, this
company ought not to have been excluded from the list of comparable companies.
We agree with the submission of the learned DR that for application of on-site
revenue filter, the DRP ought to have given a finding regarding the quantum of
revenue from on-site software development. Nevertheless, this company goes out
of comparability on the ground that the profit margins adopted by the TPO was
from 3 divisions of the Assessee. We also find, as submitted by the learned
counsel for the Assessee this company was held to be functionally not
comparable as it is a market leader and thus enjoys significant benefits on
account of ownership of marketing intangibles and intellectual property
rights. Also, in addition to the above, the company owns proprietary software
products which are developed in- house. Accordingly, the Assessee submits that
the company is a product company having significant intangibles and is thus
not comparable to captive software service providers such as the Assessee. In
this regard the learned counsel for the Assessee has placed reliance on the
decisions of this Hon'ble Tribunal in Applied Materials (India) (P.) Ltd. v.
ACIT [Appeal No. 17 (Bang.) of 2016] at para 19 on pages 35-36] and Commscope
Networks (I) (P.) Ltd. v. ITO [IT (TP) Appeal No. 166 (Bang.) of 2016] at para
9 on pages 16-17] where the exclusion of the said company from the list of
comparables in similar circumstances was upheld by this Hon'ble Tribunal. We
therefore do not find any grounds to interfere with the directions of the DRP
on exclusion of this company."
35\. Further, Ld.AR alleged that, Acropetal and L&T Infotech are functionally
not similar with a contract service provider like assessee. This observation
could not be dislodged by Ld.CIT.DR. We also note that, Acropetal Technologies
has been held to be into products and that L&T Infotech Ltd has observed that
RPT is at 18.66% which is beyond the marginal limit of 15% for year under
consideration, by this Tribunal, in case of Electronics for  Page 16 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 Imaging India Pvt.Ltd (supra). We
therefore do not find any infirmity in the view taken by DRP as these
comparables are even otherwise functionally not similar with assessee.
Respectfully following the aforesaid decisions, we direct exclusion of
Acropetal Technologies and L&T Infotech Ltd.
36\. Ground No.5 is against excluding M/s.E-Infochips, by DRP on the ground
that it fails service income filter.
37\. Ld.CIT DR submitted that Ld.TPO while analysing comparables observed
that, this company has revenue from software development up to 88%. Submitted
that per contra, DRP observes that revenue earned by this company is less than
75%, and therefore cannot be included. She submitted that basis of DRP to hold
that revenue is less than 75% has not been demonstrated and therefore needs to
be reconsidered.
38\. Ld.AR placed reliance upon decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal
in case of Electronics for Imaging India Pvt.Ltd (supra) wherein, E- Infochips
Ltd is excluded for failing in service income filter. We have perused
submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed before us.
39\. It is observed that this Tribunal in case of Autodesk India Pvt Ltd. vs
ACIT (supra) excluded E- Infochips Ltd., by following view taken by this
Tribunal in case of Comscop Network (India) Pvt.Ltd. Limited vs ITO in IT (TP)
A/Bang/2016 dated 22/02/17 wherein, this company was excluded for reason that,
there is no segmental information regarding diverse functions performed by
this company and that there was major fluctuation in its profits,  Page 17 of
23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 which influenced turnover of
this company. We also note that this Tribunal in case of DCIT vs CGI
Information Systems (supra) had encountered with an identical situation for
year under consideration. This tribunal observed as under:
> "24. As far as ground No. 4 raised by revenue is concerned, the said ground
> of appeal is weak and any event comparability of companies that were
> excluded by the DRP were on valid grounds contemplated by the relevant
> statutory provisions of the act and rules. As far as ground No. 5 in
> revenue's appeal is concerned, the revenue seeks to challenge the exclusion
> of AE Infotech Ltd. On the ground that it failed direct software service
> income filter at 75%. At the outset, the assessee submits that E Infotech
> Ltd was excluded by the DRP on the ground that: (i) no segmental information
> is regarding its diverse functions is available; (ii) it failed the software
> service income filter and 75%; (iii) there were major fluctuations in profit
> and turnover every years which seems to be influenced by
> extraordinary/peculiar circumstances; and (iv) there is a presence of
> inventory (page 10 and 11 of the DRP's directions). The revenue, in its
> appeal has challenged its exclusion only on the 2nd ground. In other words,
> the revenue has not challenged its exclusion on the other grounds stated
> hereinabove and thus its exclusion on these grounds have attained finality
> and cannot be disturbed by this Hon'ble Tribunal. Even otherwise, we are of
> the view that the DRP rightly arrived at the finding that companies software
> development service revenue for FY 2010-11 was less than 75% of its total
> operating revenue for the year. Thus the above action of the DRP in
> rejecting the above companies correct."
40\. From the above, it is observed by this Tribunal consistently in various
decisions for A.Y: 2011-12 held that, this company does not satisfy service
income filter being 75%. We therefore, do not see any reason to set aside this
company to Ld.TPO. Therefore, respectfully following view taken by coordinate
bench of this Tribunal in DCIT vs M/s CGI Information Systems and Management
Consultations Pvt.Ltd. (supra), we direct Ld. TPO to exclude this company.
Accordingly this ground raised by revenue stands dismissed.
Page 18 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 Ground 6-10:
41\. ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd., E-Zhest Solutions Ltd., M/s.Infosys
Technologies Ltd. and M/s.Tata Elxsi Ltd. It has been submitted by Ld.CIT.DR
that, DRP erred in directing exclusion of ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd on the
ground that it is into diversified activity and no segmental details are
available. In respect of E-Zhest Solutions Ltd., M/s.Infisys Technologies Ltd.
and M/s.Tata Elxsi Ltd., Ld.CIT DR submitted that DRP excluded them for
functionally not comparable. He submitted supporting order of Ld.TPO that they
are predominantly into Software development.
42\. Ld.CIT.DR thus submitted that, these comparables are into SWD and is
functionally similar with assessee and deserves to be included.
43\. On the contrary, Ld.AR relied on decisions of coordinate bench of this
Tribunal in case of Applied Material India Pvt.Ltd reported in
TS-815-ITAT-2015, and GT Nexus Software Pvt.Ltd., Vs. DICT in IT(TP)A
Nos.31&409/Bang/2016 dated 18/4/2017 for same assessment years, which is
followed in plethora of other decisions of this Tribunal for exclusion of
these comparables. He submitted that all these comparables have been excluded
from DCIT vs. LSI India Research Pvt.Ltd reported in (2017) 83 taxmann.com 357
for assessment year 2011-12, being the Transferee Company as under:
"9. Now we decide about the remaining six comparables excluded by the DRP and
other four comparables retained by the DRP for which the assessee is seeking
exclusion. We find that out of these six comparables excluded by the  Page 19
of 23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 DRP, one comparable i.e. ICRA
Techno Analytics Ltd. is having RPT in excess of 15% and therefore, for this
reason alone this company has to be excluded although, the DRP has excluded it
for a different reason that it is having various activities and the segmental
data are not available. We hold this exclusion on account of RPT filter. In
fact, we find that para-8 & 9 of the Tribunal order rendered in the case
Commscope Networks (India) (P.) Ltd. (Supra) is relevant in respect of
inclusion/exclusion of nine companies directed to be excluded by DRP and also
in respect of exclusion of four companies which were retained by DRP but it
was the contention of the assessee for exclusion thereof. We therefore, re-
produce para-8 & 9 of the Tribunal order for the sake of ready reference;
"8. We decide the issue of various exclusions and inclusions in these cross
appeals. Regarding inclusion of 3 comparables out of 9 comparables excluded by
DRP, we find that when both sides are seeking inclusion of these 3 comparables
being 1 (Evoke Technologies Pvt Ltd., 2) Mindtree Ltd. (Seg) and 3) R S
Software (India) Ltd. and their inclusion is proper as per the tribunal order
rendered in the case of Applied Materials India Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT as reported
in TS-815- ITAT - 2016, we reverse the order; of DRP; about exclusion of these
3 '' comparables and 'direct the AO/TPO to include these three in final list
of comparables.
9\. Now we decide about the remaining 6 comparables excluded by DRP and 4
comparables retained by DRP but for which the assessee is seeking exclusion.
Out of these 6 comparables excluded by DRP, one comparable ICRA Techno
Analytics Ltd. is having RPT in excess of 15% and therefore, for this reason
alone, this comparable has to be excluded although DRP has excluded it for a
different reason that it is having various activities and segmental data are
not available. We uphold its exclusion on account of RPT filter. Exclusion of
Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg) is covered in favour of the assessee by the
same tribunal order rendered in the case of Applied materials India Pvt. Ltd.
v. ACIT (Supra). Respectfully following the same, we uphold its exclusion.
Exclusion of 1) e - Zest Solutions Ltd., 2) Infosys Ltd., 3) Larsen & Toubro
Infotech Ltd., 4) Persistent Systems & Solutions Ltd.,
5) Persistent Systems Ltd., 6) Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. and 7)
Tata Ebcsi Ltd. are also covered in favour of the assessee by the same
tribunal order rendered in the case of Applied Materials India Pvt. Ltd. v.
ACIT (Supra). Respectfully following the same, we uphold the exclusion of
these Seven comparables also. Exclusion of E - Infochips Ltd. is covered in
favour of the assessee by the tribunal order rendered in the case of Saxo
India Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT in ITA No, 6148/Del/2015 dated 05.02.2016 Para 10.1 &
10.2 available at pages 221 to 223. Respectfully following the same, we uphold
its  Page 20 of 23 IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017 exclusion. In
this manner, we uphold the exclusion of six comparables excluded by DRP out of
9 comparables excluded by DRP and exclude 4 comparables retained by DRP and we
have already held that out of 9 comparables excluded by DRP, 3 have to come
back being 1.) Evoke Technologies Pvt, Ltd., 2) Mindtree Ltd. (Seg) and 3) R S
Software (India) Ltd. Now, we decide about LGS Global Ltd. As per the tribunal
order rendered in the case of Applied materials India Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT
(Supra), this is a good comparable and therefore, we direct the A.O. and TPO
to include this comparable. So, there should be 4 comparables in the final
list of comparable and on the basis of that, the AO/TPO should work out the
ALP".
10\. As per the above two paras, reproduced from the order of the Tribunal
rendered in the case Commscope Networks (India) (P.) Ltd. (Supra), we find
that in that case, the Tribunal held that out of 9 comparables excluded by
DRP, 3 have to come back being 1) Evoke Technologies Pvt. Ltd., 2) Mindtree
Ltd. (Seg) and 3) R S Software (India) Ltd. Out of remaining 10 comparable
companies selected by TPO, the tribunal in that case excluded. 9 companies
being 1) ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd., 2) Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg), 3)
e
\- Zest Solutions Ltd., 4) Infosys Ltd., 5) Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd., 6)
Persistent Systems & Solutions Ltd., 7) Persistent Systems Ltd., 8) Sasken
Communication Technologies Ltd, and 9) Tata Elxsi Ltd. Hence, in that case,
only four companies were left in the final list of comparables being J) 1)
Evoke Technologies Pvt. Ltd., 2) Mindtree Ltd. (Seg) and 3) R S Software
(India) Ltd. and 4) Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd.
44\. From the above, it is observed that ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd., E-Zhest
Solutions Ltd., M/s.Infosys Technologies Ltd. and M/s.Tata Elxsi Ltd., have
been consistently excluded by this Tribunal in case of a captive service
provider like assessee. Further Ld.CIT DR could not establish anything
contrary to observations of this Tribunal reproduced hereinabove.
45\. Respectfully following aforestated view, we do not find any infirmity in
exclusion of these comparables by DRP. Accordingly these Grounds raised by
revenue stands dismissed.
Page 21 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017
46\. Ground No.11 has been challenged by revenue for excluding communication
expenses for computing total turnover and export turnover and excluding loss
earned from non-eligible unit for purposes of 10 A deduction.
47\. We note that DRP by following decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court,
in the case of CIT v. Tata Elxsi Ltd. reported in [2012] 17 taxmann.com 100
held that, if any expenditure is excluded from export turnover, then the same
needs to be excluded from total turnover as well, accordingly, directing Ld.AO
to exclude expenses deducted from export turnover from total turnover for
computing deduction u/s 10A of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
48\. Further in respect of exclusion of loss earned from non- eligible unit
for computing profits of eligible unit under section 10 A, DRP relied on
decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case of and CIT v. Yokogava India
Ltd. reported in [2012] 21 taxmann.com 154
49\. We do not find any infirmity in the view taken by DRP as it is supported
by ratios held by Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court. There is nothing on
record brought by revenue to establish any distinguishing factors to deviate
from the ratio of Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court.
Accordingly these grounds raised by revenue stands dismissed.
In the result appeal filed by revenue stands dismissed.
Page 22 of 23
IT(TP)A No.482/Bang/2016 CO No.7/Bang/2017
50\. Since revenue's appeal is dismissed, cross objection filed by assessee
becomes infructuous.
In the result, cross objection filed by assessee also stands dismissed.
