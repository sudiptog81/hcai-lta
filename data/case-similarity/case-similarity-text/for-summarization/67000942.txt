Flexpack Ltd., (cited supra) has held the same view. Therefore, the impugned
demand holding that the appellant has not received any input service and
therefore nor eligible for any service tax credit is unsustainable in law.
Secondly, we notice that the entire demand is time barred. As early as in

liability. The receipt of service and availment to service tax credit was also
reflected by the appellant in the monthly ER-1 returns. Therefore, the whole

    Per: P.R.Chandrasekharan
    1.	The appeal is directed against Order-in-Original No.59/Commr/M-III/PKA/2011-12 dated 30/01/2012 passed by Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-III.
    2.	The appellant, M/s.S.H.Kelkar & Co. Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, are manufactures of fragrances and aroma chemicals falling under Chapters 29 & 33 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985.  It appears that the appellant availed service tax credit on Intellectual Property Right (IPR) services during September 2007 to July 2008 on such services provided by    Shri G.D.Kelkar, the Managing Director of the appellants firm to the appellant.  Revenue was of the view that services rendered by Shri G.D. Kelkar, who is an employee to the appellant firm, cannot be considered as a service rendered and therefore, no credit can be taken of the service tax paid on such IPR services.  A statement of Shri.R. Rajangam, Chief Financial Officer of the company recorded under Section 14 of the Central Excise Act, also revealed that Shri G.D.Kelkar, as a Managing Director,  was an employee of the company and was using the laboratory facilities  of the company and the raw materials provided by the company to create a new products. Therefore, IPR, if any, belongs to the company and not to the individual and therefore, no IPR services have provided by Shri Kelkar to the appellant firm.  Accordingly, a show-cause notice dated 03/01/2011  was issued proposing to deny the service tax paid on IPR services amounting to Rs.1,23,90,991/ under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section11A of Central Excise Act, 1944.  Since the appellant had utilised the Cenvat Credit and cleared excisable goods, it was proposed to hold that the goods cleared  by utilizing wrongly availed credit is  liable to confiscation under the provisions of Rule 25 of the Central Excise Rules, 2002.  The show-cause notice also proposed to impose penalty on the appellant under the provisions of Rule 15 (3) of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004.  The notice was adjudicated and the impugned order was passed wherein  Cenvat Credit amounting to Rs.1,23,90,991/- was denied and was sought to be recovered under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 along with interest thereon under Rule 14 read with Section 11A ibid. A penalty of Rs.2,000/- was also imposed on the appellant.  Goods which were cleared by utilizing  wrongly availed Cenvat credit was confiscated in terms of Rule 25 of the Central Excise Rules, 2002 and since the goods were not available for confiscation, a redemption fine of Rs.20 lakhs was imposed under the provisions of Section 34 of the Central Excise Act, 1944.  Aggrieved of the same, the appellant is before us. 
    3.	The Ld. Counsel for the appellant made the following submissions.
3.1 In April 2007 the Central Excise authorities conducted audit of the
appellants records and enquired about the royalty payments made to Shri
G.D.Kelkar. The appellant explained that the royalty was paid to Shri
G.D.Kelkar as per the decision of the Board of Directors of the company,
inasmuch as Shri G.D.Kelkar had developed certain formulas and processes
useful for the manufacture of the products by the appellant company. The
department informed the appellant that the royalty payment attracted liability
to service tax. Vide letter dated 26/06/2007 the jurisdictional Superintendent
(Audit) of the Mumbai-III Commissionerate, issued a letter to the appellant
directing them to pay service tax amounting to Rs.59,57,159/- plus interest
being the service tax payable on an amount of Rs.4,86,69,596/- paid to Shri
G.D.Kelkar by way of royalty. In pursuance to the said direction, Shri
G.D.Kelkar got himself registered with the department under the category of
IPR services. Vide application dated 24/04/2007, Shri G.D. Kelkar was
registered with the Service Tax Department under IPR services vide
Registration No.AACPK8376KST001. Thereafter, Shri G.D.Kelkar paid a sum of
Rs.52,03,449/- towards service tax on a royalty amount of Rs.4,33,62,075/-
along with education cess of Rs.1,04,069/- and interest and penalty amounting
to Rs.12,46,592/- vide a challan dated 28/06/2007. Shri Kelkar also paid
another sum of Rs.7,08,745/- towards the differential service tax payable as
the royalty received by him Rs.4,86,69,596/- vide challan dated 20/07/2007.
This was for the period 2005-06. Subsequently Shri Kelkar paid a service tax
amount of Rs.63,75,428/- for a royalty amount of Rs.5,15,81,137/- for the
period 2006-07. Shri Kelkar also filed service tax returns reflecting the
above payments vide returns dated 24/10/2007 for the period April 2006 to
September 2006 and April 2007 to September 2007. He also raised invoices on
the appellant vide invoices dated 05/07/2007 and 05/03/2008 for the royalty
payments towards IPR services rendered by him. On the strength of these
invoices, the appellant took credit of the service tax paid on the IPR
services received by them from Shri Kelkar. Therefore, the entire transactions
were undertaken in accordance with the law with the full knowledge of the
department. The payment of service tax by Kelkar has not been disputed by the
department and has been accepted by the department. If that be so, the
department cannot take the stand that the appellant did not receive any
services and the credit taken by on the services paid on IPR services is not
an eligible credit. The Ld. Counsel contends that the taxability and the
related issues of input service has to be decided by the departmental
authorities having jurisdiction over the service provider and the authorities
of the recipient factory cannot sit on judgement of these matters and relies
on the decision of this Tribunal in the case of Ultratech Cement Vs CCE,Nagpur
 2011 (22) STR 289, Prem Cables Pvt. Ltd., Vs. CCE, Nagpur  2001 (127) ELT
400 (Tri  Del), CCE Vs. Purity Flexpack Ltd. (Gujarat High Court)  2008 (9)
STR 125. It is also contended that the department was aware of the whole
transaction and therefore, there is no suppression on the part of the
appellant in taking the credit and availing the same and therefore, demands
are barred by limitation as held in the following decisions:
a) Fedders Lloyd Corporation Vs. CCE, New Delhi  2002 (149) ELT 1426 (Tri-
Del) as affirmed by Supreme Court in 182 (ELT A-38
b) Maruti Udyog Ltd., Vs. CCE, Delhi  2002 (147) ELT 881 (Tri-Del).
c) Gopal Zarda Udyog Vs. CCE, New Delhi (Supreme Court)  2005 (188) ELT 251
4\. The Ld. Commissioner (AR) appearing for the Revenue reiterates the
findings of the adjudicating authority.
5\. We have carefully considered the rival submissions.
5.1 From the facts narrated above, it is clear that it was at the behest of
the department, Shri Kelkar discharged the service tax liability on IPR
services on the royalty received by him from the appellant company. Shri
Kelkar also took registration and discharged the duty liability and also filed
returns assessing the liability to service tax. The payments made by Shri
Kelkar was accepted by the department and no dispute was raised on the
assessment returns filed by Shri Kelkar.
5.2 In other words, the discharge of service tax liability by the service
provider was never disputed by the department at all. Shri Kelkar also raised
invoices on the appellant, which shows the nature of the services rendered,
the amount charged, the service tax liability discharged and all other
relevant particulars. On the strength of these invoices, the appellant company
has taken credit. Once the appellant has received the services and has borne
the incidence of service tax, the appellant is rightly entitled to the service
tax credit. The authorities at the service recipients end has no jurisdiction
to question the classification of service and the liability to service tax so
long as the authorities having jurisdiction over the service providers end do
not dispute the same. In a series of decisions, this Tribunal has held that
departmental authorities having jurisdiction over the service
recipient/manufacturer of final products cannot sit on judgements or decision
over the excise duty/service tax paid by the input service provider or the
input manufacturer. The Honble High Court of Gujarat also in the Purity
Flexpack Ltd., (cited supra) has held the same view. Therefore, the impugned
demand holding that the appellant has not received any input service and
therefore nor eligible for any service tax credit is unsustainable in law.
Secondly, we notice that the entire demand is time barred. As early as in
2007, when the records of the appellant firm were audited by the department
the payment of royalty to Shri Kelkar and receipt of service by the appellant
was known to the department, and thereafter, on the advice of the department
Shri Kelkar obtained service tax registration and discharged service tax
liability. The receipt of service and availment to service tax credit was also
reflected by the appellant in the monthly ER-1 returns. Therefore, the whole
transaction, the payment of service tax and availment of credit thereon was in
the full knowledge of the department. In spite of having the information, the
show-cause notice has been issued in this case only in January 2011 after a
lapse of more than 3 = years. Thus, the demand is clearly time barred.
6\. In view of the above, we are of the view that the impugned order is not
sustainable in law and accordingly, the same is set aside and the appeal is
allowed.

    Per: P.R.Chandrasekharan
    1.	The appeal is directed against Order-in-Original No.59/Commr/M-III/PKA/2011-12 dated 30/01/2012 passed by Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-III.
    2.	The appellant, M/s.S.H.Kelkar & Co. Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, are manufactures of fragrances and aroma chemicals falling under Chapters 29 & 33 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985.  It appears that the appellant availed service tax credit on Intellectual Property Right (IPR) services during September 2007 to July 2008 on such services provided by    Shri G.D.Kelkar, the Managing Director of the appellants firm to the appellant.  Revenue was of the view that services rendered by Shri G.D. Kelkar, who is an employee to the appellant firm, cannot be considered as a service rendered and therefore, no credit can be taken of the service tax paid on such IPR services.  A statement of Shri.R. Rajangam, Chief Financial Officer of the company recorded under Section 14 of the Central Excise Act, also revealed that Shri G.D.Kelkar, as a Managing Director,  was an employee of the company and was using the laboratory facilities  of the company and the raw materials provided by the company to create a new products. Therefore, IPR, if any, belongs to the company and not to the individual and therefore, no IPR services have provided by Shri Kelkar to the appellant firm.  Accordingly, a show-cause notice dated 03/01/2011  was issued proposing to deny the service tax paid on IPR services amounting to Rs.1,23,90,991/ under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section11A of Central Excise Act, 1944.  Since the appellant had utilised the Cenvat Credit and cleared excisable goods, it was proposed to hold that the goods cleared  by utilizing wrongly availed credit is  liable to confiscation under the provisions of Rule 25 of the Central Excise Rules, 2002.  The show-cause notice also proposed to impose penalty on the appellant under the provisions of Rule 15 (3) of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004.  The notice was adjudicated and the impugned order was passed wherein  Cenvat Credit amounting to Rs.1,23,90,991/- was denied and was sought to be recovered under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 along with interest thereon under Rule 14 read with Section 11A ibid. A penalty of Rs.2,000/- was also imposed on the appellant.  Goods which were cleared by utilizing  wrongly availed Cenvat credit was confiscated in terms of Rule 25 of the Central Excise Rules, 2002 and since the goods were not available for confiscation, a redemption fine of Rs.20 lakhs was imposed under the provisions of Section 34 of the Central Excise Act, 1944.  Aggrieved of the same, the appellant is before us. 
    3.	The Ld. Counsel for the appellant made the following submissions.
3.1 In April 2007 the Central Excise authorities conducted audit of the
appellants records and enquired about the royalty payments made to Shri
G.D.Kelkar. The appellant explained that the royalty was paid to Shri
G.D.Kelkar as per the decision of the Board of Directors of the company,
inasmuch as Shri G.D.Kelkar had developed certain formulas and processes
useful for the manufacture of the products by the appellant company. The
department informed the appellant that the royalty payment attracted liability
to service tax. Vide letter dated 26/06/2007 the jurisdictional Superintendent
(Audit) of the Mumbai-III Commissionerate, issued a letter to the appellant
directing them to pay service tax amounting to Rs.59,57,159/- plus interest
being the service tax payable on an amount of Rs.4,86,69,596/- paid to Shri
G.D.Kelkar by way of royalty. In pursuance to the said direction, Shri
G.D.Kelkar got himself registered with the department under the category of
input manufacturer. The Honble High Court of Gujarat also in the Purity
Flexpack Ltd., (cited supra) has held the same view. Therefore, the impugned
demand holding that the appellant has not received any input service and
therefore nor eligible for any service tax credit is unsustainable in law.
Secondly, we notice that the entire demand is time barred. As early as in
2007, when the records of the appellant firm were audited by the department
the payment of royalty to Shri Kelkar and receipt of service by the appellant
was known to the department, and thereafter, on the advice of the department
Shri Kelkar obtained service tax registration and discharged service tax
liability. The receipt of service and availment to service tax credit was also
reflected by the appellant in the monthly ER-1 returns. Therefore, the whole
transaction, the payment of service tax and availment of credit thereon was in
the full knowledge of the department. In spite of having the information, the
show-cause notice has been issued in this case only in January 2011 after a
lapse of more than 3 = years. Thus, the demand is clearly time barred.
6\. In view of the above, we are of the view that the impugned order is not
