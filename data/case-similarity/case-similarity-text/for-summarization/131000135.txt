31\. The present first appeal of the appellant-defendants is accordingly
REPORTABLE
1\. The defendants - Ram Singh s/o Ghasi Ram & ors have filed the present
first appeal under Section 96 CPC against Bhikam Chand s/o Ram Jeevan & anr.
being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 12/8/2009 passed learned
Addl. District Judge (Fast Track) No.3, Jodhpur in a suit for specific
performance being Civil Suit No. 603/2004 (351/2004) - Bhikam Chand & Arun
Kumar vs. Ram Singh s/o Ghasi Ram & Ors.
2\. The said suit for specific performance was filed by the plaintiffs
\- Bhikam Chand & Ors. on 2/11/2004 in respect of agriculture land belonging
to Ghasi Ram, father of the present appellant-defendant Ram Singh, ad-
measuring 28 bighas 19 biswas situated of Khasra no.821, 822, 823, 824, 827 &
827/1 in village Baga, Tehsil & District SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram
Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  2/35 Jodhpur, which was agreed to be sold to the
plaintiffs under the agreement to sell dated 28/10/1989 at the rate of
Rs.51,000/- per bigha and this agreement dated 28/10/1989 was reiterated under
the fresh agreement executed by the present defendant-appellant-Ram Singh s/o
Ghasi Ram, after the death of his father Ghasi Ram on 25/1/1991, vide new
agreement dated 8/4/1992. Under the agreement dated 28/10/1989, the defendant
Ghasi Ram received a sum of Rs.2 lacs towards the consideration and under the
new agreement dated 8/4/1992, the defendant Ram Singh received a sum of Rs.1
lac and a further sum of Rs.75,000/- on 28/9/1993 and thus a total sum of
Rs.3,75,000/- was paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants under these two
agreements. Since, some litigation was pending with respect of the said
agriculture land, it was agreed between the parties that upon the title of the
defendants being cleared, the plaintiffs would pay the remaining consideration
and the registered sale deed would be executed in their favour and it was also
agreed that the cost of litigation in respect of the said agriculture land
would be borne by the plaintiffs.
3\. It is case of the plaintiffs that after the dispute with regard to the
title of the defendants became clear on mutation in relevant record in their
favour on 18/12/2002 against which the State appeal was dismissed by the
Divisional Commissioner, Jodhpur only on 20/11/2003, the plaintiffs served
registered notice on the defendants on 16/8/2004 for executing the registered
sale deed in their favour as they are ready and willing to pay the balance
amount of SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand &
Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  3/35 consideration for transfer of said agriculture
land and upon refusal on the part of the defendants, the present suit was
filed by the plaintiffs on 2/11/2004.
4\. The defendants contested the said suit and after recording the evidence of
both the parties, the learned trial court decreed the suit by a detailed 70
pages judgment & decree dated 12/8/2009 and directed the defendants to execute
the sale deed subject to some conditions. The operative portion of the
judgment & decree of learned trial court is quoted below for ready reference:-

Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  5/35 appeal was heard and is being disposed of by this
judgment.
6\. The said SLP was filed by the defendants against the interim order passed
by this Court on 15/4/2011 rejecting the stay application filed by the
appellant-defendants in the present case by the detailed order, which is
quoted below for ready reference:-
> "Heard learned counsel for the parties. This first appeal filed against the
> decree dated 12.08.2009 is pending for admission for more than one year.
> Therefore, since Mr.J.R.Patel filed caveat on behalf of the respondents-

> therefore, they cannot be said to have shown readiness and willingness to
> perform their part of contract and, therefore, the SBC First Appeal
> No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  6/35 decree of specific performance could not have
been passed in their favour, which is a discretionary relief as per Section 20
of the Specific Relief Act. He also submitted that the suit itself was barred
by limitation and, therefore, the decree has been passed wrongly in their
favour.
On the other hand, Mr. JR Patel, learned counsel appearing for the
respondents-plaintiffs submitted that the learned trial court, in the impugned
judgment and decree dated 12.08.2009, has directed the balance amount of
Rs.11,01,450/- of the consideration to be deposited within one month, as
Rs.3,75,000/- had already been paid to the defendants. Out of the said amount
of Rs.3,75,000/-, a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- was paid to the original defendant-
seller Ghasi Ram, father of the present appellants-defendants on 28.10.1989 at
the time of execution of the agreement and remaining Rs.1,00,000/- was paid on
08.04.1992 and Rs.75,000/- on 28.09.1993 for confirmation of the said
agreement by the present defendants, the legal representatives of said Ghasi
Ram. He submitted that the learned trial court, even though no such amount of
litigation was ever specified by the defendants-appellants, has directed
Rs.1,00,000/- to be paid on this account and further a sum of Rs.5,98,550/-
towards the increase in the prices of the land and thus a total sum of
Rs.18,00,000/- directed to be deposited within one month has already been
deposited by the respondents-plaintiffs with the learned trial court.
He submitted that the respondents-plaintiffs are also ready to execute the
sale-deed for the plot of land of 50'x50' free of cost as per clause (9) of
the agreement dated 28.10.1989 as directed in para No.4 of the operative part
of the judgment.
SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  7/35 He has further submitted that the respondents-
defendants are trying to wriggle out of the agreement only on account of
escalation of prices of the land in question, which he submitted is no ground
to deny the decree of specific performance to the respondents-plaintiffs. He
also submitted that the respondents-plaintiffs have always been ready and
willing to perform their part of contract and not only the plaintiffs
reimbursed some cost of litigation but since no amount was ever specified by
the defendants in terms of Clause (5) of the agreement, he has willingly
deposited a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- as directed by the learned trial court.
He further urged that in the reply filed to the stay application under Order
41 Rule 5 CPC, the respondents-plaintiffs have further undertaken in para No.
4 that the respondents-plaintiffs would deposit a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- every
year till the present first appeal filed by the appellants- defendants is
decided by this Court and in case the appellants-defendants succeed in this
appeal, the respondents-plaintiffs would not claim refund of the said amount
and this undertaking is given to show the bonafides of the respondents-
plaintiffs in addition to readiness and willingness established by them before
the learned trial court and, therefore, the decree passed by the learned trial
court in their favour is not required to be stayed by this Court.
On the aforesaid conditions, he also submitted that the amount of
Rs.18,00,000/- deposited by the respondents-plaintiffs in the trial court may
also be disbursed to the appellants-defendants subject to the usual
undertaking. He also submitted that the execution of the sale-deed in their
favour and handing SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam
Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  8/35 over the possession of the land in question in
pursuance of the decree under appeal would obviously remain subject to final
decision of this first appeal. However, on equitable consideration, the
execution of the sale deed in favour of plaintiffs deserves to be made on the
conditions imposed by the learned trial court and further undertaking given by
plaintiffs to deposit Rs.10,00,000/- per year during the pendency of this
first appeal.
I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions made at the
Bar of stay application under Order 41 Rule 5 CPC.
It is true that a decree of specific performance is a discretionary relief but
nonetheless mere escalation of prices of land, which happens during the length
of litigation is a natural phenomenon and that cannot be a ground to deny the
relief to the respondents-plaintiffs of specific performance. This Court in
Lahiri Vs. Prem Prakash [AIR 2007 Raj.85], following the Supreme Court
decision in P.C.Verghese's case [(2005) 8 SCC 486] and Continental
Construction Co.Vs.State of M.P. [(1988) 8 SCC 82] on this aspect, has already
held to this effect. In the present case, the respondents-plaintiffs appear to
have not only paid the advance against the consideration agreed by them right
at the time of execution of the agreement but the learned trial court has even
given clear finding in their favour that they were ready and willing to
perform their part of contract. The fact that the respondents-plaintiffs have
immediately deposited a sum of Rs.18,00,000/- as directed by the learned trial
court, which includes not only a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- towards litigation
expenditure but also a sum of Rs. 5,98,550/- against SBC First Appeal
No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  9/35 the escalation of land prices. It appears that
the respondents-plaintiffs have not only been ready and willing to perform
their part of the contract but have also readily complied with all the
conditions imposed by the learned trial court. The further undertaking of the
respondents-plaintiffs to deposit a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- per annum during the
pendency of this appeal, which of course is subject to final decision of this
appeal of the respondents-defendants further shows their bonafides. Even
though, the execution of the decree under first appeal is normally stayed
where the defendants can be said to have a strong prima facie case for denying
the decree of specific performance, in the present case, however, this Court
is of the view that the main substance of the arguments of learned counsel for
the appellants- defendants is that since the respondents-plaintiffs failed to
reimburse the litigation expenses for perfection of title of the appellants-
defendants, therefore, it should be inferred that they were not ready and
willing to perform their part of the contract, does not inspire much of the
confidence specially when the appellants-defendants never specified any such
cost of litigation, which the respondents-plaintiffs refused to failed to
reimburse. On the other hand, as noted above, the respondents-plaintiffs have
more than once established their bonafides in the matter by not only
depositing the decreetal sum as directed by the learned trial court but has
also given further undertaking to deposit a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- per annum
subject to final decision of this appeal.
Therefore, in these circumstances, this Court is not inclined to stay the
execution of the decree under appeal during the pendency of this appeal.
SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  10/35 In these circumstances, while rejecting the stay
application of the appellants-defendants, this court gives liberty to the
appellants-defendants to withdraw the said deposited sum of Rs.18,00,000/- by
the respondents-plaintiffs upon furnishing of the undertaking that such
withdrawal will remain subject to the final decision of this appeal and it is
further directed that the respondents-plaintiffs shall also deposit a sum of
Rs.10,00,000/- every year commencing from 2011 before the end of June every
year with the learned trial court in pursuance of their aforesaid undertaking
given in para No.4 of the reply to the stay application under Order 41 rule 5
CPC with the trial court, which deposit shall remain subject to final decision
of this Court of the present appeal. The said deposit will, however, not be
withdrawn by the appellants-defendants during the pendency of this appeal.
The stay application of the appellant-defendants is accordingly rejected with
the aforesaid directions.
List the appeal itself for hearing along with the record of the trial court."
7\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had also referred the matter during the pendency
of the aforesaid SLP for mediation vide earlier order dated 2/11/2012 to a
retired Judge of this Court but mediation also appears to have failed and,
therefore, the appeal was contested on merits by both the learned counsels.
8\. The learned counsel for the appellant-defendants, Mr. Jitendra Chopra
mainly urged that the decree of specific performance given SBC First Appeal
No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  11/35 by the learned trial court against the present
appellant-defendants cannot be sustained because the plaintiffs failed to
comply with the conditions of the Agreement to Sell dated 28/10/1989 and
8/4/1992, as they failed to support, pursue and finance the litigation for
clearing the title of the defendants Ghasi Ram & his son Ram Singh, the
present appellant, in respect of the suit land and secondly the plaintiffs
also failed to pay the remaining consideration with the stipulated time frame
of two months and, therefore, the agreements could not be directed to be
specifically performed and that the plaintiffs could be compensated in terms
of money by refund of money, even though with interest.
9\. Mr. Jitendra Chopra also pointed out that actually the father of the
appellant-defendant-Ram Singh, Mr. Ghasi Ram had taken loan for marriage of
his son from the plaintiff's father Ram Jeevan and the said agreement was got
executed by the plaintiffs from Ghasi Ram, who was engaged in the business of
sale and purchase of lands only.
10\. Mr. Jitendra Chopra, relying upon the case laws which are referred to
hereinafter, therefore, contended that on the basis of evidence, the
plaintiffs were not entitled to the grant of decree of specific performance
and the present appeal of the defendants deserves to be allowed.

11\. On the other hand, Mr. Suresh Shrimali, Mr.Sundeep Bhandawat and Mr.
Ashok Patel appearing for the plaintiff- respondents vehemently opposed the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellants, Mr. Jitendra
Chopra, and submitted that the learned trial court painstakingly has
appreciated each and every piece of evidence led before it and in the present
case the Agreement to Sell twice over entered into by the father and son duo,
Ghasi Ram and Ram Singh, proved that the defendants having agreed to sell the
agriculture land in question only subject to the condition of clearing of
their title and once the same was cleared in 2003, they immediately offered to
pay the balance amount of consideration but since the defendants refused to
execute the sale deed, the plaintiffs filed the present suit for specific
performance. Learned counsels for the plaintiffs also submitted that the
plaintiffs had always pursued and supported the defendants in the litigation
with regard to this suit land which was pending in the courts of law and
drawing attention of the court towards the various orders, they submitted that
from time to time the plaintiffs also paid the litigation expenses including
lawyers fees in this respect and, therefore, it is wrong to contend that the
conditions of Agreement to Sell were not fulfilled by them.
12\. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that if some expenses
were incurred by the defendants with respect to same litigation, they never
put the plaintiffs to notice and details thereof for claiming reimbursement of
expenses, which could also be paid to SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh &
Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  13/35 them during the relevant time. Mr. Suresh
Shrimali, also submitted that the trial court has specifically allowed a sum
of Rs.1 lac to be paid to the defendants towards such litigation expenses,
besides giving the increase in the price on account of escalation of cost to
the extent of Rs.5,98,550/- in the impugned order, besides transferring a plot
of land of 50'x50' situated at Rawti Chandpole, Thana Road free of cost to the
defendants and, thus, these additional conditions, which have also been
complied by the plaintiffs and/or the plaintiffs are ready and willing to
comply with the same, besides the additional conditions imposed in the interim
order dated 15/4/2011, imposed by this Court and, therefore, there is no
justification in refusing the specific performance of the contract in favour
of the plaintiffs which has been given by the court below and present first
appeal of the defendants deserves to be dismissed.
13\. Learned counsels for the plaintiffs also submitted that the intention of
the defendants changed because of the escalation of prices over the long
period, which is a normal phenomenon over the period of time but that cannot
be a ground to refuse the specific performance of the contract and he also
relied upon several judgments in this regard in support of their contentions,
which are also being referred to hereinafter.
14\. I have heard the learned counsels at length and perused the record and
appreciated the evidence led before the trial court and the judgment under
appeal and judgments cited at the bar.

15\. Before proceeding further, it would be relevant to reproduce both the
Agreements to Sell in question, namely; first Agreement to Sell dated
28/10/1989 executed by the father Ghasi Ram and the subsequent Agreement to
Sell executed on 8/4/1992 by son Ram Singh, the present appellant-defendant.

                                                SBC First Appeal No.469/2009
Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  22/35
16\. From the above two agreements, the validity or the execution of which is
not even in dispute, it stands out that both the father and son; Ghasi Ram and
Ram Singh, had intended to sell the agricultural land in question to the
plaintiffs - Bhikam Chand s/o Ram Jeevan. Admittedly, part of consideration
was also received by them at the time of execution of agreement. The only
contention which is now sought to be raised against the decree of specific
performance is that the litigation expenses were not met or paid by the
plaintiffs during the contemporary period. From the evidence on record of both
the parties, namely; Ram Singh & Bhikam Chand, which was read in extenso
before this Court by the learned counsels also, it is clear that the
plaintiffs never refused to pay the said litigation expenses but on the other
hand, also paid a part of the litigation expenses at their own level even for
paying lawyers fees upto Supreme Court, but if some litigation expenses were
incurred by the defendants themselves and they never informed the plaintiffs
about the payments made by them for this litigation, then the plaintiffs
cannot be blamed for the same. There is nothing on record to show that the
plaintiffs ever raised any dispute or refused to pay such litigation cost.
17\. Over the long period for which the litigation continued, though it was
not of complex nature and only the mutation entries were to be recorded in
favour of the defendants, which were so recorded in the year 2002 only against
which the State appeal was dismissed by the Divisional Commissioner on
20/11/2003, otherwise the suit land in SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh
& Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  23/35 question was free from encumbrances and the
vacant possession was admittedly with the defendants, but the sheer length of
time in the litigation for mutation entries and perfection of title was made
upto the Supreme Court also, which all culminated in favour of the defendants
only in the year 2003 and the plaintiffs expressed their readiness and
willingness to pay the balance amount of consideration also and asked the
defendants to get the sale deed registered in their favour, which the
defendants did not do, apparently for getting the benefit of the price
escalation which took place in the meanwhile since 1989 till 2004, over a
period of 15 years and that seems to be at the bottom of the cause of filing
the present suit for specific performance by the plaintiffs.
18\. The readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiffs to perform
their part of the contract is not seriously disputed in the present case and
to compensate the defendants in the present case for the litigation expenses,
as also for the escalation of prices, the trial court has also compensated the
defendants by payment of additional price by the plaintiffs to the defendants.
Such bonafides of the plaintiffs are further proved by their undertaking
before this Court when the order dated 15/4/2011 was passed, whereby, the
plaintiffs undertook to deposit a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- every year from 2011
before the end of June and one such installment of Rs.10,00,000/- was
deposited by them in the trial court but thereafter on account of SLP filed by
the defendants against the said order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which
was ultimately disposed of by Supreme Court SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram
Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  24/35 on 31/10/2012 directing the High Court to decide
the first appeal itself and till then status quo of the property was to be
maintained and, therefore, the plaintiffs did not deposit the balance
installments of Rs.10,00,000/- for the year 2012, 2013 and 2014, which also
upon Court's query, learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiffs submitted
that the plaintiffs are ready and willing to even deposit Rs.30,00,000/-
before the trial court, if the decree of specific performance is upheld and
granted in their favour by this Court. He has also filed an affidavit of
plaintiff in this regard.
19\. Once this Court has come to the conclusion on the basis of evidence on
record that there was no lapse on the part of the plaintiffs to pay the
litigation expenses and, thus, complied with the conditions of agreements in
question, then the question of limitation and belated filing of suit in the
year 2004 for the specific performance of the Agreements of the year 1989 and
1992 cannot be decided in favour of the defendant appellants. The tenor of the
Agreements to Sell reproduced above clearly show that time was not the essence
in the present contract and the performance of the contract itself depended
upon the clearance of the title in favour of the defendants, regarding
mutation entries in their favour etc.which became final only in the year 2003
with the dismissal of State appeal by the Divisional Commissioner on
20/11/2003 and, thus, after that the plaintiffs admittedly served a notice on
the defendants on 16/8/2004 to execute the sale deed and upon their denial to
do so, the present suit was filed on 2/11/2004, which cannot be said to be SBC
First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  25/35 time barred being within a period of three years
of such denial on the part of the defendants to execute the sale deed. Thus,
the issue of limitation also deserves to be decided in favour of the
plaintiffs as there is no delay or laches on the part of the plaintiffs in
seeking the remedy by way of suit for specific performance in the present
case.
20\. The third limb of the arguments about the escalation of prices, the
plaintiffs definitely have a better case than the defendants and the specific
performance of the contract cannot be denied, merely on the ground of
escalation of prices, which is a normal phenomenon and which happens over the
long period for which the plaintiffs cannot be put to blame or any kind of
loss or prejudice and that does not vitiate the validity of agreement and
readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiffs, which are the sine
qua non factors to be established for the grant of decree of specific
performance under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. There are a
large number of decisions to support the view of this Court & of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Some of the judgments are cited below for ready reference.
21\. One more contention which was feebly raised by the learned counsel for
the appellant-defendants, Mr. Jitendra Chopra, may also be dealt with here.
Mr. Jitendra Chopra submitted that on the anvil of Section 29 of the Indian
Contract Act, 1872, the Agreements, meaning of which is not certain, or
capable of being made certain, are void. Mr. Jitendra Chopra submitted that
since the title of the land SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs.
Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  26/35 in question was not perfect at the time of
entering into the Agreement, therefore, there was uncertainty about the
Agreement and that renders the contract itself invalid. The said contention is
not only unsustainable but is adequately answered by Section 43 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which provides that transfer by unauthorized
person, who subsequently acquires interest in property transferred, will also
be valid and even if a person fradulently or erroneously represents that he is
authorized to transfer certain immovable property and professes to transfer
such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the
transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such
property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists.
Similarly, Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 also permits
transfer by ostensible owner and such contracts are not voidable, much less
void.
22\. In the present case, there was no dispute about the title of the
defendants nor the validity of the person entering into the contract, Ghasi
Ram in the first instance and the defendant son, Ram Singh in the second
Agreement and, therefore, the contention raised by the learned counsel for the
appellant-defendants is devoid of merit and same is hereby rejected.
23\. In Nirmala Anand vs. Advent Corporation (P) Ltd. & Ors. - (2002) 8 SCC
146, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that grant of SBC First Appeal No.469/2009
Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  27/35 decree of specific performance lies in the
discretion of the Court and it is also well settled that it is not always
necessary to grant the specific performance simply for the reason that it is
legal or lawful do to so but ordinarily the plaintiff should not be denied
relief of specific performance only on account of phenomenal increase in price
of land during the pendency of the litigation. That may be, in a given case,
one of the considerations besides many others to be taken into account for
refusing the decree of specific performance. As a general rule, it cannot be
held that ordinarily the plaintiff cannot be allowed to have, for him alone,
the entire benefit of such increase in the value of the property during the
pendency of the litigation and while balancing the equities, the Court may
take into account the undue advantage of one party over the other as also the
hardship that may be caused to the defendant by directing specific
performance.
24\. In S.V.R.Mudaliar vs. Mrs. Rajabu F. Buhari \- AIR 1995 SC 1607, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held in para 27 that if merely because prices have risen
during the pendency of litigation, the Court was to deny the relief of
specific performance if otherwise due, this relief could hardly be granted in
any case, because by the time the litigation comes to an end sufficiently long
period is likely to elapse in most of the cases. This factor, therefore,
should not normally weigh against the suitor in exercise of discretion by a
Court in a case of the present nature.
SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  28/35
25\. In Laxman Tatyaba Kankate & Ors. vs. Taramath Harishchandra Dhatrak \-
(2010) 7 SCC 717, in para 25 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court again
reiterated that price increase over the period of time cannot be a ground for
denying the decree of specific performance to the respondent and in that case
the respondent voluntarily undertook to pay higher price of Rs.1,50,000/-
instead of Rs.40,000/- as a total consideration, the Court finding the said
offer to be very fair, upheld the decree of specific performance in that case.
26\. This Court in the case of Lahiri vs. Prem Prakash\- AIR 2007 (Raj.) 85
had elaborately dealt with this aspect and categorically held that price
escalation cannot be a good ground to deny the specific performance of the
contract. Relying upon various precedents from Hon'ble Supreme Court, this
Court held as under:-
> "7. Shri R.K.Jain, learned opposite counsel however contested its position
> and relied upon the following judgments in support of his submissions; (i)
> Continental Construction Co.Ltd. V/s State of Madhya Pradesh (1988) 3 SCC
> 82, (ii) P.C.Varghese vs. Devaki Amma Balambika Devi and others (2005) 8 SCC
> 486) and (iii) Rameshwar & Anr. V/s Hakim Mohd. Ibadullah Khan (S.B.Civil
> First Appeal No.101/1986, decided by this Court on 30.8.2006).
> On the strength of these precedents, the learned counsel contended that mere
> price increase is no ground to deny the specific performance of the contract
> by the defendant nor the character of the property being a joint property
> can sustain such denial.
> 8\. Having heard learned counsel and upon perusal of the pleadings, evidence
> and cited case laws, this Court is of the SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram
> Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  29/35 opinion that the present appeal has no force and
deserves to be dismissed.
9\. This Court while relying on various Supreme Court decisions held in
Rameshwar & another v/s Hakim Mohd. Ibdullah Khan's case (surpa) as under:
"The time elapsing in the litigation in such cases of specific performance is
bound to give rise to these kinds of considerations and prices of properties
are bound to increase in all towns and cities for a variety of reasons. If the
rights of plaintiff were to be defeated only on such considerations under the
guise of principles of natural justice, then decree of specific performance
cannot be granted in any case. But that is not the law and the law as
expounded by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the afore-noted citations is very clear
and is contrary to the aforesaid proposition as taken by the learned trial
court."
10\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.C.Varghese's case has held that in view of
Section 22(1)(a) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, the court could grant a
decree for partition and separate possession of the property in addition to a
decree for specific performance of contract. In the case before the Hon'ble
Surpeme Court, the appellant had relinquished his claim in respect of the
property belonging to the minor and he also prayed for a decree for partition
and such a prayer having been allowed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that no
exception could be taken to the decree of the learned trial court granting
decree for partition and possession besides the decree for specific
performance. Relying on this ration, this can be safely held that the
defendant Lahiri was entitled to sell his specified and determined 1/4th share
of the property namely agricultural land in question. Therefore, the character
of the property to be joint between the four brothers cannot deter this court
or even could not have deterred the learned trial court in upholding such
decree for specific performance. This is further fortified by the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs.
Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  30/35 Continental Construction's case (supra), wherein
the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that a contract is not frustrated merely
because the circumstances in which the contract was made stand altered. The
Contract Act does not enable a party to a contract to ignore the express
covenants thereof, and to claim payment of consideration for performance of
the contract at rates different from the stipulated rates, on some vague plea
of equity. The parties to an executory contract are often faced, in the course
of carrying it out, with a turn of events which they did not at all
anticipate, a wholly abnormal rise or fall in prices, a sudden depreciation of
currency, an unexpected obstacle to execution, or the like. There is no
general liberty reserved to the courts to absolve a party from liability to
perform his part of the contract merely because on account of an
uncontemplated turn of events, the performance of the contract may become
onerous.
11\. In view of this legal position, this court is of the firm opinion that
the specific performance of the contract awarded by the learned trial court is
neither required to be upset nor reversed merely on the basis of the normal
change in the circumstances namely the price difference over the period. So
long as the validity and veracity of the Agreement to Sell Ex.1 cannot be
successfully assailed on the basis of the principles incorporated in the
Contract Act, and which has not been done in the present case, the use of
discretion by the courts in favour of the enforcement of valid contract is
only fair and is not required to be disturbed.
12\. Consequently, this Court finds no force in this appeal and the same is
liable to be dismissed. The defendant shall execute the sale-deed of his 1/4th
share of the agricultural land now within a period of three months from today
in favour of plaintiff Prem Prakash who shall pay the remaining amount of
consideration of Rs.11,000/- to the defendant at the time of registration of
such sale-deed. It is needless to add that if there are bank due against
defendant Lahiri with respect to the charge over the said 1/4th share, still
subsisting, the said amount of Rs.11,000/- so paid to the defendant now, will
remain under the charge of the bank. The decree be made accordingly."
> SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
> Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  31/35
27\. On the other hand, in Satya Jain vs. Anis Ahmed Rushdie \- 2013 DNJ (SC)
127 also the Hon'ble Supreme Court granted the decree of specific performance
even though the time period lapsed in obtained the Income Tax Clearance
Certificate from the Income Tax Authorities and in that process the time
lapsed did not vitiate the Agreement and the specific performance should not
be denied on the basis of escalation of prices during the said period.
28\. The judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant-
defendants in the case of Baldev Raj Chopra vs. Rakesh Kumar \- 2013(4) WLC
(Raj.) 220, where, the learned Single Judge of this Court held that the
compensation instead of specific performance would be a reasonable relief in
favour of the plaintiff was rendered in the context of it being a case of
transfer of residential house No.130, `E' Block, Sri Ganganagar, measuring
32'x50' for the consideration of Rs.40,000/- and also the court found that the
plaintiff was lacking readiness and willingness to perform his part of the
contract and, therefore, instead of specific performance, compensation to the
plaintiff would be adequate. The Court also found that the consideration for
transfer of property was inadequate.
No such factors are available in the present case in favour of the appellant-
defendants and not only the consideration at the time of Agreements to Sell
was adequate but enhanced compensation has also been awarded by the learned
trial court and some additional SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors.
vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  32/35 enhancement can also be considered by this Court
while upholding the said decree of specific performance now, in the light of
interim order dated 15/4/2011, upheld by Supreme Court also.
29\. In the case of Mrs. Saradamani Kandappan vs. Mrs. S.Rajalakshmi & Ors.-
2011 (2) WLC (SC) 632 relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant-
defendants, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that though suit for specific
performance need not be decreed merely because it is filed within the period
of limitation by ignoring the time-limits stipulated in the agreement and the
Courts will also frown upon suits which are not filed immediately after the
breach/refusal. The fact that limitation is three years does not mean a
purchaser can wait for 1 or 2 years to file a suit and obtain specific
performance. The three years period is intended to assist purchasers in
special cases, as for example, where the major part of the consideration has
been paid to the vendor and possession has been delivered in part performance,
where equity shifts in favour of the purchaser.
This judgment is also of no assistance to the appellant- defendants herein but
may rather help the plaintiffs because in the present case the trial court as
well as this Court has clearly found that breach or refusal on the part of the
defendants took place only after the service of notice by the plaintiffs on
16/8/2004, when the mutation entires were finally recorded in favour of the
defendants after the order of the Divisional Commissioner dated 20/11/2003 was
SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  33/35 passed and the suit was filed on 2/11/2004,
therefore, there is no delay or breach of limitation on the part of the
plaintiffs in the present case.
30\. In Faquir Chand vs. Sudesh Kumari \- 2006(4) Civil Court Cases (SC) 347,
relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant-defendants, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that where the plaintiff was also responsible to some
extent for delay of decision of suit, while granting specific relief, the
plaintiff could be directed to pay additional sum to compensate the
defendants.
Though in the present case, the present plaintiffs was not at all responsible
for delay caused in perfecting the title of the defendants and they had also
cooperated in the litigation also and they also compensated the defendants by
way of meeting the litigation cost, still the trial court has already awarded
additional compensation to the defendants by way of rise in price during the
said period of litigation and also the litigation costs to the extent of
Rs.1,00,000/-. Thus, this judgment also instead of supporting the defendant-
appellants may support the plaintiff-respondents in the present case.
Thus, on an over all analysis of the factual and legal spectrum of the present
case, this Court is satisfied that the decree given for specific performance
in favour of the plaintiff-respondents deserves to be upheld subject to the
following directions to the parties:-
> SBC First Appeal No.469/2009 Ram Singh & Ors. vs. Bhikam Chand & Ors.
Judgment dt: 28/1/2015  34/35
