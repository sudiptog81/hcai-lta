                                    ORDER
Per Bench These are cross appeals against the order of the Commissioner of
Income-tax(Appeals) I, Hyderabad dated 11.06.2012 for the assessment year
2008-09.
2\. Assessee has raised the following grounds in its appeal-
> "1. The learned CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad erred in confirming the total income of
> the Appellant at Rs.6,43,20,260/- as against the returned income of
> Rs.63,77,632 without appreciating the fact and circumstance of the case.
> 2\. The learned CIT(A) -I, Hyderabad having found as a matter of fact that
> the Appellant had offered the income in the original return of income filed
> much before the date of search, ought to have a nulled the entire 153C
> proceedings as no Undisclosed documents were found in relation to the
> disclosed transaction by the Appellant , and hence the order passed by the
> learned CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad is wholly unsustainable and is to be quashed.
> 3\. The learned CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad ought to have clearly held that the
> proceedings u/s. 153C of the I.T. Act 1961 initiated against the Appellant
> was on a wrong foundation of reasoning arising out of presumptions,
> assumptions and reappraisal of the same set of facts in respect of a
> disclosed transaction much before the date of search and was thus not
> capable of being upheld statutorily or otherwise and therefore the order
> passed by the A.O. ought to have been quashed by the learned CIT(A)-I.
> 4\. The learned CIT(A) I, Hyderabad ought to have clearly held that the
> extinguishment of debt redeemed with the financial institutions resulted in
> a notional surplus/surplus on capital account not exigible to tax. The
> learned CIT(A) I ought to have deleted the entire amount of
> Rs.42,20,31,114/- which included the sum of Rs.6,43,20,260/- sustained by
> the learned CIT(A)-I.
> 5\. The learned CIT(A) I, Hyderabad erred in treating the alleged gains out
> of transfer of the shares as 'Business Income', without appreciating the
> facts that the Appellant held the shares as investment. The impugned
> transaction cannot be deemed to be an  3 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s.
> A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad adventure in the nature of
> trade. Thus, the addition of Rs.6,43,20,260/- is not justified and the same
> may be deleted.
> 6\. Without prejudice to grounds No.2 to 5, the learned CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad
> failed to appreciate that the ad-hoc addition to adopt the share value at
> Rs.10/- per share for the purpose of computing profits on sale of shares by
> the appellant Company is a notional income and same is on presumption and
> surmises. Thus, the addition of Rs.6,43,20,260/- is not justified and the
> same may be deleted.
> 7\. The learned CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad failed to note that there was no
> provision in the Income Tax Act 1961 to substitute the price of share with
> any value when the contracted value of the shares between the parties was
> not doubted and therefore erred in sustaining the addition of
> Rs.6,43,20,260/-.
> 8\. The learned CIT(A)-I Hyderabad and Assessing Officer erred in levying
> interest under section 234B and section 234D without appreciating the fact
> that the appellant denies liability to pay the same. Hence, the same are not
> leviable.
9 ......"
The assessee, vide letter dated 27.9.2012 has raised additional grounds, which
are as under-
"1. The Assessment Order passed under section 143(3) r.w.s. 153C is void-ab-
initio and bad in law as the Appellant was never served with any notice
initiating the proceedings under section 153C.
2\. The notice dated 28/04/2010 is without any jurisdiction and the same is
bad in law. Thus, the Assessment Oder passed under section 143(3) r.w.s.153C
dated 29/12/2011, is bad in law and the same may be quashed.
3\. The jurisdiction under section 153C has not been validly invoked since no
proper and relevant documents necessary for invoking the same were found
during the search and hence the assessment under section 153C was invalid and
illegal.
4\. ..........."
These additional grounds, being legal in nature, are admitted.
4 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
3\. The Revenue in its appeal has raised the following grounds-
> "1. The order of the CIT(A) is erroneous both on facts and in law.
> 2\. The CIT(A) is not justified in restricting the addition made on account
> of profit earned on debt assignment to Rs.6,43,20,260 as against
> Rs.42,20,114/- arrived at by the Assessing Officer.
> 3\. The CIT(A) is not correct in adopting the value of Share of LVS Power
> Ltd. at Rs.10/- per share instead of Rs.50 /- as adopted by the Assessing
> Officer.
> 4\. The CIT(A) ought to have appreciated the fact that the assessee company
> itself has adopted the value at Rs.50/- per share in its books of account
> while recording the transaction of debt assignment.
> 5\. The CIT(A) ought to have ordered for addition of Rs.5,30,23,056/- of
> interest received by the assessee from LVS Power Ltd., during the year as
> noted in Su-Para 4 of 4.5.1 of the Assessment order, when he differed with
> the figures adopted by the Assessing Officer.
> 6\. .....
4\. Briefly stated facts of the case are that action u/s.132 of the I.T. Act
was initiated in the case of one A. Venkat Rama Reddy and his family companies
on 20-08-2009. In the course of search proceedings in the above case, certain
documents and loose sheets belonged to the assessee were seized from the
residence of A.Venkat Rama Reddy as well as in the business premises of M/s.
L.V.S. Power Ltd. Consequently notice under section 153C was issued to the
assessee company, in response to which assessee filed its return of income for
the assessment year 2008-09 on 03-06-2010 disclosing total income of Rs.
63,77,632/- which is reiteration of the original income returned on
22-09-2008. During assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer observed that
M/s. LVS Power Ltd with its registered office at D.No.8- 2-269/5/90, Sagar
Coop. Society, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad was incorporated under Companies Act
with a paid up share capital of Rs. 45,80,68,980/-. It has entered into an
agreement with AP Transco to the effect that it has to keep its power plant in
back down/ready to operate condition and in return receiving fixed costs from
the AP Transco and claimed deduction under  5 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s.
A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad S.80IA(iv). Further, the
Assessing Officer observed that M/s. ASP Software Solutions Pvt Ltd (assessee
in question) was incorporated under Companies Act with its registered office
at H.No.3-4-872/3, Barkatpura, Hyderabad with a paid up share capital of
Rs.1,95,24,290/- and engaged in software development. The assessee company is
one of the major share holder in M/s. LVS Power Ltd with 60,00,000 shares
having 13.10% in the paid up capital. In the assessment order, the Assessing
Officer has detailed the facts and figures relating to the turnover and profit
of the assessee company in a tabular form at page 3 para 1.2 as per which up
to assessment year 2007- 08, net profit was shown at loss only and only in the
current assessment year a net profit of Rs.95.63 lakhs was shown. Shri
Venkatesh Reddy is the Managing Director of the assessee company with 98.29%
share holding.
5\. M/s. LVS Power Ltd had an accumulated debt along with interest of Rs. 73.9
crores payable to various financial institutions such as lDBI, IFCI and Bank
of Baroda etc. Due to its failure to service the debt, the financial
institutions had assigned the debt to the assessee company by a separate Debt
Assignment Deeds with lDBI, BOB and IFCI on various dates. As per the same,
the assessee company should pay Rs.33,67,00,045/- being the debt payable by
the LVS Power to the said institutions. An MOU was entered with LVS Power Ltd
by the assessee company and fulfilled its obligation by liquidating the
required sum by paying to the financial institutions. As per the MOU,M/s.LVS
Power would offer equity in the event of default, as part payment based on the
valuation of the Chartered Accountants. Accordingly, they engaged M/s. Surya
Chandra &Associates, Hyderabad to ascertain its net worth of M/s. LVS Power
Ltd vide valuation report dated 31-12-2007 and arrived at the share value at
Rs.55.82/- (face value Rs.10/-). M/s. LVS Power Ltd has repaid its debt
towards financial institutions to the assessee company by cheques on various
dates and also by allotment of shares of 89,42,772 @  6 ITA No.1175 &
1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad Rs.50/- per
share, totalling Rs.44,71,38,600/-. In brief, the assessee company has settled
the debt to the tune of Rs.78.39 crores by paying Rs.33.67 crores to the Fls
and made a profit of Rs.42.20 crores.
6\. The shares thus acquired by the assessee company were sold to one Shri
A.Raghava Reddy and one Shri A.Jaipal Reddy who are having business relations
with Venkata Rama Reddy for Rs4.OO and Rs.3.75 respectively on 21-02-2008 who
in turn sold all the shares to one Shri Narasimha Reddy for Rs.2.25/-. Shri
Narasimha Reddy again sold all the shares to Shri A.Venkata Rama Reddy on
14-10-2008 at Rs.2.24 per share. On its part, assessee company made a net
profit of Rs.95,52,935/- in the entire transaction. Out of this, the assessee
had set off the brought forward depreciation of Rs.31,76,886/- and offered
Rs.63,77,632/- to tax.
7\. The Assessing Officer observed that the discount of 96% at which shares of
M/s.LVS Power Ltd are sold to the Managing Director of the company from which
shares were originated in a span of three months speak the grandness of tax
evasive design made by the assessee company by introducing certain name
lenders who have intimate business connections with the assessee group.
Further observed that it is only an artificial suppression of share price just
to avoid tax and circumvent the provisions of the law. The method followed by
the assessee is was held to be dubious and alien to the known principles of
accounting and not recognized by the IT. Act. It has clubbed two transactions
to suit its design viz. receipt of consideration in shares and sale of the
same. The payment received by the assessee by way of allotment of shares by
M/s. LVS Power Ltd was a part consideration in a scheme of debt assignment
whereas sale of those shares by the assessee company is application of assets
acquired and thus it is a totally different transaction altogether. By
clubbing these two things and by  7 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P.
Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad artificially suppressing the share
value without any basis, assessee tried to get a way by offering just
Rs.95,53,OOO/- as against a business profit of Rs.44.71 crores earned by
adventuring into debt assignment. The Assessing Officer during assessment
proceedings asked the assessee to explain as to why the net profit earned in
debt assignment cannot be brought to tax. In reply the assessee stated that
the transaction is capital in nature and therefore cannot be taxed as revenue
receipt. The Assessing Officer rejected the explanation of the assessee for
the reason that assessee itself had offered the profit made out of debt
assignment as business income and what is to be decided is the quantum of such
income. On the contention of assessee that the receipt is capital in nature,
the Assessing Officer further held that the assessee had entered into debt
assignment agreement with all the FIs and MOU with LVS during the financial
year 2006-07 relevant to AY 2007-08 itself. The total debt has not been taken
into its balance sheet and only the amounts paid to banks have been shown as
an investment in LVS Power Ltd. In AY 2008-09, there is no entry in the
balance sheet on the debt assignment. The ledgers of debt assignment and
capital reserve submitted by the assessee along with reply is only an
afterthought and not part of neither the seized material nor it was submitted
by the assessee during assessment proceedings. The Assessing Officer brushed
aside the explanation of the assessee that it had inadvertently taken the
surplus on account of debt assignment as income by wrong advice/guidance for
the finding that assessee set off the carry forward losses to the tune of
Rs.31 lakhs from out of income earned on debt assignment.
8\. The Assessing Officer held that assessee adopted a grand tax evasive
design in a systematic way by - (i) assigning the debt to it,
(ii)diluting the existing shares of LVS Power Ltd, (iii) allotting the shares
to assessee company by LVS Power Ltd at Rs.5O/-per share, (iv) routing these
8 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad shares through pre-arranged name lenders viz A.Jaipal Reddy and A.
Raghava Reddy and A.Narasimha Reddy and (v) finally channelizing the entire
set of 89,42,772 shares to Venkat Rama Reddy, MD of M/s. LVS Power Ltd and of
the assessee company (presently known as Venkateswara Financiers). The
Assessing Officer took support from the clause in the MOU signed by M/s. LVS
Power Ltd and the assessee company on 23-12-2006 wherein it was provided that
interest @ 16.11% starting from 01-04-2007 is payable which is enough evidence
to prove that the transaction is revenue in nature but not in the capital
field as claimed by the assessee. The Assessing Officer also relied on the
subsequent events that M/s. LVS Power Ltd had sold their shares @ Rs.27/- per
share to M/s.Green Co Ltd during the previous year relevant to assessment year
2011-12 besides getting a dividend of Rs4/- per share during the financial
year relevant to assessment year 2010- 11 which shows that share value of
Rs.5O/- adopted by the company was real and the sale of shares at Rs4/- and
Rs.3.75 to relatives of the management of M/s. LVS Power Ltd by the assessee
is a stage managed one. The Assessing Officer held that it is the case of
suppression of actual price and creating artificial price for the share to
avoid tax liability and circumvent the provisions of law. The AO also observed
that the name lenders Shri A.Jaipal Reddy, Shri Raghava Reddy and Shri
Narasimha Reddy in their sworn depositions gave stereo typed replies stating
that they had purchased the shares because they were offered at a lesser price
than its face value. They had sold the shares within 6 months because the
share price was not listed at the rate they expected and in the process
incurred losses but this loss was not claimed by them in their books. The
Assessing Officer held that they failed to establish that they had genuine
interest of making money by purchase of these shares.
9\. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, the Assessing Officer held that the
nature of income earned by the assessee is covered u/s.28 of I.T.
9 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad Act and not capital as
claimed by the assessee. The Assessing Officer brought the profit earned on
debt assignment of Rs.42,20,31,114/- to tax. The income was thus assessed at
Rs. 42,84,08,746/-.
10\. Before the CIT(A), it was contended that the proceedings under S.153C
were wrongly initiated as there was no incriminating material and further, on
merits, it was contended that there was no profit realised to the extent of
Rs.42,20,31,114 brought to tax by the Assessing Officer, and further, the
Assessing Officer did not appreciate the entire transaction, and should have
accepted the income offered. The assessee has raised various grounds, running
into 18 before the CIT(A). The CIT(A) has considered the issue whether the
provisions of S.153C are proper or not and held that in view of seizure of
documents, S.153C were validly initiated by the Assessing Officer. With
reference to the issue of computation of profit made by the Assessing Officer,
while accepting that the assessee has correctly taken the valuation of shares
at Rs.50 and has recorded the same in the books, he found that there is no
justification to interfere with the value adopted by the Assessing Officer in
respect of the shares received by the assessee company, in view of debt
assignment which is as per the accounts. He further held that the Assessing
Officer was not correct in computing the profit upto the date of allotment of
shares ignoring that subsequent sale of shares and therefore, the profit
brought to tax by the Assessing Officer was deleted. However, he did not
accept that the sale price of the shares could be so low as contended by the
assessee, and therefore, he went on to fix the fair share value at Rs.10 for
the purpose of computing the profits on sale of shares. Therefore, as against
Rs.3,46,60,399 sale proceeds accounted by the assessee company in the books of
account, the CIT(A) re-determined the sale price at Rs.10 crores, thereby
making an addition of Rs.6,43,20,260. Accordingly, both the parties are
aggrieved.
10 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
11\. With reference to the assessee's appeal, the learned counsel made three-
fold submissions. Firstly, that the notice issued under S.153A dated 28.4.2010
is without jurisdiction and completion of proceedings under S.153C is not
correct. With reference to the documents found and seized stated to be
incriminating, it was submitted that the documents seized were nothing but MOU
entered by the assessee company, annual report and copies of the share
certificates, the details of which are already mentioned in the annual report
and placed before the authorities before the search. Therefore, these
documents are not incriminating and the proceedings under S.153C could not be
initiated, and further there is no satisfaction recorded by the Assessing
Officer and in support, he filed the order sheets of the assessee company and
as well as the order sheet of LVS Power Ltd., the other company, to contend
that there is no satisfaction recorded by the Assessing Officer. In this
regard, it was submitted that the notice under S.153A is not valid as there
was neither search action under S.132 nor requisition under S.132A against the
assessee. Thus, notice issued under S.153A is without any jurisdiction. Hence,
the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer was without proper notice
is bad in law and void ab initio. It is submitted the order under S.143(3)read
with S.153C passed is liable to be quashed. In support of this proposition,
reliance is placed ont eh decision of Allahabad High Court in the case of CIT
V/s. Shital Prasad Kharag Prasad(280 ITR 541). It is further submitted that
the notice was issued under S.153A and no notice under S.153C was issued. For
that reason also, it is submitted that the assessment order dated 29.12.2011
passed under S.143(3) read with S.153C is bad in law. It is further submitted
at this juncture that the protection under S.292B or S.292BB cannot be
extended to a notice where the issue pertains to assumption of jurisdiction.
11 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
12\. Secondly, it was submitted that there is no satisfaction recorded by the
Assessing Officer to indicate that the documents found and seized during the
course of search are incriminating. The documents found during the course of
search action has not unearthed any transaction not disclosed to the
department by the assessee. In the absence of any such satisfaction, the
proceedings initiated under S.153A culminated into order under S.143(3) read
with S.153C dated 29.12.2010 is bad in law and void ab initio. In this
context, the learned counsel placed reliance on the following decisions-
> (a) Decision of Bombay Bench 'H of the Tribunal in the case of Bejay
> Securities & Finance Ltd. V/s. ACIT (ITA No.4859 to 4865/Mum/2009 AYs
> 2001-02 to 2007-08) dated 24.6.2011;
> (b) Decision of Bombay Bench 'H' of the Tribunal in the case of Anil
> P.Khimani V./s. Dy. CIT (ITA No.2855 to 2860/Mum/2008 for assessment years
> 1999-2000 to 20004-05) dated 23.2.2010;
> (c) Jindal Stainless Learned. V/s. ACIT(120 ITD 301)-Del.
> (d) Singhad Technical Education Society V/s. ACIT (140 TTJ 233)-
> Pune.
> (e) SSP Aviation Ltd. V/s. DCIT (346 ITR 177)-Del.
> (f) Ingram Micro (India) Exports V/s. DDIT ITAT (Mumbai)
13\. The third contention is with reference to merits in relation to which it
is stated that the Assessing Officer as well as the CIT(A) have failed to
appreciate the transaction. The assessee acquired the debt amounting to
Rs.73.9 cores as an actionable claim from the financial institutions viz.
IDBI, IFCI and BOB recoverable from LVS Power Ltd. and payment of
R.33,67,00,045 out of the borrowed capital and incurred an interest
expenditure of Rs.3,11,71,871. The assessee out of the debt of Rs.73.9  12 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
crores recovered Rs.33,67,64,456 and remaining debt along with the interest
thereon was converted into equity shares of LVS Power Ltd. The equity shares
numbering 89,42,722 were subsequently sold for a total consideration of
Rs.3,46,60,395 and the gains of Rs.95,52,935 was offered to tax. The assessee,
therefore, submitted that the Assessing Officer is not justified in treating
the allotment of shares as a receipt of Rs.44,71,38,600 and making an addition
of Rs.42,20,31,114 to the income of the assessee.
14\. Alternately, it was further submitted by the learned counsel for the
assessee that it is only the debt which has been converted into equity shares,
and since such conversion does not amount to transfer, it does not give rise
to any taxable event. In this behalf, reliance is placed on the following-
> (i) CBDT Circular No.621 dated 19th December, 1991(1992) 195 ITR (ST) 154
> (ii) Memorandum Explaining the Provisions in the finance (No.2) Bill,
> 1991(1991) 190 ITR (St) 270).
The learned counsel for the assessee also submitted that the computation of
gains has to be made considering the cost of acquisition of the debt and not
on the basis of some notional figure. In support of this proposition, he
relied on the decisions of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in Titan
Investment & Finance Co. Ltd. V/s. ITO (75 ITD 441) and ITO V/s. Essar
Teleholdings (2009) 30 DTR (Mum)(Trib)273.
15\. The learned counsel for the assessee further submitted that Assessing
Officer has made the addition on allotment of shares ignoring the subsequent
transfer of the shares for a consideration. The allotment of shares  13 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
against the debt is a tax neutral event, as the cost of acquisition of the
shares remains to be the cost at which the debt is acquired. Hence, the action
of the Assessing Officer in making the addition of Rs.42,20.31,114 is not
justified. It is further submitted that the CIT(A) is not justified in
replacing the actual sale consideration with a notional figure of sale
consideration. The addition of Rs.6,43,20,260, thus made, is not at all
justified and the same may be deleted. Reliance in this behalf is placed on
the decision of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Rupee Finance
& Management (P) Ltd. V/s. ACIT (129 ITD 539).
16\. The learned counsel for the assessee further contended that the assessee
has invested in the shares of LVS Power Ltd. in the year 2001. The debt of LVS
Power Ltd. was acquired by assessee to protect the initial interest. Thus, the
entire transaction is an investment and not an adventure in the nature of
trade. In support of this contention, reliance is placed on the following
decisions of the Calcutta High Court
(a) CIT V/s. Guest Keen & Nettlefold Ltd. (115 ITR 205)
(b) CIT V/s. Calcutta Discount Co.(P)Ltd (1672 ITR 680).
17\. In reply, the Learned Departmental Representative submitted on the
preliminary legal issue, that all that section 153C contemplates is that
during the course of search material pertaining to another persons should be
found and there should be no ambiguity as to whom the material pertains. If
the Assessing Officer is satisfied that the seized material pertains to
another person, he can initiate proceedings under S.153C. The satisfaction is
with regard to the ownership of the document and not regarding quantification
or amount of undisclosed income. In this behalf, he placed reliance on the  14
ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad decision of Bilaspur Bench of the Tribunal in the case of ACITV/s.
Panchuram Deshmukh and Others (133 TTJ 53).
18\. The Learned Departmental Representative with regard to the merits of the
case submitted that the MOU entered into by the assessee with M/s. LVS Power
Ltd. and the annual report carrying the transaction details regarding debt
assignment were found and seized in the course of search at A/LVS/5, as
mentioned in para 4.1 page 11 of the assessment order. The CIT(A) reiterated
this position and has dealt with this aspect on pages 15 and 16 of the
impugned order. He further submitted that the case-law relied upon by the
learned counsel for the assessee is clearly distinguishable, inasmuch as the
courts frowned upon only where frivolous and estimated additions were made
without reference to any seized material, whereas in the facts of the present
case, the documents seized throw a new light on the business transactions
carried out by the assessee through debt assignment and consequential profits
thereon, and as such the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the
assessee, have no application to the facts of the present case.
19\. As for the taxability of the business profits under S.28 of the Act, it
is submitted that the assessee itself treated the transaction as business
transaction and gave an elaborate note in its annual accounts as well as in
annual report. In this behalf, attention was invited to item 5 of Notes on
Accounts at page 150 of the paper-book. It is further submitted that the
assessee itself filed its return of income and computed the business profit
from the said debt assignment even considering the interest on loan as
expenditure. This computation was filed with the original return under
S.139(1) as well as in the return filed in response to notice under S.153C. He
further pointed out that the MOU entered into with M/s. LVS Power  15 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
provide for 16.16% of interest on part of debt taken over by the assessee from
the financial institutions. It is further submitted that taking over debt is
itself a risky transaction, and a person who takes over a debt is entering
into an activity in the nature of adventure. If he is able to recover the debt
or part of the debt, which in the first place was itself "bought" at
discounted rate, is profit. If he is not able to recover, it is a loss.
Therefore, the very activity of taking over a debt is in the nature of
adventure or trade and is, therefore, rightly assessable under S.28 of the
Act. Whether the entries are in capital side or revenue side is not really
relevant. To illustrate, it is submitted by the Learned Departmental
Representative, a person may buy a plant and machinery, make some repairs and
sell it off at a profit. Just because Plant and Machinery is capital item, the
profits derived do not take the character of capital receipt.
20\. Reconciling the figures of Business Profit (GP-interest paid) arrived at
by the Assessing Officer at Rs.42,61,92,176 and by the CIT(A) at
Rs.6,43,20,260, the Learned Departmental Representative submitted that the
main issue is whether the value of shares allotted should be adopted at Rs.50
per share or at Rs.10 per share as done by the CIT(A). The Assessing Officer
took Rs.50 per share because that is backed by the Valuation Report based on
which both the assessee and M/s.LVS Power transacted.
21\. The Learned Departmental Representative, explaining the grievance of the
Revenue in its appeal, submitted that the total debt, which was assigned and
taken over by the assessee is Rs.73.088 crores. Against this, it is pointed
out that the assessee received 8,94,27,720 shares at Rs.50 per share amounting
to Rs.44,71,38,600, leaving a balance of Rs.28.374 crores. Against this
balance, the assessee received by way of cheque payments Rs.33,67,64,450,
which resulted in excess realization of  16 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s.
A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad Rs.5,30,24,450, representing
interest received by the assessee, which should have been offered to tax, and
which accordingly gave rise to the grievance of the assessee in ground No.3 of
the Department's appeal.
22\. We have considered the rival contentions and examined the facts on
record. The issues for consideration in both appeals before us is whether the
provisions of S.153C are applicable in the assessee's case, when no
incriminating material was found. The other question to be considered is
whether the Assessing Officer was correct in considering the amount of
Rs.44.71 crores as profits in the debt transaction and the third issue to be
considered is whether the CIT(A) was right in enhancing the sale value of the
shares sold.
23\. Before adverting to the legal provisions, we may note the factual aspects
and issues in relation thereto first and then arrive at the legal contentions.
The assessee in its computation of income has taken cheques received from M/s.
LVS Power Ltd. at Rs.33,67,64,456 and the sale of shares totaling 89,42,772 at
Rs.3,46,60,395 as the 'receipts' on debt assignment activity. As against this,
the assessee deducted 'cost' by way of payment to banks of Rs.33,07,00,045 and
further reduced the interest of Rs.3,11,71,871 paid to the banks on the
borrowed funds. Therefore, on the gross receipts of Rs.3,71,42,4851, the
assessee has declared net profit of Rs.95,52,934. It was the contention of the
learned Assessing Officer that the assessee took the debt assignment totaling
to Rs.73.90 crores and the assessee has paid an amount of Rs.33,07,00,045 to
the banks as interest and hence the balance amount is profit in the debt
assignment activity. The assessee instead of taking the book value of the
shares allotted to the assessee by M/s. LVS Power Ltd., which were
subsequently sold for an amount of Rs.3.46 crores, took the sale price
directly as part of the receipts on debt assignment  17 ITA No.1175 &
1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad transaction.
Even though the assessee has considered the sale consideration as part of the
debt settlement, without making entries for adjustment to shares issued at
premium of Rs.50 and subsequent sale at discounted price, thereby incurring
loss at the time of sale of shares. The net result is the same. The Assessing
Officer ignoring the sale of shares at a loss considered the allotment of
shares at a premium as part of the debt and brought to tax the above amount of
Rs.44.71 crores. It was rightly pointed out by the Ld. CIT(A) vide his
observations in para 9.1, that Assessing Officer computed the amount of Rs.42
crores as income, taking into consideration the value of equity accepted in
the assignment of debt directly to Receipt and Payment Account as on 31st
January, 2008, instead of computing the income as on 31.3.2008, i.e. as at the
end of the year. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the CIT(A)'s order in
deleting the addition of Rs.42 cores is correct in the sense that the so-
called gains brought to tax by the Assessing Officer in the debt assignment,
gets nullified by the loss on sale of shares during the financial year itself
at a discounted price.
24\. There is no dispute with reference to the transaction of the debt
assignment, nor there is a dispute with reference to sale of shares at a
discounted price. At the relevant point of time, there is no value for the
shares of the company, M/s. LVS Power Ltd. There is also no dispute with
reference to the receipt of shares as part of the settlement of debt, which is
considered by the Assessing Officer as business activity and the conversion of
debt into shares, makes the shares a part of stock-in-trade. Therefore, in our
view, the action of the assessee in taking the net value of the receipt
towards the debt from M/s LVS and the sale value of shares as the 'receipts'
in the debt assignment, and setting off the payments to banks and interest, as
expenditure does not violate the computation of income, even though
technically speaking that may not be the way in which entries could have been
passed. Be that as it may, the net result of the transactions are that  18 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
the assessee has earned a profit of Rs.95,52,934 as shown in the books of
account. To that extent, the CIT(A)'s order in deleting of addition so made by
the Assessing Officer is to be upheld.
25\. The next issue on facts to be considered is the action of the CIT(A) in
enhancing the sale value of Rs.10 on the sale of shares of 89,42,772. As
briefly stated, the assessee has sold 45 lakh shares at Rs.4 per share and at
44,42,772 shares at Rs.3.75 per share, thereby receiving Rs.3,46,60,395 as
proceeds on the sale of shares. The assessee instead of treating the sale of
shares as a separate transaction, has taken the sale proceeds as part of debt
receipts in the debt assignment activity. Therefore, there is no occasion to
work out the cost of the shares and claim a loss in the second transaction,
since the assessee treated it as if by way of payment from M/s. LVS Power on
allotment of shares. Thus, the learned CIT(A), after accepting that there is
no profit earned in the debt transaction as was considered by the Assessing
Officer, however, went a step further and redetermined the sale price of Rs.10
per share to be reasonable and fair for the purpose of computing the profit on
sale of shares. Therefore, as against Rs.3.46 crores received by the assessee,
he directed the Assessing Officer to adopt the value of Rs.8.94 crores,
thereby making an addition of Rs.6,43,20,260.
26\. As rightly contended by the Ld. counsel for the assessee before us, the
CIT(A) does not have any power to decide the sale price under the provisions
of the Act, unless the transaction is considered as bogus or there is any
evidence to indicate that the assessee has received more than what it stated
to have received. The Income-tax Act does not permit change of sale value of
sale of shares transaction. There are provisions to redetemine the purchase
cost, if the transaction is collusive or with related parties, but  19 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
refixing the sale value by certain notional means is not permitted in law
while computing business income, except as provided specifically while
calculating Capital Gains. Moreover, in arriving at the value of the shares at
Rs.10/-, the CIT(A) has considered the subsequent sale of shares in September,
2008 to March, 2009 at Rs.10 per share by IDBI. As pointed out before us, the
investment by IDBI is with certain buy back arrangement, and accordingly, the
IDBI sold at Rs.10. Not only that, when the assessee has sold the shares at
the price which it realized, there was a hope for a positive outcome of the
litigation before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Subsequently, the prices have
fallen further, as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court went against the
assessee. On a review, the matter was reconsidered, and on that account, there
was increase in the share price at a later point of time. These events do
result in variation of price at various points of time. As seen from the
orders, the Assessing Officer did enquire with the purchasers of the shares
from the assessee company, who confirmed that they have invested money and
again sold the shares at a lesser price. Therefore, the transactions cannot be
considered as bogus or collusive. Even though the said parties may be known to
the assessee's share-holders, nothing was brought on record to establish that
the transactions are stage managed. As submitted by the assessee before the
authorities, the Director of the company was in financial constraints and has
to undertake this exercise so as to keep the company afloat consequent to the
adverse decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its litigation with A.P.
Transco initially. This financial arrangement may be required in order to keep
the companies alive. But it is not right to consider that the transactions are
collusive in nature. There is confirmation from the said parties about the
price paid for equity shares of M/s. LVS Power from the assessee, and
therefore, the action of the CIT(A) in redetermining the sale price at Rs.10
cannot be upheld.

M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
27\. Further, similar issue was considered by the Mumbai 'J' Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of Rupee Finance & Management (P) Ltd. V/s. ACIT (120 ITD
539), wherein it has been held as follows-
> "8.1 The first issue is whether the MoU in question can be considered as
> family arrangement or not. The second issue is whether the family
> arrangement is a make-belief and sham transaction. The third issue is
> whether the difference between the market value of the shares and the
> purchase price can be brought to tax in the hands of the assessee company
> under s. 69. The fourth issue is as to whether the difference in question
> referred to above, can be brought to tax in the hands of the assessee
> company under s. 28(iv).
> 8.2 We take up third and fourth issues first. Sec. 69 reads as follows :
> "69. Where in the financial year immediately preceding the assessment year
> the assessee has made investments which are not recorded in the books of
> account, if any, maintained by him for any source of income, and the
> assessee offers no explanation about the nature and source of the

> The undisputed facts in this case are that the assessee company has

> that all these investments were recorded in the books of account. Under s.
> 69 only such value of the investments may be deemed to be the income of the

> We have to mention here that it is not the case of the Revenue that the

21 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad 8.3 This brings us to
whether the difference in question can be considered as income under s. 28
(iv) ? The section reads as follows :
> "28. The following income shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head
> 'Profits and gains of business or profession',--
> (iv) the value of any benefit or perquisite, whether convertible into money
> or not, arising from business or the exercise of a profession."
Circular explaining the provisions of new s. 28(iv) at cl. 82 states as
follows :
"Assessment of the value of any benefit or perquisite arising from business or
exercise of a profession, as income from business or profession.
82\. A new cl. (iv) has been inserted in s. 28, w.e.f. 1st April, 1964, by s.
7 of the Finance Act, 1964, under which the value of any benefit or perquisite
(whether convertible in money or not) arising from business or the exercise of
a profession will be chargeable to tax under the head 'Profits and gains of
business or profession'. A corresponding amendment has been made to s. 2 (24),
including the value of such benefit or perquisite in the definition of the
term 'income' vide new sub-cl. (va) inserted in s. 2(24) by s.4(c)(i) of the
Finance Act, 1964.
83\. The effect of the above-mentioned amendment is that in respect of an
assessment for the asst. yr. 1964-65 and subsequent years, the value of any
benefit or amenity, in cash or kind, arising to an assessee from his business
or the exercise of his profession, e.g., the value of rent free residential
accommodation secured by an assessee from a company in consideration of the
professional services as a lawyer rendered by him to that company, will be
assessable in the hands of the assessee as his income under the head 'Profits
and gains of business or profession'."
The condition of invoking s. 28(iv) is that the chargeable income of the
assessee should arise from the business or in the exercise of profession.
There must be a nexus between the business of the assessee and the benefit the
assessee derived. The assessee in this case purchased certain shares at a
certain price and was required to hold these shares for a period of three
years. It is not in dispute that this was an investment made by the assessee
company hence irrespective of the fact as to whether these investments were
made in pursuance of the MoU or not,  22 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s.
A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad we are of the consideration
opinion that such investments cannot be said to be a benefit arisen out of the
business of the assessee. Moreover the assessee is the purchaser of the shares
and there is no event that has taken place during the current accounting year
which can be said to have resulted in any income being accrued or arisen to
the assessee company during the year. If at all the assessee transfers the
shares, then the benefit of profit in question can be brought to tax in those
particular years. In all the case laws relied upon by the Revenue have been
discussed by us while narrating their arguments and in these cases the tax has
been levied on the transferor and not the transferee. The effect of this
section has been explained by the CBDT in the above cited circular and from
this it is clear that, when an assessee purchases goods or assets at a price
lower than the market price, under whatever circumstances, the same cannot be
brought to tax under s. 28(iv). The section covers fringe benefits that are
availed in addition to consideration earned in carrying out a profession or
while doing business. A benefit that is passed on by one party to another, in
addition to cost or sale price, is covered in this proviso. This is clear from
the example quoted. In our humble opinion, this section cannot be invoked
under the present facts and circumstances.
8.4 Be it as it may the co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal (F-Bench, Mumbai) in
the case of Helios Food Improvers (P) Ltd. (supra) held that s. 28 is a
charging section and takes into account the receipts of specified categories
of all incomes as well as the receipts which could be generally construed as
income in the ordinary sense. But the fact remains that all the receipts
mentioned in s. 28 are inherently of income nature except in case of receipt
under a given amount of insurance policy. It also states that s. 28(iv) refers
to any benefit or perquisite and this means that such benefit or perquisite
should be in the nature of income from the very beginning or it must have
characteristics of income before it becomes chargeable at a later stage if the
original transaction is completed as designed. The Bench further observed that
the words 'benefit' or 'perquisite' have been used in the said section and
have to be read together and would draw colour from each other. Normally the
term 'perquisites' denotes meeting out of an obligation of one person by
another person either directly or indirectly or provision of some facility or
amenity by one person to another person or from the very beginning the person
providing such facility or concession knows that whatever is being done is
irretrievable to him, as it has been granted to a person as a privilege or
right of that person. Thus, it was concluded that the word 'benefit' has to be
interpreted in the same manner, that is, at the time of execution of the
business transaction one party should give to the other party an irretrievable
benefit or advantage, as an obligation or facility or a concession. In our  23
ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad opinion, only if the seller had incurred an expense or a liability
or had provided a facility to the purchaser, then the value in cash of such
expenses or benefit or perquisite shall be treated as income. In this case,
the seller has not incurred any expenses or liability or has provided a
facility. It sold its shares at a reduced price. "
Respectfully following the above, we are of the opinion that the CIT(A) has
traversed beyond the jurisdiction to re-determine the sale price, when the
Assessing Officer himself has not re-determined the sale price, nor considered
the transactions as bogus. In view of this, we are not in a position to uphold
the order of the CIT(A) in re-determining the sale price and confirming the
addition of Rs.6,43,20,260. Therefore, the assessee's grounds No.1, 6 and 7 on
this issue are allowed.
28\. Coming to the other contentions about the jurisdiction for initiation of
proceedings under S.153C, these issues have become academic in nature.
However, as seen from the additional grounds raised, and paper- book filed,
the Assessing Officer has issued a notice under S.153A when the assessee is
not a searched party. Revenue did not bring out anything on record to submit
that the notice under S.1533C has been issued. As seen from the notice itself,
this notice was issued/typed as a notice under S.153C. This was corrected by
way of ink to be that of 153A. The learned Departmental Representative was
specifically asked to enquire and place on record, whether the notice was
issued under S.153A or under S.153C. However, no information was placed on
record. As seen from the order placed on record, there is no finding by the
Assessing Officer who completed the search assessment, that these documents
pertained to the assessee. Nor there is anything in the proceedings initiated
that these are required to be considered in the case of the assessee.
Therefore, on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction itself, as the assessee is
not a searched party, notice under  24 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P.
Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad S.153A cannot be issued, and the
assessee having been issued a notice under S.153A, proceedings under S.153C
cannot be completed.
29\. Even otherwise, as seen from the facts placed on record, the documents so
seized are nothing but annual report of the assessee company along with the
Memorandum of Understanding of debt assignment and share certificates. These
do not establish any incriminating evidence of undisclosed income, so as to
enable the Assessing Officer to invoke the provisions of S.153C. As stated,
the assessee has already filed a return of income, which was processed under
S.143(1)(a). The return was filed on 22.9.2008 for assessment year 2008-09 and
the search occurred on 20th August, 2009. In fact, there was time to issue
notice under S.143(2) itself in the assessee's case immediately. Be that as it
may, as per evidence placed on record, we find that notice was issued under
S.153A on the assessee, which is not a searched party and the assessment was
completed under S.153C. Therefore, prima facie, there is no jurisdiction for
the Assessing Officer to complete the assessment in the way he did. Therefore,
the additional grounds raised by the assessee has merit, and the same are
required to be allowed.
30\. The next contention raised by the assessee with reference to the
jurisdiction was that there was no incriminating material and the documents
found and seized cannot be considered under the provisions of S.153C. This
issue along with the contention that the satisfaction was not recorded need
not be considered at present and can be examined in an appropriate case. As
stated above, on facts and on jurisdiction under S.153C, the orders passed by
the Assessing Officer and as partly confirmed by the CIT(A) are not correct,
and therefore, the assessee's contentions on these aspects are to be allowed.
25 ITA No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012
M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
31\. Another contention raised was that the transfer of shares cannot be
considered as business income. This contention is only academic in nature, as
the assessee itself has shown debt assignment as a business transaction and
offered the profit and the CIT(A)'s finding that the income has to be assessed
as business income are to be upheld. Consequently, the shares received in lieu
of the debt become stock in trade and sale thereof may result in business
loss. The Assessing Officer as well as the assessee treated the same as
business transactions. Therefore, the ground 5 raised by the assessee that it
cannot be treated as business income cannot be accepted on the facts of the
case.
32\. However, since the gain on the debt assignment gets set off by the loss
in the sale of shares, what the assessee has offered as business income has to
be accepted as appropriate one. In view of this, grounds raised by the
assessee on these issues are allowed.
33\. Ground No.8 raised by the assessee is with reference to levy of interest
under S.234B and 234D are consequential in nature and do not require any
adjudication. The Assessing Officer is directed to follow the provisions of
the Act, while levying interest under these provisions.
34\. In the result, assessee appeal is partly allowed.
35\. As for the Revenue's appeal, ITA No.1175/Hyd/2012, consequent to the
above findings given with regard to the merits of the case and also on the
point of jurisdiction, we do not find merit in the revenue's grounds. Even
though the Revenue's ground says that the assessee has received interest of
Rs.5,30,23,056, nowhere it is established that the assessee has received any
interest, and hence, the ground raised in that behalf cannot be  26 ITA
No.1175 & 1181/Hyd/2012 M/s. A.S.P. Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad
accepted. Even otherwise, since the assessee's grounds are allowed, and as it
was held that jurisdiction in assuming jurisdiction under S.153C is bad in
law, there is no merit in the grounds of the Revenue in the cross-appeal. The
same are accordingly rejected. Appeal of the Revenue, being ITA
No.1175/Hyd/2012 is dismissed.
36\. To sum up, appeal of the assessee's appeal being ITA No.1181/Hyd/2012 is
partly allowed, Revenue's appeal being ITA No.1175/Hyd/2012 is dismissed.
