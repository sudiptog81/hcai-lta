                                       ..RESPONDENT
    (BY SRI.ANAND K.NAGALGIMATH, ADV.)
         THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION
    374 R/W SEC.376 CR.P.C. BY THE ADVOCATE FOR THE
    APPELLANT/ACCUSED     AGAINST   THE     JUDGEMENT
    DT.23.03.2005 PASSED BY THE DIST. & S.J., GADAG, IN
    S.C.NO.15/03 CONVICTING THE APPELLANT-ACCUSED
    FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 498A OF IPC AND SENTENCING
    HIM TO UNDERGO S.I. FOR 1 YEAR AND TO PAY FINE OF
    RS.5,000/- I.D. TO UNDERGO IMPRISONMENT FOR 3
    MONTHS.
         THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS
    DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
                              JUDGEMENT
This appeal is by the first accused in the trial Court in S.C.No. 115/2003.
The thai Court acquitted the accused Nos. 2 and 3 and accused No.1 was
convicted for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC sentencing him
to undergo S.I. for one year and to pay a rme of ?5,000/-. AU the accused
persons were acquitted in respect of the offences under Sections 304(B), 302
r/w Section 34 of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
2\. The appellant therefore being aggrieved by his tmf conviction for the
offence punishable under Section 498A this appeal and the main contention put
forward by the appellant's counsel is that, the trial Court has committed an
error in convicting the appellant in respect of Section 498A of IPC, despite
recording the finding in favour of the accused in regard to the demand made by
this appellant for motorcycle from the parents of his wife.
