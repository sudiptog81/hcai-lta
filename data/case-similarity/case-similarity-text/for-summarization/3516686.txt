    CORAM:
    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KAIT
    SURESH KAIT, J.
1\. Vide the instant petition, the petitioner is seeking the following
reliefs:-
> "I. Issue a writ of certiorari thereby quashing the illegal opinion of the
of practice is not an healthy tactics therefore all the Ministries /
Departments were requested to follow the laid down norms without deviation and
that the power rested with the ACC should not be exercised by anyone without
the approval of ACC.
52\. The case of the petitioner was also not sent before the ACC. The
Selection Committee first selected the petitioner thereafter itself rejected
the same.
53\. In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the
Selection Committee was not the competent authority to take such decision
against the petitioner. Consequently, the opinion given by Ms. S. Usha, Vice
Chairman, IPAB vide D.O.Dy. No.9369/2010 and subsequent action taken is set
aside. I hereby direct the concerned Ministry that the case of the petitioner
be put up before the ACC. Thereafter, the said authority shall take decision
on the fate of the petitioner.
54\. In view of the above, instant petition stands disposed of with no W.P (C)
No. 6299/2011 Page 23 of 24 order as to costs.

2\. In brief, the facts of the case are that Department of Industrial Policy
and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, on behalf of IPAB published
advertisement in „Hindustan Times‟ on 04.09.2010 inviting applications, from
Advocates having specialised brief experience in Trademarks and Patents, for
two posts of Member Technical in Trademarks (one rolled over vacancy of
February, 2010) and one vacancy in Patents.
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 2 of 24
3\. Pursuant to the above advertisement, the petitioner applied and sent his
bio-data against the said vacancy of Technical Member (Trademarks) in IPAB.
4\. The respondent constituted a Search-cum-Selection Committee as per the
directions of DOPT, vide its Office Memorandum dated 30.07.2007.
5\. After the initial scrutiny of the petitioner‟s bio-data and other
documents by the respondents, he was invited to appear before the Search-cum-
Selection Committee/Interview Board for interview, in which eight candidates
(six candidates from Chennai alone) including the petitioner appeared before
the aforesaid Search-cum-Selection Committee/Interview Board.
6\. After careful assessment of the Search-cum-Selection Committee, the
petitioner was selected along with Mr. V. Ravi at the first place and
petitioner at the second number in order of merit with the rider "subject to
verification of experience in Trademarks". Thereafter, the Vice Chairman of
Intellectual Property Appellate Board, to whom this assignment was given,
opined as under:-
I. The petitioner is not in the PANDA case.

III. That Anoop Singh & Co. has not whispered about his experience.
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 3 of 24
IV. That no opposition case has been filed.
7\. Mr.Kirti Uppal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner has submitted that the qualifications of the petitioner are
extraordinary and he has long standing in Bar. For the convenience, the
qualifications and experience of the petitioner is mentioned as under:-
> "QUALIFICATION OF THE PETITIONER: ● Appeared for final year LL.M.(IPR)

> the Trademark registry.
> ● The due to petitioner professional expertise the petitioner has been able
> to get almost all trademark applications of his clients registered except
> few which are still where opposition proceedings yet to take place.
9\. Ld. Counsel has submitted that the statutory provisions of part VI Chapter
-II Standards of Professional Conduct and Etiquette Rules governing advocates
under Advocates Act 1961 bars the advocates from using stationery or sign
boards claiming to be specialization in any particular type of work or field
and as natural progression in career amongst IPR has to diversify in other
areas of laws also. Thus, the respondent‟s claim of asking the advocates to
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 5 of 24 submit profile to show proven specialize
experiences is contrary to the rules of Advocates Act, 1961.
10\. Learned counsel has submitted that the respondent has admitted in its
counter reply that the petitioner was selected by the Search-cum- Selection
Committee after carefully examined all the candidates called for the
interview. Therefore, the opinion of the Vice Chairman is contrary to factual
position and the record as well. For the convenience, as submitted by counsel
for the petitioner, a chart is prepared as under:-
> S.No. OPINION REPORT OF OPINION REPORT OF THE VICE CHAIRMAN THE VICE
> CHAIRMAN IS BAD ON THE FOLLOWING:
> 1\. The petitioner name is not The Ld. Vice Chairman has in the PANDA Case.
> claimed in her report that the petitioner‟s name does not appear in „Panda

> more that 5 opposition, which are still pending where opposition proceedings

> Now New Trademark Agent number is 5682.
11\. Learned Senior counsel has further submitted that the Vice Chairman has
erroneously and malafidely assessed the cases filed by the petitioner, which
is not permissible under the law. The respondent could not have delegated the
powers of verification as the respondent W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 7 of 24
was only to collect the documents and was to forward it to the ACC, as the
ultimate authority is vested with it.
12\. The DOPT has laid down guidelines under Clause 5 (V), which says that
"The panel recommended by the Committee will have to be accepted in toto by
the Ministry/Department. Any deviation in the matter will require the prior
approval of the ACC." Therefore, any proposal to reject the re-commendations
will require the approval of ACC, which is absent in the present case.
13\. Moreover, as per the DOPT circular guidelines under Clause 5(I) to (X),
OM No. 28113/2006-EO (SM II) dated 03.07.2006, the respondent do not enjoy the
power to cancel or reject the selection panel recommended by the Search-cum-
Selection Committee, hence their requisitioning opinion report on the guise of
verification from the Vice Chairman of IPAB and subsequent acceptance of
report and rejection of the candidature of the petitioner by the respondent is
illegal and beyond its powers, which is contrary to the directives of the
DOPT.
14\. Learned counsel has further submitted that the respondent had concealed
the facts from this Court as the Under Secretary of the respondent office had
removed hand written comments of the Secretary, DIPP as well as date from the
letter and annexed certified true copy with their reply as annexure with a
sole view to impress upon the Court that the opinion report was accepted by
the Secretary, DIPP/Chairman, Search-cum-Selection Committee. The acting Vice
Chairman has sent an undated opinion report and the same was not W.P (C) No.
6299/2011 Page 8 of 24 even on the official letter head. The respondent had
managed the said vindictive report on plain paper just to oust the petitioner
on the basis of false averments made in the report, which reads as under:-
> "● The Secretary DIPP/Chairman Search and selection committee has written
> comments on top of open space of the said opinion report which were removed
> from Court annexure is as under. QUOTE ● "It will be impossible to find
> candidates who are qualified & willing, we may think of amending the RR's
> for the future "read" sd/- RP Singh" ● Though officials of the respondent
> has annexed a camouflage report concealing the comments of the secretary
> from the annexed annexure is a perjury and deliberately for the purpose of
> obtaining favourable order and against the petitioner from the court on the
> basis of fabricated document."
15\. The learned counsel has further submitted that the respondent has used
different yardsticks in appointments of other Member Technical in IPAB.
Learned counsel has pointed out that verification of documents submitted by
Sh. Obaidur Rehman, who was appointed on the post of Member Technical
(Trademarks) in IPAB in the year 2004 relying on false case list thereby
claiming to have appeared in a trademark matter in England in the year 1935.
16\. Even bio-data of Ms. S. Usha, selected as Member Technical in IPAB shows
that she was working as Associate at the time of her appointment as Member.
She herself stated that she was associated with Mr. V. Veeraraghvan, Advocate
since 1990 preceding to her W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 9 of 24 appointment as
Member. The respondents have themselves admitted in their so called official
communication dated 18.01.2011, which is annexed with the rejoinder.
17\. In fact, on the order of merit, it was the first vacancy against which
Mr. V. Ravi has been selected which was not filed in February 2010 and the
petitioner was selected against the second vacancy for which he had applied
and which is admittedly arise only on February 2011 after the retirement of
Mr. Obaidur Rehman. Hence the alleged linking of the petitioner to the first
vacancy is irrational and mala-fide with manipulative intention to keep
petitioner away from appointment as Member technical in IPAB.
18\. Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of this Court that
after illegally cancelling the candidature of the petitioner for the post of
Member Technical (Trademarks) in IPAB, the respondent had issued a fresh
advertisement Notice No. 7(1) 2010/IPR.I/IPAB, which was published in „Times
of India‟ on 16 th April, 2011 inviting fresh applications for the post of
Member Technical (Trademarks) IPAB.
19\. The petitioner had applied and sent his bio-data to the respondent
against the advertisement mentioned above, but the respondent, in view of the
petition pending before this Court, had rejected his bio-data at very
threshold and did not call him even for the interview for the above post.
Probably, the respondent did not able to find suitable qualified candidates,
hence they published the same old W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 10 of 24
advertisement altering its advertisement notice number as 7(1)/10- IPR.I
(IPAB) in „Hindustan Times‟, Delhi dated 28.07.2012.
20\. It is submitted that as this vacancy‟s advertisement as well as the
cancellation of the appointment of the petitioner‟s candidature is under
judicial consideration, further advertisement etc. against the said vacancy
does not arise.
21\. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment delivered
by this Court on 06.08.2012 in W.P.(C) No.3660/2007, titled as Shiv Charan Lal
Sharma Vs. UOI & Ors.', which reads as under:-
> "31. Article 217 of the Constitution of India under Clause 2 provides that a
> person "shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of High Court
> unless he is a citizen of India and (a) has for at least 10 years held a
> Judicial Office in the Territory of India or (b) has for at least 10 years
> been an Advocate of High Court or of two or more such Courts in succession.
> 33\. Although a person on the select panel has no vested right to be
> appointed to the post for which he has been selected, however, the
> appointing authority cannot ignore the select panel or on its whims and
> fancies decline to make the appointment. When a person has been selected by
> the selection committee and there is a vacancy which can be offered to him,
> keeping in view his merit position then ordinarily, there is no
> justification to ignore him for appointment.
> 34\. There has to be a justifiable reason to decline to appoint a person who
> is on the select panel. In the present case, the reasons given are contrary
> to their own circular. This Court finds no material against the W.P (C) No.
> 6299/2011 Page 11 of 24 petitioner, except the reasons given in the note
> mentioned above.
> 35\. No doubt, the approval of the AC is mandatory and the final authority
> vests with the ACC. But if the selection committee has selected any
> candidate, the ACC can reject the same by giving the reasons on record,
> which is missing in the present case.
> 37\. Since the name of the petitioner has not been approved by the ACC which
> is mandatory, therefore, the respondent Ministry is directed to send the
> name of the petitioner for ACC approval. If the ACC approves the same, the
> concerned Ministry shall issue the appointment letter to the petitioner
> against the first available vacancy."
22\. On the other hand, Mr. Sachin Dutta, learned standing counsel appearing
on behalf of the respondent has submitted that the prescribed qualifications
for appointment as Technical Member (Trademarks) as laid down in Section 85
(4) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 are as under:-
> "A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Technical Member,
> unless he-
> (a) has, for at least ten years, exercised the functions of a tribunal under
> this Act or under the Trade and Merchandised Act, 1958 (43 of 1958), or
> both, and has held a post not lower than the post of a Joint Registrar for
> at least five years;
> or
> (b) has, for at least ten years , been an advocate of a proven specialized
> experience in trade mark law."
23\. He further submitted that keeping in view the responsibility, nature of
experience required and to ensure transparency, appointments W.P (C) No.
6299/2011 Page 12 of 24 to the post of Technical Member (Trademarks) have been
made by a Selection Committee, which was formed with the approval of Ministry
of Commerce and Industry, comprising of Secretary (IPP) as Chairman, Secretary
(Legal) and Secretary (DOPT) as Members.
24\. Learned standing counsel has further submitted that out of three posts of
Technical Members, (two for Trademarks and one for Patents), one post of
Technical Member (Trademarks) had fallen vacant on 22.06.2009 consequent upon
the appointment/elevation of Ms. S. Usha, Technical Member (Trademarks) to the
post of Vice Chairman, Intellectual Property Appellate Board. To fill this
vacancy, an advertisement was placed in the Employment News and in one daily
newspaper in four metropolitan cities on 27.02.2010.
25\. In pursuance thereof eight applications were received, out of which three
candidates were shortlisted. After interviewing the candidates on 13.09.2010
by the Search-cum-Selection Committee, none of the three candidates was found
fit for appointment to the post of Technical Member. There was also a need to
fill up the post of anticipated vacancy of vice Shri S. Chandrasekaran,
Technical Member (Patents) and Shri S. Obaidur Rehman, Technical Member
(Trademarks), which were likely to be vacant on 02.12.2010 and 05.02.2011
respectively. To fill these two vacancies, on 04.09.2010, an advertisement in
the Employment News and in one leading newspapers in each of the four metro
cities calling for applications from eligible and willing candidates were
invited giving one month‟s time.
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 13 of 24
26\. After the meeting of Search-cum-Selection Committee, on 13.09.2010, when
no candidates were found suitable for selection as Technical Member
(Trademarks), the Committee recommended that this post need not be re-
advertised ( as already an advertisement was given in the newspapers on
04.09.2010 for filling up one post of Technical Member) and both the posts of
Technical Member, may, therefore, be considered for filling up from amongst
the applicants who would apply against the advertisement given on 04.09.2010.
Accordingly, Secretary (IPP) opined that a corrigendum-addendum in the
advertisement be carried that number of posts will be two for Technical Member
(Trademarks) and one for Technical Member (Patents). Accordingly, a
corrigendum was issued on 30.10.2010. In response to the aforesaid
advertisement, eight applications were received for selection of Technical
Member (Trademarks) as under:-

Committee, after perusing the documents has opined as under:-
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 15 of 24
> " Please refer to your D.O. letter No.7/1/2010-IPR-I (IPAB) dated 14th

> 2\. I have perused the copies of documents sent to me for examining the

> Apart from the applications for registration, the candidate has not produced

W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 16 of 24

> 5\. I, therefore, do not approve the candidature of Shri Sanjeev KR Chaswal

31\. Learned counsel further submitted that the candidature of the petitioner
for appointment to the post of Technical Member (Trademarks) does not fulfil
the eligibility conditions as prescribed under section 85(4) (b) of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999, as mentioned in the report submitted by Ms.S.Usha, Vice-
Chairman, IPAB.
32\. The Chairman of the Search-cum-Selection Committee was apprised of the
view of the acting Chairman, IPAB about the experience of the petitioner in
Trademarks Laws. Based on that input, the Chairman, Search-cum-Selection
Committee rejected the candidature of the petitioner. Further, in any event,
since there were some complaints alleging that the second vacancy of Technical
Member (Trade Marks) had not been advertised properly, it was decided to issue
a fresh advertisement for the same. The petitioner, along with other aspiring
candidates, would be entitled to participate in W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 17
of 24 such process. Accordingly, the post was re-advertised on 16.04.2011 and
again recently on 28.07.2012 for Technical Member (Trademarks).
33\. I have heard ld. Counsel for the parties.
34\. During arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner has produced Office
Memorandum dated 17.07.2012, issued by Ministry of Personnel, Public
Grievances & Pensions, Department of Personnel & Training regarding setting up

35\. The petitioner has filed a compilation of the cases in which he has
appeared, which shows that the petitioner has substantial experience in the
Trademarks matters. Moreover, the petitioner apart from an enrolled Advocate
and having practice of around more than 20 W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 18 of 24
years, he is pursuing final year of LLM (IPR), pursuing second Semester in
M.S. Cyber Security and Cyber law and completed DL- 001 Intellectual Property
Primer Course, DL-101 General Course on Intellectual Property, Patent
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and Online Distant Learning Course. Recently, he has
completed Advance Course DL-317, Arbitration and Mediation Procedure under the
WIPO Rules. He also admitted for an Advance Course DL-450 Intellectual
Property Management.
36\. He has been filing application for registration of Trademarks,
Copyrights, Design applications and has been dealing with respective
offices/registries as well as filing criminal and dealing with civil suits of
injunction for infringement of trademarks which can be established from the
compilation of the cases he has filed before this Court.
37\. The petitioner applied for Technical Member (Trademark). There has been
history of this post. To fill up this vacancy, an advertisement was issued on
27.02.2010. Pursuance thereof, 8 applications were received, out of which
three candidates were shortlisted. After interviewing the candidates on
03.09.2010 by the Search-cum-Selection Committee, none of the three candidates
was considered fit for appointment to the said post.
38\. Again an advertisement was issued on 04.09.2010. After the meeting of
Search-cum-Selection Committee on 13.09.2010 when no candidate was found
suitable for selection as Technical Member (Trademark), the Committee
recommended that this post could not be W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 19 of 24
re-advertised (as already an advertisement was given in the Newspaper on
04.09.2010 for filling up one post of Technical Member) and both the posts of
Technical Member may, therefore, be considered for filling up from amongst the
candidates who would apply against the advertisement given on 04.09.2010.
Accordingly a Corrigendum Addendum in the advertisement was carried out on
30.10.2010 that number of posts will be two for Technical Member (Trademarks)
and one for Technical Member (Patents).
39\. In response thereto, as mentioned above, 8 applications were received for
selection of Technical Member (Trademarks), out of which seven were Advocates
including the petitioner and one Senior Joint Registrar of Trademarks.
40\. The petitioner was called for interview before Search-cum- Selection
Committee. After scrutinizing the applications / documents, the said Committee
recommended the Sh. V. Ravi and Sh. Sanjiv Kr. Chaswal (petitioner herein)
(subject to verification of his experience in Trademarks for Technical Member
(Trademarks).
41\. For verification of the experience of the petitioner, Ms. S. Usha, Vice
Chairman, IPAB, who was one of the members of the Search- cum-Selection
Committee, was requested to do needful, who after perusing the documents has
opined that the petitioner was not qualified for appointment as Technical
Member as per the Provision of Section 85 (4) (b) of the Trademarks Act, 1999.
42\. The question before this Court is that if the Candidate has been W.P (C)
No. 6299/2011 Page 20 of 24 selected by Search-cum-Selection Committee, can
the same Committee has power to reject the candidature on any ground.
43\. As per the opinion given by Ms. S. Usha, Vice-Chairman, IPAB, the
petitioner has not produced any order to say that he had appeared before
Registrar of Trademarks in any opposition proceedings. That apart, the
candidate has produced about 3 judgments to say that he has appeared before
the High Court of Delhi, even in those judgments, she did not find his
appearance as he had only assisted the Counsel. Therefore, it does not prove
his experience. Further, it is pointed out that the petitioner‟s name does not
appear in Panda case.
44\. But the fact remains that Ms. S. Usha, Vice-Chairman, IPAB did not verity
about the experience from Anup Singh and Co. nor verified the list of cases
pending or otherwise in High Court or District Court submitted by the
petitioner as she has opined that no opposition case has been filed.
45\. On this, I am of the considered opinion that if the petitioner has been
able to get the maximum of his applications registered, except few, that does
not mean that he has no experience in this field. Moreover, the petitioner
appeared in the interview and after proper assessment about the documents and
the knowledge of law in the Trade Marks, the Search-cum-Selection Committee
selected the petitioner. However, based on the input submitted by Ms. S. Usha,
Vice- Chairman, IPAB the candidature of the petitioner was rejected. There
were 7 Advocates, out of those only the petitioner was found suitable.
W.P (C) No. 6299/2011 Page 21 of 24
Therefore, he was selected for the post in question.
46\. It is also emerged on record that there have been some complaints on the
second vacancy of Technical Member (Trade Marks) as had not been advertised
properly. Therefore, Ms. S. Usha, Vice- Chairman of the Committee has taken
easy decision by rejecting the candidature of the petitioner.
47\. The exercise of the Selection Committee is not a mere formality and
cannot be a conditional one. If the Committee is of the view that any of the
Candidates is not worthy of then the said Committee has every right to reject
him or her straightway. No-one can question to the decision of the said
Committee, however, once a decision is taken, that cannot be a subjective as
happened in the present case. If the Selection Committee was of the different
view, then the petitioner should have been given a chance to put his case
before taking final decision.
48\. Interview is meant to assess the knowledge, personality and calibre of a
candidate. The petitioner has gone through the same and thereafter, he was
selected by the Committee.
49\. In such eventuality, the case of the petitioner should have been referred
to the ACC, which is the appointing authority and if the ACC found any wrong
with the candidate, it has the power to reject the candidature of a candidate.
50\. In past also, there have been instances of scrapping of panel by W.P (C)
No. 6299/2011 Page 22 of 24 various Ministries / Departments without the
approval of ACC. Therefore, the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and
Pensions (DOPT) issued Office Memorandum dated 17.07.2012 as mentioned above
and clearly sent message to all the Ministries that the panel recommended by a
Committee would be accepted in toto by the Ministry / Department. Any
deviation in such matters will require the prior approval of ACC.
51\. By the aforesaid Office Memorandum, it is further stated that such type
of practice is not an healthy tactics therefore all the Ministries /
Departments were requested to follow the laid down norms without deviation and
that the power rested with the ACC should not be exercised by anyone without
the approval of ACC.
52\. The case of the petitioner was also not sent before the ACC. The
Selection Committee first selected the petitioner thereafter itself rejected
the same.
53\. In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the
Selection Committee was not the competent authority to take such decision
against the petitioner. Consequently, the opinion given by Ms. S. Usha, Vice
Chairman, IPAB vide D.O.Dy. No.9369/2010 and subsequent action taken is set
aside. I hereby direct the concerned Ministry that the case of the petitioner
be put up before the ACC. Thereafter, the said authority shall take decision
on the fate of the petitioner.
54\. In view of the above, instant petition stands disposed of with no W.P (C)
No. 6299/2011 Page 23 of 24 order as to costs.
CM Nos.9848/2010 (for stay), 12662/2011 (for stay) & 246/2012 (for directions)
With the disposal of the petition itself, all these applications have become
infructuous. Therefore, the same are disposed of accordingly.

2\. In brief, the facts of the case are that Department of Industrial Policy
and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, on behalf of IPAB published
