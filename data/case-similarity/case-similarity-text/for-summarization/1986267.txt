JUDGMENT Bhaskar Bhattacharya, J.
1\. By this writ application, the writ petitioner has prayed for quashing of
FIR registered on June 14, 1999 and the consequential investigation in CBI/
SPE/ ACB/Calcutta Case No. RC 18/99 under Sections 120B/420/468/471/ 477A of
the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
2\. The facts giving rise to the filing of the instant writ application may be
summarised thus :
a) The petitioner was entrusted by the Eastern Railways to do various works as
per diverse contracts sometimes in the year 1986. Ultimately, disputes arose
as to the amount payable to the petitioner by virtue of those contracts and
consequently the differences were referred to arbitration in terms of
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. By an order dated May 8, 1998 the then
Hon'ble Chief Justice appointed Justice Anil Kumar Sen, a retired Chief
Justice of this Court, as the sole Arbitrator in respect of all the 26
applied only in a case where those facts are established on conclusion of
trial; but taking aid of such principle, an accused person at the stage of
investigation by filing a writ application cannot demand scrutiny of those
disputed facts for the purpose of establishing that such investigation has
been vitiated by the presence of those vicious elements.
54\. The decisions cited by Mr. Mukherjee are, thus, of no assistance to his
client.
55\. I, thus, find that the petitioner has failed to make out a case of
quashing of the FIR and the consequent investigation in this application under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
56\. The writ application is, thus, dismissed. Interim order granted earlier
stands vacated. The respondents are directed to proceed further in accordance
with law.
57\. The xerox copies of the documents produced by the CBJ be kept with the
safe custody in sealed cover till the expiry of the period of limitation for
preferring an appeal against this order. If no appeal is preferred, those
Justice of this Court, as the sole Arbitrator in respect of all the 26
applications filed by the petitioner.
b) On August 31, 1998, the learned Arbitrator allowed the claims of the
petitioner in full and passed awards amounting to Rs. 32,83,36,357/-including
interest.
c) Thereafter, on December 10, 1998 the Railway Authority filed 26
applications under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
for setting aside those 26 awards. In course of hearing of such applications
under Section 34 of the Act, the Railway Authorities for the first time
alleged that no contract was executed between the parties and that the
petitioner did not execute any work whatsoever and that the petitioner had
committed forgery and was guilty of fabricating documents. It was further
alleged that the petitioner influenced some of the officials of the railways
and in collusion and conspiracy with them procured the award.
d) Subsequently on the complaint of the Railway Administration, the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case being No. R.C. 18 of 1999
dated June 14, 1999 against the petitioner and some railway employees. The sum
and substance of the complaint is that on verification of the signatures in
the tender papers, it was found that the signatures, other than those of two
officers, were not genuine and that one of them was not available in the
station and was attending a foreign training in U.K. It was further alleged
that seals and stamps available with the letters of the contractor said to be
deposited with the Railway Authority are not genuine because such type of seal
or stamp was not used by the Railway Receipt Section of the concerned offices.
e) It is further alleged that the source of Ballast supply to railway was not
capable to undertake delivery of such huge quantity within a short period of
3/4 months. It was further asserted that signature of one of the P.W. It was
fake and that of two others were found to be visually fake.
3\. By this writ application, the writ petitioner has prayed for quashing of
the aforesaid FIR mainly on the ground that before lodging such complaint on
24th May, 1999, which was registered on 14th June, 1999, the Railway Authority
earlier lodged two other complaints before the CBI, one in the month of
October, 1998 and other in the month of March, 1999 but the CBI after
investigation having found no merit in those complaints, did not proceed any
further. According to the petitioner the sole object of the respondents is to
get rid of 26 awards given against the Railway Authorities. It is pointed out
that a learned Single Judge of this Court has rejected all the applications
filed under Section 34 of the Act and against those decisions, 26 appeals are
pending before the Division Bench of this Court.
4\. It is further emphasized that it appears from the record that the Railway
Authority requested the CBI to prepare a preliminary report against the
petitioner to impress upon the Division Bench of this Court that those awards
were passed on the basis of procured evidence so that the awards are set
aside. The petitioner, thus, prays for quashing the FIR not only on the ground
of malevolence but also on the ground that earlier two complaints having
already been lodged, no investigation can continue on the basis of the FIR
registered on June 14, 1999 which is the third complaint.
5\. The Railway Administration although has been added as respondent and
contesting the proceedings has not come forward with any affidavit-in-
opposition but this writ application is opposed by CBI by filing affidavit-in-
opposition. In the affidavit-in-opposition, the CBI has even though disputed
the allegations contained in the writ application but the specific allegations
made in paragraph 56 of the writ application that investigation had started on
the basis of third complaint has not been specifically dealt with by the CBI
Authority.
6\. Mr. Saktinath Mukherjee, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the petitioner strenuously contended that the investigation proceeded on the
basis of third complaint should be quashed. He has further contended that as
it appears from the materials on record, there was prior discussions between
the complainant viz. Railway Administration and the investigating agency viz.
CBI as would appear from the letter dated March 23, 1999 written by CBI
referred to in the complaint dated May 24, 1999 and such being the position,
this Court should immediately quash the entire proceedings being a travesty of
justice.
7\. Mr. Mukherjee further contends that by Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 specific jurisdiction having been conferred upon the
Court to adjudicate whether by practising fraud any award has been obtained
and in spite of such plea, a learned Single Judge of this Court having turned
down such prayer and maintained the awards, there is no scope of further
criminal investigation on the self-same issue. Mr. Mukherjee, in this
connection, submits that a finding on such a question in proceedings under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was arrived at by the
Court and a learned Single Judge having already found that no case of fraud
has been proved, a fresh criminal investigation cannot be initiated at this
stage on the identical issue. Mr. Mukherjee points out that even in civil
proceeding the party alleging fraud must establish the existence of such fraud
beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, Mr. Mukherjee continues, if no fraud is
established in the civil proceedings beyond reasonable doubt, it will be an
abuse of process of law to permit continuation of criminal investigation to
prove the self-same fact over again with same standard of proof. In support of
all such contentions, Mr. Mukherjee principally relies upon the following
decisions of the Supreme Court:
1\. T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala and Ors., .
2\. State of Haryana and Ors. v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors., .
3\. S. N. Sharma v. Bipin Kumar Tewari and Ors., .
4\. State of Bihar and Anr. v. J.A.C. Saldhana and Ors., .
5\. State of A.P. v. Punati Ramulu and Ors., (1994) Suppl. (1) SCC 590.
6\. K. M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra, .
7\. Ajay Mitra v. State of M.P. .
8\. Chandra Pal Singh and Ors. v. Maharaj Singh and Anr., .
9\. Ishwar Singh v. State of U.P., .
8\. Mr. Ranjan Roy, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the CBI, has
vehemently opposed all the aforesaid contentions of Mr. Mukherjee. As regards
the allegation of the petitioner that the present investigation has been
initiated on the basis of the third compliant after submission of previous
two, Mr. Roy contends that it is now settled position of law that even if it
is established that investigation has commenced on the basis of second or
third complaint, that fact alone cannot be a ground for quashing of FIR. In
support of such contention Mr. Roy placed reliance upon the following
decisions of the Supreme Court :
1\. M. Krishna v. State of Karnataka, .
2\. Superintendent of Police, CBI and Ors. v. Tapan Kumar Singh, .
3\. Kari Choudhary v. Sita Devi and Ors., 2000(2) SCC (Cri.) 269.
9\. Regarding the delay in sending the copy of FIR to the Magistrate, Mr. Roy
contends that such delay does not render the entire prosecution of the case
doubtful nor can such fact enable this Court to quash the entire prosecution.
Mr. Roy contends if there is delay in sending the copy that fact would put the
Court on guard and the delay must be reasonably explained at the time of
trial. In case of non-explanation of delay, Mr. Roy contends, Court should be
cautious and is under obligation to examine the prosecution version minutely
to ensure that there was no false implication of innocent person. In support
of such contention, Mr. Roy relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Bijoy Singh and Anr. v. State of Bihar, reported in 2000(3) SCC
(Cri.) 1093.
10\. As regards the prayer of quashing of the FIR, Mr. Roy contends that an
FIR can be quashed only if it is established such FIR does not disclose any
offence. Once it is established that the FIR, if found to be true, constitutes
an offence, the Court cannot quash that FIR at investigation stage. As regards
the allegation of mala fide intention, Mr. Roy contends that once the FIR
discloses an offence punishable under law, the plea of malice cannot be
scrutinized at investigation stage. Mr. Roy contends that if the contention of
Mr. Mukherjee that in case of allegation of mala fide intention, the Court
should examine such allegation before actual trial is accepted, there will be
one round of pretrial of the offence alleged and in the process, the
prosecution will be compelled to disclose materials beforehand thereby giving
an opportunity to the accused to tamper with the evidence or to manufacture
suitable defence. According to Mr. Roy the latest trend of the Supreme Court
decisions show that at the investigation stage a prosecution can be quashed
only if it is established that the FIR does not disclose any offence. Mr. Roy
contends that in this case, these is no dispute that in FIR serious
allegations have been made on fraud and collusion and consequently, the
petitioner has illegally gained huge amount of money. He further submits that
it has come in evidence during investigation that the petitioner has produced
forged documents and the signature of the railway officials appearing on the
documents are also forged. Therefore, in such a situation, there is no scope
of quashing the investigation. Mr. Roy points out that the prosecution has
already prepared chargesheet but the same could not be filed in view of
interim order granted in this case. Mr. Roy further contends that once
investigation is completed, even if there is defect in FIR, that loses its
importance and, thus, his client should be permitted to file the chargesheet
and the petitioner should take part in criminal trial where he will be
entitled to agitate all the points taken in writ application in defence, but
there is no reason why the petitioner should not face the trial.
11\. As regards other question of pendency of civil dispute and the finding
recorded by the learned Single Judge upholding the awards, Mr. Roy submits
that it is now settled position of law that even if there is pending civil
litigation that fact cannot come in the way of the simultaneous proceeding in
Criminal Court. In support of such contentions Mr. Roy places reliance upon
the following decisions :
1\. Trisuns Chemicals Industry v. Rajesh Agarwal and Ors., .
2\. Kamala Devi Agarwal v. State of West Bengal and Ors., .
3\. MEDCHL Chemicals & Pharma (P) Ltd. v. Biological E. Ltd. and Ors., .
12\. Lastly, Mr. Roy contends that the question of the alleged evil intention
cannot be decided in this writ application on the basis of affidavit. If the
petitioner alleges improper motive, it is for the petitioner to prove such
fact and such fact should be adjudicated at the time of criminal trial. He
reiterates that there cannot be a pre-trial of such issue on the basis of
affidavits and documents at the instance of parties thereby causing
unnecessary delay in the criminal trial. Mr. Roy, in this connection, places
strong reliance upon the observation of the Supreme Court in the case of State
of Bihar and Ors. v. P.P. Sharma, reported in 1992 (Suppl.)1 SCC 222, Mr. Roy,
thus, prays for dismissal of the writ application.
13\. Mr. Kapoor, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Railway, has
adopted the submission of Mr. Roy and has supplemented such argument by
relying upon the following decisions :
1\. Lalmuni Devi v. State of Bihar and Ors., .
2\. M. Krishnan v. Vijay Shing and Anr., .
3\. Assistant Collector of Customs, Bombay and Anr. v. L. R. Melwani and Anr.,
.
14\. The sum and substance of contentions of Mr. Kapoor is that once, it is
established that the FIR discloses an offence, there is no scope of
investigation by a Writ Court before the actual trial for ascertaining whether
such allegation is trained with malice. Merely because a civil dispute is
already pending over the self-same matter, Mr. Kapoor contends, that cannot be
a ground for quashing of the criminal proceeding at investigation stage.
Quashing of the criminal proceeding at investigation stage, according to Mr.
Kapoor, should be made in rarest of the rare cases where the allegation either
does not disclose any offence or is so improbable that no reasonable person
would consider the allegations contained in the FIR to be true. Mr. Kapoor,
thus, prays for dismissal of the writ application with costs.
15\. After the conclusion of the submissions of the learned Counsel for the
respondents, Mr. Mukherjee, before giving reply, prayed before the Court for a
direction upon the CBI to produce the complaint register maintained at the
relevant office for the period between 22nd October, 1998 and 31st March, 1999
and also the letter dated March 23, 1999 written by the CBI which is referred
to in the complaint dated May 24, 1999.
16\. Mr. Mukherjee asseverated that if the said register is produced it would
appear that the previous two complaints were entertained and that the CBI
found no merit in those complaints as would appear from the remarks noted in
the said register. Mr. Mukherjee further submitted that the letter dated March
23, 1999 would conclusively prove connivance between Railway Authority and CBI
for initiation of fresh investigation on the basis of procured materials.
17\. In view of such submission, this Court directed the learned Advocate for
the CBI to produce those documents in Court. Pursuant to such direction, Mr.
Roy the learned Counsel for the CBI produced those documents in original as
also the xerox copies thereof with a prayer for return of originals after
comparing those with the xerox copies. Mr. Roy, however, submitted that those
documents were produced for inspection of the Court only but the petitioner
should not be permitted to inspect those documents. Mr. Roy contended that in
the register the relevant entries from October, 1998 till June 14, 1999 and
the notes of progress of investigation of the cases including the present
prosecution having been recorded, the petitioner at this stage is not entitled
to inspect those reports. Similarly, Mr. Roy continued, the letter dated March
23, 1999 having been seized from the complainant pursuant to the complaint
dated May 24, 1999, his client is entitled to the benefit of Section 172 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. Mr. Roy, thus, objects to the demand of
inspection of those documents by the petitioner.
18\. Mr. Mukherjee, for the petitioner, has, however, opposed the aforesaid
contention of Mr. Roy. According to Mr. Mukherjee, once a Writ Court passes a
direction for production of a document, unless the party upon whom such
direction has been given, by affidavit claims privilege in terms of the
provisions contained in the Indian Evidence Act and convinces the Court that
he is entitled to such protection, the other party is entitled to inspect
those documents; otherwise, Mr. Mukherjee proceeds, the Court should not look
into those documents even if produced for inspection of the Court and it
should be presumed that the party has not complied with the direction of the
Court for production of records. Mr. Mukherjee submits that the documents
called for by Court in this case are neither unpublished official record
relating to affairs of the State nor will the interest of the public suffer if
those documents are inspected by his client so as to justify refusal of
inspection. Mr. Mukherjee in this connection placed strong reliance upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ghaio Mal & Sons v. State of
Delhi and Ors., and that of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of
Mrinal Kanti Das Burman v. State of West Bengal, reported in 1976(1) CLJ 571.
19\. Mr. Mukherjee further contends that the letter dated March 23, 1999
having been written by the CBI prior to lodging of the FIR cannot form part of
"police diaries" within the meaning of Section 172 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and thus, the CBI cannot get the benefit of the said provision of
the Code. At the conclusion of hearing, the petitioner also filed a formal
application praying for inspection of those documents.
20\. Before I proceed to enter into the merit of this writ application, I
propose to deal with the question whether the petitioner is entitled to have
inspection of the documents produced by the CBI.
21\. After hearing the learned Counsel for the parties, I am of the opinion
that generally parties to the proceedings are entitled to get inspection of
the documents produced before Court by any of the parties as per direction of
the Court. But to this general rule there are exceptions. If the nature of the
documents is such that law gives privileges to the party producing those
documents to claim that those should not be made known to the public or the
other party, in such a case, the Writ Court can refuse inspection to the other
party. Sections 124 and 123 of the Evidence Act point out the circumstances
where the direction of production of documents can be resisted by a party
asked to produce documents. Similarly Section 172 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure enumerates the materials which the prosecution can refuse to
disclose to the accused. A Court cannot make use of the police diaries in its
judgment or in seeking confirmation of its opinion on question of appreciation
of evidence from, the statements contained in those diaries. The only proper
use a Court can make of those materials is that during the trial it can get
assistance from those by suggesting means of further elucidating points which
need clearing up and which may be material for doing justice between the State
and the accused. (See Habeeb v. State of Hyderabad, reported in)
22\. In the present case, the letter dated March 23, 1999 although written by
the CBI to the Railways prior to lodging FIR having been again seized from the
complaint by the Investigating Officer pursuant to filing of FIR, clearly
comes within the purview of Section 172 of the Code. The said letter
definitely forms part of the expression "a statement of circumstances
ascertained through his investigation" appearing in Section 172 of the Code.
At this stage, this Court will accept the contention of the CBI that the said
letter was seized from the complainant pursuant to the FIR to be true. Such
contention is however, subject to proof in the criminal trial.
23\. As regards the register maintained by the CBI from October, 1998 till
March 1999, the CBI can legitimately contend that they have right to maintain
secrecy of other complaints lodged before them and also the progress of
investigation noted therein although the petitioner is not party to those
investigations.
24\. I, therefore, hold that the petitioner is not entitled to get inspection
of the documents produced by the CBI at this stage [See in this connection the
observations of Apex Court in Director, CBI and Ors. v. Niyamavedi, reported
in 1995 SCC (Cri.) 558]. CAN No. 712 of 2004 is, thus, disposed of
accordingly.
25\. I now propose to enter into the merit of this writ application.
26\. The petitioner has prayed for quashing of the FIR and the consequent
investigation at the preliminary stage on twofold grounds.
27\. First, the initiation of the proceedings was actuated with a mala fide
intention and secondly, the investigation started on the basis of third
complaint was void when no action had been taken on the basis of the first two
complaints.
28\. As regards the first ground, we must bear in mind that the question
whether a prosecution has been started with mala fide intention can only be
answered after investigation of facts. In a given case, such intention may be
conspicuous on the face of record but in some other cases it may not be
apparent but can be detected on scrutiny of evidence; similarly, in some cases
although mala fide intention may be ostensible at the first sight but on
appreciation of evidence it may be found in the long run that what was
apparent was not the reality but was merely an apprehension or a false plea
taken with a motive to prejudice the Court.
29\. This Court at the same time cannot lose sight of the fact that an
investigation and the consequent trial, if any, of an alleged crime must be
conducted in accordance with the provisions contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure. According to the Code, if the Court takes cognizance of the
offence, it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused has committed the alleged offences. The accused at the trial is free
to lead evidence in support of his plea of innocence and even may decide not
to lead any evidence and can only cross-examine the prosecution witnesses for
the purpose of pointing out the mendacity of the evidence offered on behalf of
the prosecution. The plea that the initiation of prosecution is the outcome of
"malice" against the accused is also available to him at that stage. But the
law does not permit the petitioner to approach a Writ Court claiming separate
adjudication on the question of "mala fide intention" at the stage of
investigation.
30\. It is now settled position of law that a person can move a High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution complaining violation of his fundamental
right or other statutory rights. If in course of investigation, there is
violation of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he can approach
a Writ Court and in appropriate cases, the Writ Court can give him relief. But
a person against whom an investigation has commenced cannot claim deviation
from the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the plea of mala fide
intention of the complainant or the prosecutor. A petitioner can definitely
come up before a Writ Court alleging that the FIR does not disclose any
offence at all and that the investigation on the basis of such an FIR should
be quashed. He may also be successful in quashing an FIR if the allegations
contained therein although constitute an offence, are so improbable that no
reasonable individual will believe such statement. But if the FIR, taken to be
true, constitutes an offence, he cannot ask a Writ Court for an adjudication
beforehand on the question whether such FIR was lodged with evil intention.
31\. I, thus, find no merit on the first ground and do not propose to
investigate the ground of "sinister motive" alleged in this writ application.
32\. The next question is whether an investigation started on the basis of
third complaint can be quashed merely because in the past two similar
complaints were lodged but the police did not register those complaints as FIR
nor did it send those to the Court as required under Section 155 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure.
33\. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the case of Kari Choudhary v. Sita
Devi, 2002(2) SCC (Cri.) 269, the ultimate object of every investigation is to
find out whether the offences alleged have been committed and if so, who have
committed those. Even otherwise, the Supreme Court proceeded, the
investigation agency is not precluded from further investigation in respect of
an offence in spite of forwarding a report under Section 173(2) on a previous
occasion. In the present case, if no action was taken on the basis of earlier
complaints, it is for the prosecution to explain the reason for such inaction
at the time of trial, if such point is raised. But at this stage, there is no
scope of calling for explanation for such alleged inaction in this, writ
jurisdiction. Thus, even if it appears that prior to formal lodging of FIR on
June 14, 1999 there were two earlier complaints making similar allegations,
such fact alone cannot justify quashing of the FIR at this stage.
34\. In a given case, whether investigation commenced on the basis of a
particular complaint, is always a question of fact. In this case whether the
CBI started investigation on the basis of complaint filed in October, 1998 is
a question of fact, to be adjudicated at the trial. If it is established that
investigation really started on the basis of the complaint filed in October,
1998, then the 2nd and 3rd complaints will fall within the compass of Section
161 of the Code and the rigour of Section 162 will come into play. All these
points will be available to the petitioner at the time of trial conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Code. But at this stage, there is no
scope of scrutiny of those disputed questions of fact beforehand in this writ
application in departure from the procedure provided in the Code.
35\. The other submission of Mr. Mukherjee that the question of fraud being
the subject-matter of the pending appeals under the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, the criminal investigation on the self-same issue
should not continue, is equally devoid of any substance. Even if it is
ultimately held in those proceedings that there was no fraud in obtaining the
impugned awards, such fact cannot stand in the way of criminal investigation
at the instance of the CBI who is not party to the arbitration proceedings.
The Apex Court has already settled the aforesaid position of law in various
judgments referred to by Mr. Roy and Mr. Kapoor [See Lalmuni Devi v. State of
Bihar and M. Krishnan v. Vijay Singh and Ors. (supra)].
36\. I will now proceed to consider the decisions relied upon by Mr.
Mukherjee.
37\. In the case T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala and Ors. the Supreme Court was
considering cases where in spite of the fact that investigations pursuant to
registration of an FIR lodged in 1994 was pending, fresh FIR was lodged in
1997 over the self-same incident indicting additional persons with graver
charges after the change of Government on the basis of report of commission
under Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. Under such circumstances, the Supreme
Court was of the view that on the date of filing of the 2nd FIR, the
investigations in the earlier proceedings being pending, the correct course of
action should have been to take note of the findings and contents of the
report of commission, streamline the investigation to ascertain the true
facts, collect the evidence in support thereof, form an opinion under Sections
169 and 170 of Cr.P.C., as the case may be, and forward the report or reports
under Section 173(2) or Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C. to the Magistrate
concerned instead of registration of second FIR with regard to the same
incident and making fresh investigation. Thus, the 2nd FIR and fresh
investigation were quashed leaving it open to the investigating agency to seek
permission of the Magistrate concerned in the earlier case to make further
investigation and forward further report or reports.
38\. In my view, the principles laid down in the case of T. T. Antony (supra)
cannot have any application to the case before us where even according to the
petitioner the earlier complaints were not at all registered as FIR and the
investigations in this case are proceeding on the basis of the 3rd complaint
which is "first registered FIR". Thus, there is no scope of quashing such FIR
and the consequent investigations at this stage, simply because the two
earlier complaints were not registered as FIR by relying upon the decision in
the case of T. T. Antony (supra).
39\. In the case of State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors., , the Supreme
Court was considering an appeal by special leave against the judgment of a
Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana quashing the entire
criminal proceedings inclusive of registration of information report against
Ch. Bhajan Lal in a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India. The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court quashing the
First Information Report; however, the Supreme Court also quashed the
commencement as well as entire investigation on the ground that the third
appellant therein was not clothed with legal authority to take up
investigation with the meaning of Section 5A(1) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act after giving liberty to State Government to direct
investigation afresh, if it so desired, through a competent police officer
empowered under Section 5A(1) of the Act. In paragraph 108 of the judgment,
the Apex Court enumerated seven different circumstances when a Writ Court can
quash the criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process of law or to
otherwise secure the ends of justice. The Court, however, hastened to add that
it was not possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently
channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae or to give an
exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be
exercised.
40\. Mr. Mukherjee asserted with vigour that this case comes within the
seventh clause mentioned in paragraph 108. The said clause is quoted below :
"Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or
where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for
wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private
or personal grudge."
41\. At this stage, it will be pertinent to mention that in the said case
although allegations of the nature mentioned in the seventh clause quoted
above were made, the Supreme Court refused to quash the proceedings on that
ground and in paragraph 109 made the following observations :
"We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a
criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection
and that too in the rarest of rare cases; that the Court will not be justified
in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise
of the allegations made in FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act
according to its whim and caprice."
42\. Further, in paragraph 114, the Supreme Court quoted with approval the
following observations of Bhagawati C.J, in Sheonandan Paswan v. State of
Bihar, :
"It is a well established proposition of law that a criminal prosecution, if
otherwise justifiable and based upon adequate evidence, does not become
vitiated on account of mala fide or political vendetta of the first
information or the complainant."
43\. In my view, the principles laid down in case of State of Haryana (supra),
if are applied to the facts of the present case, this writ application should
be dismissed, because at this stage of investigation, I should not be
justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to reliability or genuineness or
otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR that the petitioner used forged
signatures of the railway officials or fake seal or stamp or that it was not
possible to undertake delivery of such huge materials within a short period of
3/4 months.
44\. Those allegations should be decided on the evidence of the parties and
that of handwriting experts. This Court, at the stage of investigation, cannot
probe into those disputed questions of fact. This is not a case that the
allegations are so absurd that no reasonable or prudent man will believe those
imputations. I, thus, find that the case of State of Haryana (supra) rather
goes against the petitioner.
45\. In the case of S. N. Sharma v. Bipin Kumar Tewari and Ors., , an FIR was
lodged implicating Sri S. N. Sharma, an Additional District Magistrate
(Judicial). Sri Sharma, filed application before the Judicial Magistrate
having jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence alleging that a false
report had been lodged against him at the connivance of the local police
thereby praying for conducting a preliminary enquiry by the Court itself by
invoking Section 159 of the Cr.P.C. (1898). The learned Magistrate allowed
such prayer directing the police to stop investigation. Against such order,
High Court was moved under Section 561A of the then Code on the ground that
the learned Magistrate acted without jurisdiction. The High Court allowed the
application, quashed the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate and directed
the police to conclude investigation and submit report to the learned Judicial
Magistrate in accordance with law. The Supreme Court upheld the order of the
High Court. At the time of hearing before Supreme Court, it was contended that
the interpretation of Section 159 by High Court would prejudice the judicial
officers who had to deal with cases brought up by the police and to give
decisions unfavourable to the police. It was submitted that the police might
engineer false report of cognizable offence against judicial officers and then
harass them by carrying on a prolonged investigation of the offence made out
by the report. In answer to such contention, the Supreme Court pointed out
that though the Code of Criminal Procedure gives to the police unfettered
power to investigate all cases where they suspect that a cognizable offence
has been committed, in appropriate cases, an aggrieved person can always seek
remedy by invoking power, of the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution under which if the High Court could be convinced that the power
of investigation had been exercised by a police officer mala fide, the High
Court can always issue a writ of mandamus restraining the police officer from
misusing his legal power. In that case, the Supreme Court however did not
interfere.
46\. The position of law that if the High Court is convinced that the power of
investigation has been improperly exercised by the police officer, it can
always issue appropriate order preventing misuse of such power, is well
settled. But the law is equally established that merely because such
allegation has been made, the Court should not enter into those questions if
those are of a disputed nature requiring detailed investigation of facts.
Improper investigation based on malice should be so much manifested that there
should be no doubt that the proceedings should not be allowed to continue any
further; otherwise, it would be an abuse of process of law. In the present
case, the petitioner has not been able to make out such a case at this stage
so as to nip the proceedings in bud. I make no further comment, lest, the case
of the petitioner is prejudiced at the trial.
47\. In the case of State of Bihar and Anr. v. J.A.C. Shaldhana and Ors.
(supra) the Supreme Court in clear terms indicated that the High Court in that
case committed a grave error by making observations on seriously disputed
question of facts taking its cue from affidavits which in such a situation
would hardly provide any reliable material and investigation into mala fides
at that stage was not called for.
48\. I fail to understand how that decision can be of any help to Mr.
Mukherjee's client.
49\. In the case of K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra (supra) the Supreme
Court while dealing with an appeal against an order of conviction pointed out
in paragraph 26 that the question whether the investigation commenced or not
is a question of fact and the same does not depend upon the, irregularity
committed in the matter of recording FIR by the concerned police officer. I
have already held that the question whether the registered FIR in this case
will be hit by Section 162 of the Code being a disputed question of fact
should not be adjudicated in this writ application and that such point will be
open to the petitioner at the time of trial.
50\. Ajay Mitra v. State of M.P. (supra) is a case where the High Court did
not quash an FIR relating to an offence under Section 420 of the Indian Penal
Code in exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. notwithstanding the
fact that the allegations made in the complaint, even if those are taken on
the face value and accepted in its entirety did not constitute offence and as
such the Supreme Court reversed the decision and quashed the FIR. In the case
before us, it is not the case of the petitioner that the FIR, even if
believed, did not constitute any offence. Thus, the principles laid down in
the case of Ajay Mitra (supra) cannot have any application to the facts of the
present case.
51\. In the case of Chandra Pal Singh and Ors. v. Maharaj Singh and Ors.,
(supra) a frustrated landlord lodged complaint before the Magistrate for
taking action under Sections 193, 199 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code on the
allegation that the tenant affirmed false affidavit before the Rent
Controller. The tenant filed application under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for
quashing the complaint. The High Court having refused the prayer, the tenant
went before Supreme Court. While dealing with such a case, the Supreme Court
held that the averments in the complaint did not constitute any offence under
Sections 199 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code and as such, was liable to be
quashed. So far the offence under Section 193 is concerned, the complaint not
having been referred to by the Rent Controller before whom the alleged false
affidavit was filed, such complaint was not entertainable by the learned
Judicial Magistrate. Thus, the entire complaint was quashed. In the present
case, it is not the allegation of the petitioner that the averments in the
complaint did not constitute the offence nor is it the case that the complaint
has not otherwise complied with any other mandatory requirements of law. Thus,
the said decision is of no avail to the petitioner.
52\. Ishwar Singh v. State of U.P., , is a case where while hearing an appeal
against conviction on the charge of murder, the Supreme Court reiterated the
well settled principle that extraordinary delay in sending the FIR is a
circumstance which provides legitimate basis for suspecting that the First
Information Report was recorded much later than the stated date and hour
affording sufficient time to the prosecution to introduce improvements and
embellishment and set up a distorted version of the occurrence when no
explanation is offered for this extraordinary delay in sending the report to
the Magistrate. In my opinion, the said principle can be applied after
evidence is laid by prosecution, but for mere delay in sending the report to
the Magistrate the FIR cannot be quashed at the stage of investigation. [See
State of Punjab v. Dharam Vir Singh Jethi, 1994 SCC (Cri.) 500].
53\. In the case of State of A.P. v. Punati Ramulu and Ors., 1994 Supp(1) SCC
590, the Supreme Court while hearing an appeal against acquittal in a murder
case observed that in a case where the police officer deliberately did not
record FIR on receipt of information about cognizable offence and subsequently
FIR was prepared after reaching the spot, and after due deliberations,
consultation and discussions, such a complaint cannot be treated as FIR and
that it would be considered as statement made during investigation of a ease
and would be hit by Section 162 of Cr.P.C. and consequently it would be unsafe
to rely on such tainted investigation. In my view, the said principle can be
applied only in a case where those facts are established on conclusion of
trial; but taking aid of such principle, an accused person at the stage of
investigation by filing a writ application cannot demand scrutiny of those
disputed facts for the purpose of establishing that such investigation has
been vitiated by the presence of those vicious elements.
54\. The decisions cited by Mr. Mukherjee are, thus, of no assistance to his
client.
55\. I, thus, find that the petitioner has failed to make out a case of
quashing of the FIR and the consequent investigation in this application under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
56\. The writ application is, thus, dismissed. Interim order granted earlier
stands vacated. The respondents are directed to proceed further in accordance
with law.
57\. The xerox copies of the documents produced by the CBJ be kept with the
safe custody in sealed cover till the expiry of the period of limitation for
preferring an appeal against this order. If no appeal is preferred, those
should be returned to the CBI. If appeal is preferred, those will kept in such
custody subject to the direction of the Appeal Court.
58\. In the facts and circumstances, there will be, however, no order as to
costs.

b) On August 31, 1998, the learned Arbitrator allowed the claims of the
petitioner in full and passed awards amounting to Rs. 32,83,36,357/-including
interest.
c) Thereafter, on December 10, 1998 the Railway Authority filed 26
applications under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
for setting aside those 26 awards. In course of hearing of such applications
under Section 34 of the Act, the Railway Authorities for the first time
alleged that no contract was executed between the parties and that the
petitioner did not execute any work whatsoever and that the petitioner had
committed forgery and was guilty of fabricating documents. It was further
alleged that the petitioner influenced some of the officials of the railways
and in collusion and conspiracy with them procured the award.
d) Subsequently on the complaint of the Railway Administration, the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case being No. R.C. 18 of 1999
dated June 14, 1999 against the petitioner and some railway employees. The sum
and substance of the complaint is that on verification of the signatures in
the tender papers, it was found that the signatures, other than those of two
officers, were not genuine and that one of them was not available in the

the tender papers, it was found that the signatures, other than those of two
officers, were not genuine and that one of them was not available in the
station and was attending a foreign training in U.K. It was further alleged
that seals and stamps available with the letters of the contractor said to be
deposited with the Railway Authority are not genuine because such type of seal
or stamp was not used by the Railway Receipt Section of the concerned offices.
e) It is further alleged that the source of Ballast supply to railway was not
capable to undertake delivery of such huge quantity within a short period of
3/4 months. It was further asserted that signature of one of the P.W. It was
fake and that of two others were found to be visually fake.

the aforesaid FIR mainly on the ground that before lodging such complaint on
