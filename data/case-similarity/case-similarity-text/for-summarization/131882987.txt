interpret the said section literally.
29\. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that the creation of a sub-class within
a class would be unconstitutional. If that is so, the Plaintiff's remedy would
be to challenge the vires of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act for in
its present form, I am bound with the letter of law written therein and cannot
interpret the said provision as Mr. Kohli would have it.
30\. I therefore hold that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the
Commercial Courts Act are only applicable to Commercial Disputes of a
Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value such as
the present suit. Consequently, amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC
by the Commercial Courts Act, the amendment to the CPC mandating that a
Written Statement in a Commercial Suit has to be filed within 120 days, will
not apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value.

    JUDGEMENT:
1\. The present Review Petition has been filed by the Petitioner seeking a
review of the Judgment dated 27th February, 2019 passed by this Court in Axis
Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors.1
2\. Subsequent to the Judgment being delivered, the Petitioner filed a
Praecipe dated 7th March, 2019, which read as under :
> "1. By an order dated 20th August, 2018, this Hon'ble Court framed the

"Whether in view of the amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by a
Commercial Court, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of

2\. Pursuant to the above mentioned Order, this Hon'ble Court was pleased to
decide the above issue by an Order dated 27th February, 2019.
3\. In this regard, the Defendant seeks to approach this Hon'ble Court for
speaking to the minutes to the said Order dated 27th February, 2019 to the
extent that contention of the Defendant with respect to the provisions of the
CPC, 1908 as amended by the Commercial Courts Act not being applicable to a
commercial dispute below a stipulated specified value is left open."
3\. On the Praecipe, the following order came to be passed by this Court on 8
th March, 2019 :
> "XXX
> 2\. Though the contention of the Defendant finds place in Clause 5.25 to
> 5.32 of the Written submissions, no arguments were advanced qua the same.
> The learned Advocate appearing for the Defendant states that he had made
> oral submissions towards the end. My notings speak otherwise. In view
> thereof, the question of speaking to the Minutes as sought does not arise.
> However, the Defendant may move an Application seeking Review."
4\. The present Review Petition has therefore been filed pursuant to the
liberty granted by this Court in the above order. According to the Petitioner,
in the Judgment,  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019
21:58:49 ::: Nitin 4 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc this Court did not decide a
limited contention of the Petitioner viz. that the amendments introduced to
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ("CPC") by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
("Commercial Courts Act") are only applicable to a Commercial Dispute of a
Specified Value and not commercial disputes not of a Specified Value. Section
2 (i) of the Commercial Courts Act prescribes that the Specified Value in
respect of a commercial dispute shall not be less than Rupees Three Lacs.
5\. In the present Suit, the Plaintiff has determined the Specified Value of
its suit at Rupees Twenty Thousand i.e. below the Specified Value as
prescribed under the Commercial Courts Act.
6\. In view of the above, the question of law being decided by this Order is
whether the amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act
apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value but nonetheless heard by
a Commercial Division in view of the proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial
Courts Act ?
7\. It is clarified that the present Order is restricted to only answering the
question of law recorded in paragraph 6 above and disposal of Notice of Motion
(L) No.2118 of 2018. Necessary orders will therefore have to be passed on the
other applications seeking condonation of delay at the time of hearing of each
of such application on its own merits.

5 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc briefly set-out the legislative background leading to
the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act as also certain relevant provisions
thereof : 8.1. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial
Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 was promulgated on 23 rd
October, 2015. Subsequently, the Commercial Courts Act was enacted on 31 st
December, 2015 and is deemed to have come into force from 23rd October, 2015.
8.2. The Commercial Courts Act came to be enacted pursuant to the
recommendations made by the Law Commission of India in its 188 th Report and
253rd Report.
8.3. The primary aim and object of the Commercial Courts Act, as can be
discerned from its Statement of Objects and Reasons, was to provide speedy
disposal of commercial disputes in order to reduce the pendency of cases and
improve our country's image from the perspective of ease of doing business in
India. 8.4. Under Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, Commercial Divisions
were constituted in this Court for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction and
powers conferred under the Commercial Courts Act. Section 4 of the Commercial
Courts Act reads as under :
> " 4. Constitution of Commercial Division of High Court.
> (1) In all High Courts, having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the
> Chief Justice of the High Court may, by order, constitute Commercial
> Division having one or more  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on

> conferred on it under this Act.
> (2) The Chief Justice of the High Court shall nominate such Judges of the
> High Court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be
> Judges of the Commercial Division."
8.5. The Commercial Courts Act establishes Commercial Courts at the District
level and Commercial Divisions in various High Courts ( including those having
ordinary original civil jurisdiction) across India. The Specified Value, as
defined by the Commercial Courts Act, stood earlier at Rupees One Crore.
However, the Commercial Courts Act came to be amended in 2018 by the
Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of
High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018. Amongst other amendments, the Specified
Value stood reduced to Rupees Three Lakhs as against the earlier Rupees One
Crore. 8.6. Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act, which has a bearing on the
issues at hand, provides for the jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions and is
reproduced hereunder :
> " 7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts.
> All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified
> Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction
> shall be heard and disposed of by the  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 :::
> Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 7 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
> Commercial Division of that High Court:
> Provided that all suits and applications relating to commercial disputes,
> stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and
> filed or pending on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and
> disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court:
> Provided further that all suits and applications transferred to the High
> Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 or
> section 104 of the Patents Act, 1970 shall be heard and disposed of by the
> Commercial Division of the High Court in all the areas over which the High
> Court exercises ordinary original civil jurisdiction.
> (emphasis supplied)"
8.7. As can be seen from the above Section, whilst Section 7 mandates that all
suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a Specified Value
filed in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be
heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of that High Court, its first
proviso carves out an exception. The first proviso to Section 7 provides that
all suits and applications relating to Commercial Disputes, stipulated by an
Act to lie in a court not inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending
on the original side of a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the
Commercial Division of that High Court. The suits and applications covered
under the first proviso are those which cannot be filed in a court  :::
Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 8 /
57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc below the District Court or before a High Court. These
are matters we refer to as Intellectual Property Rights matters. These
includes matters pertaining to trademarks and copyright etc. The provisions of
the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and Copyright Act, 1957 contain provisions mandating
that suits under these Acts should not be filed and cannot be entertained by
courts below a District Court. The relevant provisions in this regard are
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and Section 62 of the Copyright Act,
1957. These provisions have been interpreted by this Court to entitle such
suits to be filed on the Original Side of the Bombay High Court irrespective
of their pecuniary jurisdiction.
8.8. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act introduced certain amendments to
the CPC. Section 16 reads as under :
> " 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to
> commercial disputes. (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
> shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute

> Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the
> Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail. "
8.9. Amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC by the Commercial Courts
Act, an amendment was introduced mandating that a Written Statement in a
Commercial Courts Act cannot be filed after 120 days from the service of writ
of summons. The Apex Court, in its decision in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt.
Ltd. vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. 2 and this Court, in
its decision in Axis Bank Limited vs. Mira Gehani & Ors. 3 have held that in
Commercial Suits, a written statement by the Defendant cannot be taken on
record after the expiry of 120 days from the date of service of the Writ of
Summons.
9\. The present Order therefore decides whether or not this mandatory period
of 120 days will apply to Commercial Suits/Commercial Disputes not of a
Specified Value.
10\. Appearing for the Petitioner, Advocate Mr. Rashmin Khandekar submitted
that Section 16 (1) of the Commercial Courts Act makes it clear that the
provisions of the CPC stood amended only in respect of Commercial Disputes of
a Specified Value. He submitted that this Court ought to literally interpret
Section 16 for its language is plain and unambiguous. Therefore, as the
Plaintiff in the present suit has computed the Specified Value at Rs.20,000/-,
the amended provisions of the CPC including the 2 2019 SCC Online SC 226 3

03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 10 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc mandatory proviso to
Order VIII Rule 1 mandating that a Written Statement shall be filed within 120
days will not apply to this Suit. He further submitted that the whole scheme
of the Commercial Courts Act makes it clear that there is a link between
Commercial Disputes and Specified Value under the Act. Mr. Khandekar placed
reliance on the decisions in Indian Overseas Bank vs. Jason Deckor P. Ltd.4;
Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited vs. Tecnimont SpA & Ors.5; Invoke
Medical System Pvt. Ltd. vs. Kunal Structure (India) Pvt. Ltd. 6; Samsung
Leasing Ltd. & Ors. vs. Samsung Electronic Co. Ltd. & Anr. 7 and OCI
Corporation vs. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors8. It was further submitted
that while interpreting any provision of a statute, the plain meaning has to
be given effect to. If the language used in a section gives a simple meaning
and message, it should be interpreted in such a way. The first and primary
rule of construction is that the intention of the legislation must be found in
the words used by the legislature itself. Reliance was also placed by him on
the decisions in Prakash Nath Khanna & Anr. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax &
Anr.9; Union of India vs. National Federation of Blind 10; Tata Power Company
Ltd. & Ors. vs. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors. 11; and
Ajay Enterprises (P) Ltd. & Anr. vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi12. Mr.

::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 11 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
therefore concluded that the question of law be answered to exclude the
applicability of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act in respect of
Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value and that the un-amended CPC be
applicable to matters which pertain to Commercial Disputes but not of a
Specified Value.
11\. As opposed to the aforesaid arguments of Mr. Khandekar, I have heard
Advocate Mr. Nausher Kohli appearing for the Plaintiff. According to Mr.
Kohli, the Petitioner's argument that the amendments to the CPC as introduced
by the Commercial Courts Act apply only to ' commercial disputes' of a
'Specified Value' and not merely 'commercial disputes' is converse to the
mandate, purpose and legislative intent behind the Commercial Courts Act. In
support of his argument, Mr. Kohli relied upon the Preamble, Section 4,
Section 7, the marginal note/heading to Section 16 and the Schedule to the
Commercial Courts Act.
12\. Relying on the Preamble, Mr. Kohli submitted that the Commercial Courts
Act does not restrict itself only to 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value
'. It is also concerned with "matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto". Relying on Section 4, he submitted that as per the mandate of
Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, this Commercial Division has been
constituted for exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under
the Commercial Courts Act. Such jurisdiction and power would necessarily
include the power to enforce, apply and implement the Schedule to the
Commercial Courts Act which introduces amendments to the CPC. Section 4 does
not carve out a distinction between  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 :::
Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 12 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
'commercial disputes' and a 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value'.
According to him, this evidences that the legislature did not intend to create
any distinction so far as the applicability of the provisions of the
Commercial Courts Act is concerned. He submitted that the Commercial Courts
Act, the Law Commission Reports and the discussions on the bill by members of
the Parliament do not refer to a distinct application of the provisions of the
Commercial Courts Act. According to him, it would be akin to absurdity to
apply the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act in a chaotic and irregular
manner as both the types of matters require expeditious resolution in order to
attain the objective for which the Commercial Courts Act was promulgated.
13\. Placing reliance on the marginal note/heading of Section 16 and the
Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act, Mr. Kohli submitted that the Commercial
Courts Act refers to 'commercial disputes' and not 'commercial disputes of a
Specified Value' in the marginal note/heading of Section 16 and in the
Schedule; the amendments introduced to Sections 35, Order VI, Rules 3 and 15
and Order XIII-A of the CPC. Whilst arguing, in fairness, he conceded that a
marginal note/heading cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing a
section, however, he submitted that a marginal note/heading can certainly be
relied upon as indicating the drift of a section or to show what the section
is dealing with. In this respect, he placed reliance on the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.P. Varghese vs.  ::: Uploaded on -
03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 13 / 57
RPL-15-2019-3.doc Income Tax Officer & Anr.13 According to him, had the
legislature intended to create any distinction, there was no reason for the
legislature to omit reference to 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value ' in
the Schedule and marginal note/title to Section 16. Instead, the Schedule and
marginal note/title to Section 16 clarifies that it applies to 'commercial
disputes' whether of a 'Specified Value' or not. Hence, there is admittedly a
conflict between Section 16 on the one hand and (i) the Schedule to the
Commercial Courts Court and (ii) the marginal note/title to Section 16 on the
other hand. In view of the apparent anomalies/inconsistencies/conflicts within
the Commercial Courts Act itself, Mr. Kohli submitted that this Court ought to
interpret Section 16 in a purposive manner and not in a restricted manner as
Mr. Khandekar would have it. According to him, interpreting Section 16
literally would lead to erroneous and unintended consequences. Hence, this
Court ought to interpret the words 'commercial disputes of a Specified Value '
in Section 16 to mean and include 'commercial disputes' covered under the
first proviso to Section 7 as well. In this context, he placed reliance on the
decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Union of India vs Filip Tiago De Gama
of Vedem Vasco De Gama 14; Rajbir Singh Dalal (Dr.) vs Chaudhari Devilal
University, Sirsa15; Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Calcutta vs National

vs Sanjay Dalia18.
14\. Mr. Kohli's second leg of argument was that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments
are accepted, there would be a resultant absurdity in the application of the
Commercial Courts Act. Illustratively, the office of this Court would hence
forth be required to assess not only whether or not a suit filed in this Court
is a ' Commercial Suit' but would also have to enquire into the valuation of
every Intellectual Property Rights matter to govern whether or not it falls
within the ' Specified Value' or not. Upon such assessment, the office of this
Court would next have to assess if the said Plaint so filed is in compliance
with the Commercial Courts Act ( if it is of a 'Specified Value') or
conversely, if the said plaint is in compliance with the CPC as un-amended by
the CPC (if it is not of a 'Specified Value'). In the latter case, the office
of this Court will direct that a Commercial Suit not of a ' Specified Value'
will not be accompanied by a Statement of Truth etc. but would yet be titled
as a ' Commercial Suit' in its cause-title. This, according to him, is an
extreme absurdity resulting from Mr. Khanderkar's interpretation of Section 16
of the Commercial Courts Act. Further, he submitted that whilst Intellectual
Property Rights matters above the ' Specified Value' will be heard by this
Commercial Division and these matters would be governed by the provisions of
the Commercial Courts Act in toto, an Intellectual Property Rights matter not
of a Specified Value will not be governed by all the 18 2015 (10) SCC 161  :::
Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 15
/ 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc provisions of the Commercial Courts Act even though the
said matter is being : i. Adjudicated by the same forum (Commercial Division);
ii. Adjudicated under the Commercial Courts Act;
    iii.           Is a Commercial Suit; and
    iv.            Is a Commercial Suit in relation to an Intellectual Property Rights matter.
This, according to him, could never have been the intent of the legislature.
The Commercial Court Act, having created a separate class of proceedings
labelled as 'Commercial Suits', its procedure must apply in the trial of all
such suits whether of a Specified Value or not. The objective of the
Commercial Courts Act would be defeated if one category of cases i.e. those
filed under the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act, are
merely registered as 'commercial suits' in their cause-title but are not
governed by major provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. This, according to
Mr. Kohli would create a backlog in the Commercial Division, the very mischief
for which the Commercial Courts Act was promulgated, and eventually dampen and
cripple the very objective of the Commercial Courts Act.
15\. Mr. Kohli further submitted that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments are
accepted, an order/decree passed in matters such as the present suit would
continue to be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division despite not being
governed by the procedure under the Commercial Courts Act. This would render
Section 13 otiose as well. The Commercial Courts Act is designed to expedite
such suits and in the absence of such procedure, matters filed in the
Commercial Division emanating from  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 :::
Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 16 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc the
first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act would be effectively
governed by the rules and procedures applicable to non-commercial matters,
defeating the very purpose for which the Commercial Division was created. In
other words, if the submissions of the Petitioner are anything to go by, the
Commercial Division would hear such matters without the aid of the provisions
of the Commercial Courts Act, yet requiring that the Commercial Division
dispose of matters at an expedited pace, resulting in an acute absurdity.
16\. Mr. Kohli also submitted that if Mr. Khandekar's arguments are given any
credence, it would lead to the creation of a further sub-class within a class
as the sub- class of matters under the first proviso to Section 7 would be
separated from the class of other matters under the Commercial Courts Act
without any intelligible differentia. This would be unconstitutional in the
very least as the creation of a sub-class within a class would be hit by
Article 14 of the Constitution. In this context, reliance was placed by him on
the Apex Court's decision in Sansar Chand Atri vs. State of Punjab 19\.
17\. Mr. Kohli concluded that the phrase 'commercial disputes of a Specified
Value' used in Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act ought to be interpreted
to also include 'commercial disputes' governed under the first proviso to
Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act. This, according to him, would be a
proper, rational, consistent and purposive interpretation of the Commercial
Courts Act.
18\. I have considered the aforesaid arguments canvassed by Mr. Khandekar and
19 (2002) 4 SCC 154  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on -
03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 17 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Mr. Kohli. I have also
considered the various decisions of the Apex Court and various High Courts as
cited by them. However, prior to dealing with their respective arguments, it
would be necessary even at the cost of repetition to once again set-out the
subject provision viz. Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act :
> " 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to
> commercial disputes. (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
> shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute
> of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the
> Schedule.
> (2) The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions
> of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial
> of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value.
> (3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any
> amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is
> in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as
> amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as
> amended by this Act shall prevail."
19\. A bare reading of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act begs the
interpretation that the provisions of the CPC shall, in their application to
any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value , stand
amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule to the Commercial Courts
Act and that this Commercial  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on -
03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 18 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc Division, shall follow
the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, in the
trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value .
20\. Whilst I agree with Mr. Kohli in his argument that as per the mandate of
Section 4 of the Commercial Courts Act, this Commercial Division has been
constituted for exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it under
the Commercial Courts Act, in my view, such jurisdiction ought to be exercised
within the four corners of the Commercial Courts Act. An express provision
such as Section 16 cannot be ignored in such manner. It was also Mr. Kohli's
argument that Section 4 does not carve out a distinction between a 'commercial
dispute' and a 'commercial dispute of a Specified Value'. While this may be
so, Section 16 clearly does so.
21\. In so far as Mr. Kohli's reliance on the marginal note/heading to Section
16 is concerned, I believe the extent of reliance this Court can place on a
marginal note/heading of a provision is no longer res integra. In this
context, it would be appropriate to reproduce the following findings of the
Apex Court in its decision rendered in Karnataka Rare Earth vs. Deptt. of
Mines & Geology20 :
> "14. In support of the submission that the demand for the price of mineral

22\. The following judgments and observations contained therein, relied upon
by Mr. Khandekar with respect to the reliance upon a marginal note in
interpreting a section are also relevant:
a. Prakash Nath Khanna & Anr. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr. 21 "16.
Two principles of construction -- one relating to casus omissus and the other
in regard to reading the statute as a whole -- appear to be well settled.
Under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the court
except in the case of clear necessity and when reason for it is found in the
four corners of the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should
not be readily inferred and for that 21 (2004) 9 SCC 686  ::: Uploaded on -
03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 20 / 57
RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose all the parts of a statute or section must be
construed together and every clause of a section should be construed with
reference to the context and other clauses thereof so that the construction to
be put on a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole
statute. This would be more so if literal construction of a particular clause
leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been
intended by the legislature. "An intention to produce an unreasonable result",
said Danckwerts, L.J., in Artemiou v. Procopiou [(1966) 1 QB 878 : (1965) 3
All ER 539 : (1965) 3 WLR 1011 (CA)] (All ER p. 544 I), "is not to be imputed
to a statute if there is some other construction available". Where to apply
words literally would "defeat the obvious intention of the legislation and
produce a wholly unreasonable result", we must "do some violence to the words"
and so achieve that obvious intention and produce a rational construction.
[Per Lord Reid in Luke v. IRC [1963 AC 557 : (1963) 1 All ER 655 : (1963) 2
WLR 559 (HL)] where at AC p. 577 he also observed: (All ER p. 664 I) "This is
not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely
emerges."]
17\. The heading of the section or the marginal note may be relied upon to
clear any doubt or ambiguity in the interpretation of the provision and to
discern the legislative intent. In CIT v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai and Co. [AIR 1950
SC 134] after referring to the view expressed by Lord Macnaghten in Balraj
Kunwar v. Jagatpal Singh [ILR (1904) 26 All 393 : 31 IA 132 : 1 All LJ 384
(PC)] it was held that marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an Act of
Parliament cannot be referred to for the  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 :::
Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 21 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
purpose of construing the statute. Similar view was expressed in Board of
Muslim Wakfs, Rajasthan v. Radha Kishan [(1979) 2 SCC 468] and Kalawatibai v.
Soiryabai [(1991) 3 SCC 410 : AIR 1991 SC 1581]. Marginal note certainly
cannot control the meaning of the body of the section if the language employed
there is clear. (See Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani [(1978) 2 SCC 424 : 1978
SCC (Cri) 236 : AIR 1978 SC 1025] .) In the present case as noted above, the
provisions of Section 276-CC are in clear terms. There is no scope for trying
to clear any doubt or ambiguity as urged by learned counsel for the
appellants. Interpretation sought to be put on Section 276-CC to the effect
that if a return is filed under sub-section (4) of Section 139 it means that
the requirements of sub-section (1) of Section 139 would stand complied with
cannot be accepted for more reasons than one." (Emphasis Supplied) b. Union of
India vs National Federation of Blind 22 "46. The heading of a section or
marginal note may be relied upon to clear any doubt or ambiguity in the
interpretation of the provision and to discern the legislative intent.
However, when the section is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to
traverse beyond those words, hence, the headings or marginal notes cannot
control the meaning of the body of the section. Therefore, the contention of
Respondent 1 herein that the heading of Section 33 of the Act is "Reservation
of posts" will not play a crucial role, when the section is clear and
unambiguous." (Emphasis Supplied) 22 (2013) 10 SCC 772  ::: Uploaded on -

RPL-15-2019-3.doc c. Tata Power Company Ltd. and Ors. vs Maharashtra
Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors 23 "116. Chapter headings and the
marginal note are parts of the statute. They have also been enacted by the
Parliament. There cannot, thus, be any doubt that it can be used in aid of the
construction. It is, however, well settled that if the wordings of the
statutory provision are clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute
with the aid of `chapter heading' and `marginal note' may not arise. It may be
that heading and marginal note, however, are of a very limited use in
interpretation because of its necessarily brief and inaccurate nature. They
are, however, not irrelevant. They certainly cannot be taken into
consideration if they differ from the material they describe.
117\. We may notice some authorities on the subject at the outset.
118\. In Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, Fifth edition, Section 255, it
is stated:
where general words are preceded by a heading indicating a narrower scope it
is legitimate to treat the general words as cut down by the heading.
119\. Section 256 of the said treatise deals with "sidenote, heading or
title", wherein it is stated:
    23 MANU/SC/0932/2009
           ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019                        ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 :::
             Nitin                               23 / 57                  RPL-15-2019-3.doc
Use in interpretation - Like anything else in what Parliament puts out as its
Acts, a sidenote or heading is part of the Act, despite dicta to the contrary.
It may therefore be used by the interpreter. `No judge can be expected to
treat something which is before his eyes as though it were not there. However,
the sidenote or section heading is of very limited use in interpretation
because of its necessarily brief and therefore possibly inaccurate nature.
120\. It was commented:
If the sidenote contradicts the text this puts the interpreter on inquiry; but
the answer may be that the drafter chose an inadequate signpost, or neglected
to alter it to match an amendment made to the clause during the passage of the
Bill. Such facts are outside the knowledge of the interpreter, who must
therefore adopt a rule not depending on them.
...
Modern judges believe it proper to consider sidenotes or headings to sections,
and gather what guidance they can from them. Thus Vinelott J said that the
sidenote to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970 Section 488 (repealed)
was a permissible and useful guide that threw a light on the mischief at which
the section was aimed. Upjohn LJ gave a precisely accurate indication of the
role of the sidenote when he said:
While the marginal note to a section cannot control the language used in the
section ,  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019
21:58:49 ::: Nitin 24 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc it is at least permissible to
approach a consideration of its general purpose and the mischief at which it
is aimed with the note in mind. The italicised words accurately show the
relationship of this component to the informed interpretation rule. Earlier
inconsistent dicta, a selection of which are now considered, must be treated
as erroneous.
121\. In Interpretation of Statutes, Fourth Edition, by Vepa P. Sarathi at
page 347 it is stated:
The heading of a chapter may be referred to in order to determine the sense of
any doubtful expression in a section ranged under it. But it cannot control
unambiguous expressions.
It is true that a heading cannot control the interpretation of a clause if its
meaning is otherwise plain and unambiguous, but it can certainly be referred
to as indicating the general drift of the clause and affording a key to a
better understanding of its meaning.
122\. Similarly in Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P.
Singh, upon noticing the conflicting opinion, the learned Author states: The
view is now settled that the Headings or Titles prefixed to section or group
of sections can be referred to in construing an Act of the Legislature.  :::

Nitin 25 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
123\. Chapter heading, therefore, is a permitted tool of interpretation. It is
considered to be a preamble of that section to which it pertains. It may be
taken recourse to where an ambiguity exists. However, where there does not
exist any ambiguity, it cannot be resorted to. Chapter heading and marginal
note, however, can be resorted to for the purpose of resolving the doubts.
124\. It furthermore appears that there is a drift from the old value in
recent times.
125\. We may notice that the English decisions whereupon reliance had been
placed by this Court in various judgments and in particular Chandler v. DPP
(1962) All ER 142 , str considered to be a no longer a good law in the country
of origin, as stated in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation Fifth Edition at
page 748: Superseded dicta Phillimore LJ referred to a `general rule of law'
to the effect that marginal notes must be disregarded `upon the principle that
those notes are inserted not by Parliament nor under the authority of
Parliament, but by irresponsible persons'. In fact, with occasional trifling
exceptions, the marginal notes in an Act are not inserted by parliamentary
clerks - or even drafters - but are contained either in the Bill as introduced
or in new clauses added by amendment. Furthermore, the clerks are not  :::

/ 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc `irresponsible persons', but are subject to the
authority of Parliament. Avory J. said that `marginal notes form no part of a
statute'. He added : `They are not voted on or passed by Parliament, but are
inserted after the Bill has become law'. This is not the case however. The
entire Act is passed by Parliament and is entered, or deemed to be entered, in
the Parliament Roll with all non-amendable components included. These
components mostly remain unchanged throughout the passage of the Bill. They
are certainly not inserted after the Bill has become law. Willes J. after
asserting that the marginal notes and other `appendages' are not part of an
Act, said of any Act, passed after the practice of actually engrossing Acts on
the Parliament Roll ceased in 1849: `The Act, when passed, must be looked at
just as if it were still entered upon a roll, which it may be again if
Parliament should be pleased so to order; in which case it would be without
these appendages....
126\. It is, however, evident from the decision of this Court in Indian
Aluminium Company v. Kerala State Electricity Board MANU/SC/0310/1975 :
[1976]1SCR70 , that the modern trend is to take into consideration the
marginal note. It could be used, as has been held, in R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax
Officer, Gujarat and Ors. v. Ajit Mills Limited and Anr. MANU/SC/0300/1977 :
[1978]1SCR338 . Relevance of marginal note was also taken note of in Ramesh
Chand and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0389/1979 : [1980]1SCR498 .
127\. In Bombay Dyeing and Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental Action Group
and Ors. MANU/SC/1197/2006 : AIR2006SC1489 , marginal note has been  :::

Section. In Deewan Singh and Ors. v. Rajendra Pd. Ardevi and Ors.
MANU/SC/0207/2007 : AIR2007SC767 it has been held that the marginal note may
be taken into consideration for the purpose of proper construction of the
provision although there is no ambiguity. Sarabjit Rick Singh v. Union of
India (UOI) MANU/SC/0041/2008 : (2008)2SCC417 follows Deewan Singh (supra)."
(Emphasis Supplied)
23\. As can be seen from the above findings, it is now settled law that a
marginal note/heading cannot control the plain words of a section. When the
words used in a provision are clear and unambiguous, a marginal note/heading
cannot be used to alter the interpretation of such provision. I am therefore,
unable to agree with Mr. Kohli's reliance on the marginal note/heading of
Section 16. Similarly, I also cannot agree with Mr. Kohli's reliance on the
Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act. The expressions used in the Schedule to
an enactment cannot control or prevail against the express enactment and in
case of any inconsistency between the Schedule and the enactment, the
enactment is to prevail and if any part of the Schedule cannot be made to
correspond to the Act, it must yield to the Act. In this context, the
following findings of the Apex Court in its decision rendered in Aphali
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra24 :
"31. A Schedule in an Act of Parliament is a mere question of drafting. It is
the legislative intent that is material. An 24 (1989) 4 SCC  ::: Uploaded on -
03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 28 / 57
RPL-15-2019-3.doc Explanation to the Schedule amounts to an Explanation in the
Act itself. As we read in Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edn., Vol. 36,
para 551 [Ed.: See in Fourth Edition, Vol. 44, para 822] :
"To simplify the presentation of statutes, it is the practice for their
subject-matter to be divided, where appropriate, between sections and
Schedules, the former setting out matters of principle, and introducing the
latter, and the latter containing all matters of detail. This is purely a
matter of arrangement, and a Schedule is as much a part of the statute, and as
much an enactment, as is the section by which it is introduced."
The Schedule may be used in construing provisions in the body of the Act. It
is as much an act of legislature as the Act itself and it must be read
together with the Act for all purposes of construction. Expressions in the
Schedule cannot control or prevail against the express enactment and in case
of any inconsistency between the Schedule and the enactment, the enactment is
to prevail and if any part of the Schedule cannot be made to correspond it
must yield to the Act. Lord Sterndale, in IRC v. Gittus [(1920) 1 KB 563]
said: (at p. 576). "It seems to me there are two principles or rules of
interpretation which ought to be applied to the combination of Act and
Schedule. If the Act says that the Schedule is to be used for a certain
purpose and the heading of the part of the Schedule in question shows that it
is prima facie at any rate devoted to that purpose, then you must read the Act
and the Schedule as though the Schedule were operating for that ::: Uploaded
on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 29 / 57
RPL-15-2019-3.doc purpose, and if you can satisfy the language of the section
without extending it beyond that purpose, you ought to do it. But if in spite
of that you find in the language of the Schedule words and terms that go
clearly outside that purpose, then you must give effect to them and you must
not consider them as limited by the heading of that part of the Schedule or by
the purpose mentioned in the Act for which the Schedule is prima facie to be
used. You cannot refuse to give effect to clear words simply because prima
facie they seem to be limited by the heading of the Schedule and the
definition of the purpose of the Schedule contained in the Act."
24\. In this regard, the following observations in the case of Ajay
Enterprises (P) Ltd. and Anr. vs Municipal Corporation Of Delhi 25 relied upon
by Mr. Khandekar are also relevant-
> "There can be no dispute that the various provisions of an enactment are to

25\. Mr. Kohli relied heavily on his submissions that this Court ought to
interpret Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act in a purposive manner.
During the course of arguments, Mr. Kohli relied upon the following decisions
and the findings therein to persuade me in 'purposively' interpreting Section
16 as suggested by him :
25.1 Sansar Chand Atri vs. State of Punjab26 :
" 9. It is relevant to note here that in the certificate issued by the
Ministry of Defence the appellant has been described as an ex-serviceman. The
provision for reservation in the Service Rules is meant for the benefit of ex-
servicemen. The 26 (2002) 4 SCC 154  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 :::
Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 31 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc
purpose is to provide them with suitable jobs in the civil services so that
they may not face difficulty in adjusting themselves in civil society after
leaving the defence service. In the context of the scheme of the provision the
provisions in the Rules should be interpreted in a purposive and reasonable
manner so that the intent and purpose of the provision is served. From the
provisions in the Rules it appears that a distinction has been made for
persons who are released from the army on the ground of medical
disqualification or on the ground of inefficiency or misconduct. Such
distinction is reasonable keeping in view the purpose of reservation of posts
made under the Rules. All the ex-defence service personnel are to be treated
as a class separate from other candidates for the purpose of offer of jobs and
no differentiation or discrimination can be made amongst them unless such
differences are real and substantial. Testing the provisions in this context
we are of the view that a person in the army who has earned pension after
putting in the requisite period of service before leaving the army whether at
his own request or on being released by the employer or on any ground should
be treated as an ex-serviceman who has retired from the army. Such treatment
is to be meted out to all such persons irrespective of whether the
nomenclature used is "released [ As per Corrigendum issued by Supreme Court of
India dated 7-8-2002 No. F.3/Ed. B.J./141/2002] " or "discharged" or
"retired". If the contention raised on behalf of the Service Commission and
the State Government that since the appellant has been ::: Uploaded on -

RPL-15-2019-3.doc discharged from the army at his own request, he cannot be
treated as an ex-serviceman, is accepted then it will create a class within a
class without rational basis and, therefore, becomes arbitrary and
discriminatory. It will also defeat the purpose for which the provision for
reservation has been made.
10\. The High Court, in our view, is not justified in placing reliance on sub-
clause (iv) of the definition clause and excluding the writ petitioners from
the eligible category on that basis. Sub-clause (iv) has no application in the
instant case for the reason that it applies to such of those persons who are
released from service after specific period of engagement and become entitled
to get gratuity. If a person, who served in the armed forces, is released
after being granted the benefit of pension, the case is taken out of the
purview of sub-clause (iv). The exclusionary words "otherwise than at his own

(iv) cannot, therefore, be relied upon to deny the benefit to the appellants.
Then the question arises, whether such person would fall under sub-clause (i)?
True, according to the terminology used in the Service Rules governing the
armed forces there is a distinction between retirement and release/discharge,
as pointed out by the High Court. But, in the context of definition of ex-
serviceman in Rule 2( c )( ii ), the broader meaning has to be given to the
word "retired" occurring in sub-clause ( i ). In principle and in the light of
the considerations set out above, there is no rational basis for excluding
those discharged or ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on -

after earning pension. It is only after considerable period of satisfactory
service a member of the armed forces becomes entitled to pension. The mere
fact that after such long period of service he voluntarily quit the service
with the consent of the employer should not place him in a disadvantageous
position for claiming the benefit of reservation for ex-serviceman. Therefore,
the expression "retirement" should be given wider meaning in order to
effectuate the objective behind the Rule ."

inferred.--It is a corollary to the general rule of literal construction that
nothing is to be added to or taken from a statute unless there are adequate
grounds to justify the inference that the legislature intended something which
it omitted to express. Lord Morsey said: 'It is a strong thing to read into an
Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear
necessity it is a wrong thing to do'. 'We are not entitled', said Lord
Loreburn L.C., 'to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason
for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself'. A case not
provided for in a statute is not to be dealt with merely because there seems
no good reason why it should have been omitted, and the omission appears in
consequence to have been unintentional."
In regard to the latter principle the following statement of law appears in
Maxwell at p. 47:
"A statute is to be read as a whole.--It was resolved in the case of Lincoln
College [(1595) 3 Co. Rep. 58b at p. 59b] that the good expositor of an Act of
Parliament should 'make construction on all the parts together, and not of one
part only by itself'. Every clause of a statute is to 'be construed with
reference to the context and other clauses of the Act, so as, as far as
possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute'." (Per Lord
Davey in Canada Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v.R., 1898 AC 735.) In other words,
under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the Court

four corners ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019

same time a casus omissus should not be readily inferred and for that purpose
all the parts of a statute or section must be construed together and every
clause of a section should be construed with reference to the context and
other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on a particular
provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole statute. This would be
more so if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly
absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the
Legislature. "An intention to produce an unreasonable result", said
Danckwerts, L.J., in Artemiou v. Procopiou (1966 1 QB 878), "is not to be
imputed to a statute if there is some other construction available". Where to
apply words literally would "defeat the obvious intention of the legislation
and produce a wholly unreasonable result" we must "do some violence to the
words" and so achieve that obvious intention and produce a rational
construction. [Per Lord Reid in Luke v. IRC (1966 AC 557) where at p. 577 he
also observed: "this is not a new problem, though our standard of drafting is
such that it rarely emerges".] In the light of these principles we will have
to construe sub-section (2)(b) with reference to the context and other clauses
of Section 33-B.

"31. The aforesaid two reasons given by me, in addition to the reasons already
indicated in the judgment of my learned Brother, would clearly demonstrate
that the provisions of Section 15(2) of the Act require purposive
interpretation so that the aforesaid objective/purpose of such a provision is
achieved thereby. The principle of " purposive interpretation " or " purposive
construction " is based on the understanding that the court is supposed to
attach that meaning to the provisions which serve the " purpose " behind such
a provision. The basic approach is to ascertain what is it designed to
accomplish? To put it otherwise, by interpretative process the court is
supposed to realise the goal that the legal text is designed to realise. As
Aharon Barak puts it:
"Purposive interpretation is based on three components: language, purpose, and
discretion. Language shapes the range of semantic possibilities within which
the interpreter acts as a linguist. Once the interpreter defines the range, he
or she chooses the legal meaning of the text from among the (express or
implied) semantic possibilities. The semantic component thus sets the limits
of interpretation by restricting the interpreter to a legal meaning that the
text can bear in its (public or private) language." [ Aharon Barak, Purposive
Interpretation in Law (Princeton University Press, 2005).]
32\. Of the aforesaid three components, namely, language, purpose and
discretion "of the court", insofar as purposive component is concerned, this
is the ratio juris, the purpose at ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded

text. This purpose is the values, goals, interests, policies and aims that the
text is designed to actualise. It is the function that the text is designed to
fulfil.
33\. We may also emphasise that the statutory interpretation of a provision is
never static but is always dynamic. Though the literal rule of interpretation,
till some time ago, was treated as the " golden rule ", it is now the doctrine
of purposive interpretation which is predominant, particularly in those cases
where literal interpretation may not serve the purpose or may lead to
absurdity. If it brings about an end which is at variance with the purpose of
statute, that cannot be countenanced. Not only legal process thinkers such as
Hart and Sacks rejected intentionalism as a grand strategy for statutory
interpretation, and in its place they offered purposivism, this principle is
now widely applied by the courts not only in this country but in many other
legal systems as well. (Emphasis Supplied)".

approved by the Supreme Court:
'9. ... "the words of a statute, when there is doubt about their meaning, are
to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of
the enactment and the object which the legislature has in view. Their meaning
is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological propriety of
language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on
which they are used, and the object to be attained."
(Workmen v. Dimakuchi Tea Estate [AIR 1958 SC 353] , AIR p. 356, para 9.) The
courts have declined "to be bound by the letter, when it frustrates the patent
purposes of the statute". (Cabell v. Markham [148 F 2d 737 (2d Cir 1945)] ), (
Judge Learned Hand). In the words of Shah, J.:
'8. ... It is a recognised rule of interpretation of statutes that the

they best harmonise with the object of the statute and which effectuate the
object of the legislature.' (New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. CST [AIR 1963 SC

the court will prefer that which advances the remedy and suppresses the
mischief as the legislature envisioned. (Carew & Co. Ltd. v. Union of India

interpretative possibility permits. [Busching Schmitz (P) Ltd. v. P.T.
Menghani [(1977) 2 SCC 835] , SCC pp. 843-44, para 17.] The object-oriented
approach, however, cannot be carried to the extent of doing violence to the
plain language used by rewriting the section or substituting words in place of
the actual words used by the legislature. (CIT v. N.C. Budharaja and Co. [1994
Supp (1) SCC 280] , SCC p. 288, para 13.) Having regard to the object of the
U.P. Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1953 to implement the Bhoodan movement, which aimed at
distribution of land to landless labourers who were versed in agriculture and
who had no other means of subsistence, it was held that the expression
'landless persons' in Section 14, which made provision for grant of land to
landless persons, was limited to landless labourers as described above and did
not include a landless businessman residing in a city. (U.P. Bhoodan Yagna
Samiti v. Braj Kishore [(1988) 4 SCC 274] .)"
33\. In Busching Schmitz (P) Ltd. v. P.T. Menghani [(1977) 2 SCC 835] , it has
been observed that purposive interpretation may be made having regard to the
object of the provisions and to avoid any obvious lacuna.
34\. The learned author Justice G.P. Singh in Interpretation of Statutes, 12th
Edn. has also observed that it is the court's duty to avoid hardship,
inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly while selecting out of
different interpretations. The doctrine must be applied with great care and in
case absurd inconvenience is to be caused that interpretation has to :::

have no bearing for enacting the natural construction. The relevant discussion
at pp. 132-33 and 140-42 is extracted hereunder: "(a) Hardship, inconvenience,
injustice, absurdity and anomaly to be avoided In selecting out of different
interpretations 'the court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and
sensible rather than that which is none of those things' (Holmes v. Bradfield
Rural District Council [(1949) 2 KB 1 : (1949) 1 All ER 381 (DC)] , All ER p.
384) as it may be presumed 'that the legislature should have used the word in
that interpretation which least offends our sense of justice'. (Simms v.
Registrar of Probates [1900 AC 323 (PC)] , AC p. 335.) If the grammatical
construction leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with
the rest of the instrument, it may be departed from so as to avoid that
absurdity and inconsistency. (Grey v. Pearson [(1857) LR 6 HL Cas 61 :
(1843-60) All ER Rep 21] , HLC p. 106.) Similarly, a construction giving rise
to anomalies should be avoided. (N.T. Veluswami Thevar v. G. Raja Nainar [AIR

'7. ... Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and

structure of the sentence.' (Tirath Singh v. Bachittar Singh [AIR 1955 SC 830]
, AIR p. 833, para 7.)"
*** "Consideration of hardship, injustice or absurdity as avoiding a
particular construction is a rule which must be applied with great care. 'The
argument ab inconvenienti', said Lord Moulton, 'is one which requires to be
used with great caution'. (Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors
[1913 AC 107 : (1911-13) All ER Rep 241 (HL)] .) Explaining why great caution
is necessary Lord Moulton further observed: (AC p. 130) '... There is a danger
that it may degenerate into mere judicial criticism of the propriety of the
Acts of legislature. We have to interpret statutes according to the language
used therein, and, though occasionally the respective consequences of two
rival interpretations may guide us in our choice between them, it can only be
where, taking the Act as a whole, and viewing it in connection with the
existing state of the law at the time of the passing of the Act, we can
satisfy ourselves that the words can have been used in the sense to which the
argument points.' (Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1913
AC 107 : (1911-13) All ER Rep 241 (HL)] .) According to Brett, L.J., the
inconvenience necessitating a departure from the ordinary sense of the words
should not only be great but should also be what he calls an 'absurd
inconvenience'. Moreover, individual cases of hardship or injustice have no

46 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc bearing for rejecting the natural construction
(Young & Co. v. Royal Leamington Spa Corpn. [(1883) LR 8 AC 517 (HL)] ), and
it is only when the natural construction leads to some general hardship or
injustice and some other construction is reasonably open that the natural
construction may be departed from. It is often found that laws enacted for the
general advantage do result in individual hardship; for example laws of
Limitation, Registration, Attestation although enacted for the public benefit,
may work injustice in particular cases but that is hardly any reason to depart
from the normal rule to relieve the supposed hardship or injustice in such
cases. (Lucy v. W.T. Henleys Telegraph Works Co. Ltd. [(1970) 1 QB 393 :
(1969) 3 WLR 588 : (1969) 3 All ER 456 (CA)] ) 'It is the duty of all courts
of justice', said Lord Campbell, 'to take care for the general good of the
community, that hard cases do not make bad law'. (East India Co. v. Oditchurn
Paul [(1850) 7 Moo PCC 85 : 13 ER 811] .) 'Absurdity' according to Willes, J.,
should be understood 'in the same sense as repugnance that is to say something
which would be so absurd with reference to the other words of the statute as
to amount to a repugnance'. (Christophersen v. Lotingae [(1864) 33 LJ CP 121]
.) 'Absurdity', said Lord Greene, M.R., 'like public policy, is a very unruly
horse'. (Grundt v. Great Boulder Proprietary Mines Ltd. [1948 Ch 145 : (1948)
1 All ER 21 (CA)] ) He proceeded to add:
'There is one rule, I think which is clear ... that, although the absurdity or

with another may be, and very often is, of assistance to the court in choosing
between two possible meanings of ambiguous words, it is a doctrine which has
to be applied with great care, remembering that Judges may be fallible in this
question of an absurdity and in any event it must not be applied so as to
result in twisting language into a meaning which it cannot bear. It is a
doctrine which must not be used to rewrite the language in a way different
from that in which it was originally framed.' (Grundt v. Great Boulder
Proprietary Mines Ltd. [1948 Ch 145 : (1948) 1 All ER 21 (CA)] , Ch pp.
159-60.) The alternative construction contended for must be such which does
not put an undue strain on the words used; (Kanailal Sur v. Paramnidhi
Sadhukhan [AIR 1957 SC 907] ) and does not require recasting of the Act or any
part of it. It must be possible to spell the meaning contended for out of the
words actually used. (Shamrao V. Parulekar v. District Magistrate, Thana [AIR
1952 SC 324 : 1952 Cri LJ 1503] .) No doubt in cases of ambiguity that
construction which better serves the ends of fairness and justice will be
accepted, but otherwise it is for the legislature in forming its policy to
consider these elements. (IRC v. Mutual Investment Co. Ltd. [1967 AC 587 :
(1966) 3 WLR 740 : (1966) 3 All ER 265 (PC)] ) If no alternative construction
is open, the court cannot ignore a statutory provision 'to relieve what it
considers a distress resulting from its operation; a statute has to be given
effect to whether the court likes it or not'. (Martin ::: Uploaded on -

RPL-15-2019-3.doc Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutta [AIR 1966 SC 529] .) The
function of the court is to find out what is legal and not what is right.
(Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S. Guram [(1986) 4 SCC 447] .) It is
presumed that a legislative body intends which is the necessary effect of its
enactments; the object, the purpose and the intention of the enactment is the
same; it need not be expressed in any recital or Preamble; and it is not
competent for any court judicially to ascribe any part of the legal operation
of the statute to inadvertence. (Kariapper v. Wijesinha [1968 AC 717 : (1967)
3 WLR 1460 : (1967) 3 All ER 485 (PC)] .) The courts should as far as possible
avoid a construction which results in anomalies. (N.T. Veluswami Thevar v. G.
Raja Nainar [AIR 1959 SC 422] .)"
35.Bennion on Statutory Interpretation has mentioned law to the same effect
under Section 312 and has observed that there is a presumption that absurd
result is not intended and in Section 314 it has been observed that the court
has to avoid an inconvenient result while interpreting a provision. It was
stated that it can be presumed that Parliament intends that while construing
an enactment the court will avoid a construction that is unworkable or
impracticable, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical as the same is unlikely to
be intended by Parliament. In Rosali V. v. TAICO Bank [(2009) 17 SCC 690 :

36\. This Court in Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [Sonic
Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2010) 1 SCC 135 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ)
28] has also laid down law to the same effect and has discussed the term
"branch office" used in Section 17(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 in
the context of cause of action. Section 17(2) of the said Act reads thus: (SCC
p. 138, para 7) "7. ... '17. (2) A complaint shall be instituted in a State
Commission within the limits of whose jurisdiction--
(a) the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more
than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and
voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch office or
personally works for gain; or
(b) any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of
the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries
on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain, provided that
in such case either the permission of the State Commission is given or the
opposite parties who do not reside or carry on business or have a branch
office or personally works for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in such
institution; or
(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.'" This Court while
interpreting the provision held that the term "branch office" as used in the
amended Section 17(2)(b) has to be interpreted to mean only that branch office
where the ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49
::: Nitin 50 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc cause of action has arisen. Thus, the
court departed from the plain and literal meaning of the words of Section
17(2)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act in order to avoid absurdity. The
decision in Sonic Surgical [Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Co. Ltd.,
(2010) 1 SCC 135 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 28] has been approved by this Court in
State of M.P. v. Narmada Bachao Andolan [(2011) 7 SCC 639 : (2011) 3 SCC (Civ)
875] inasmuch as this Court has observed that in case the natural meaning
leads to mischievous consequences, it must be avoided by accepting other
permissible construction.
(emphasis supplied)".
26\. Whilst the aforesaid judgments reflect that the courts therein have
purposively interpreted the subject provisions therein, I do not deem it
necessary to depart from the foremost principle of statutory interpretation
viz. the literal rule of interpretation. In this context, the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of B. Premanand vs. Mohan Koikal32 and the
following findings therein:
> "9. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and foremost
> principle of interpretation of a statute in every system of interpretation
> is the literal rule of interpretation.
The other rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive
interpretation, etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute
are ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if read literally would
nullify the very object of the statute. Where the words of a statute are 32
(2011) 4 SCC 266  ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019
21:58:49 ::: Nitin 51 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc absolutely clear and unambiguous,
recourse cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other than the
literal rule, vide Swedish Match AB v. SEBI [(2004) 11 SCC 641 : AIR 2004 SC
4219] .
16\. Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope for importing any rule
of interpretation (vide Pandian Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT [(2003) 5 SCC 590] ). It
is only where the provisions of a statute are ambiguous that the court can
depart from a literal or strict construction (vide Nasiruddin v. Sita Ram
Agarwal [(2003) 2 SCC 577 : AIR 2003 SC 1543] ). Where the words of a statute
are plain and unambiguous effect must be given to them (vide Bhaiji v. SDO
[(2003) 1 SCC 692] ).
17\. No doubt in some exceptional cases departure can be made from the literal
rule of the interpretation, e.g. by adopting a purposive construction, Heydon
[Heydon case, (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a : 76 ER 637] mischief rule, etc. but that
should only be done in very exceptional cases. Ordinarily, it is not proper
for the court to depart from the literal rule as that would really be amending
the law in the garb of interpretation, which is not permissible (vide J.P.
Bansal v. State of Rajasthan[(2003) 5 SCC 134 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 605 : AIR 2003
SC 1405] and State of Jharkhand v. Govind Singh [(2005) 10 SCC 437 : 2005 SCC
(Cri) 1570 : JT (2004) 10 SC 349] ). It is for the legislature to amend the
law and not the court (vide State of Jharkhand v. Govind Singh [(2005) 10 SCC
437 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1570 : JT (2004) 10 SC 349] ). ::: Uploaded on -

18\. In Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi [(2003) 1 SCC 730] (SCC p. 733,
para 5) this Court observed [Ed.: As observed in Raghunath Rai Bareja v.
Punjab National Bank, (2007) 2 SCC 230, p. 245, para 48.] :
"48. ... The court cannot legislate under the garb of interpretation."
Hence, there should be judicial restraint in this connection, and the
temptation to do judicial legislation should be eschewed by the Courts. In
fact, judicial legislation is an oxymoron.
19\. In Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers [(2003) 6 SCC
659 : AIR 2003 SC 2434] this Court observed: (SCC p. 669, para 19) "19. It is
a well-settled principle in law that the court cannot read anything into a
statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. A statute is an edict of
the legislature. The language employed in a statute is the determinative
factor of legislative intent."
20\. Where the language is clear, the intention of the legislature has to be
gathered from the language used (vide Grasim Industries Ltd. v. Collector of
Customs [(2002) 4 SCC 297] and Union of India v. Hansoli Devi [(2002) 7 SCC
273] ).
21\. In Union of India v. Hansoli Devi [(2002) 7 SCC 273] this Court observed:
(SCC p. 281, para 9) ::: Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on -
03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 53 / 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc "9. ... It is a
cardinal principle of construction of a statute that when the language of the
statute is plain and unambiguous, then the court must give effect to the words
used in the statute and it would not be open to the courts to adopt a
hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more
consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act."
22\. The function of the court is only to expound the law and not to legislate
(vide District Mining Officer v. TISCO [(2001) 7 SCC 358] ). If we accept the
interpretation canvassed by the learned counsel for the private respondents,
we will really be legislating because in the guise of interpretation we will
be really amending Rule 27(c) of the Rules.
23\. In Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra [(2001) 4 SCC 534
: AIR 2001 SC 1980] , this Court observed: (SCC pp. 552-53, para 26) "26. ...
it is a cardinal principle of interpretation of statute that the words of a
statute must be understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and
construed according to their grammatical meaning, unless such construction
leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context or in the
object of the statute to suggest to the contrary. The golden rule is that the
words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet
another rule of construction that when the words of the statute are clear, :::
Uploaded on - 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 54
/ 57 RPL-15-2019-3.doc plain and unambiguous, then the courts are bound to
give effect to that meaning, irrespective of the consequences. It is said that
the words themselves best declare the intention of the law-giver. The courts
have adhered to the principle that efforts should be made to give meaning to
each and every word used by the legislature and it is not a sound principle of
construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite surpluses,
if they can have a proper application in circumstances conceivable within the
contemplation of the statute."
The same view has been taken by this Court in Harshad S. Mehta v. State of
Maharashtra [(2001) 8 SCC 257 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1447] (vide SCC para 34) and
Patangrao Kadam v. Prithviraj Sayajirao Yadav Deshmukh [(2001) 3 SCC 594 : AIR
2001 SC 1121] .
24\. The literal rule of interpretation really means that there should be no
interpretation. In other words, we should read the statute as it is, without
distorting or twisting its language. We may mention here that the literal rule
of interpretation is not only followed by Judges and lawyers, but it is also
followed by the layman in his ordinary life. To give an illustration, if a
person says "this is a pencil", then he means that it is a pencil; and it is
not that when he says that the object is a pencil, he means that it is a
horse, donkey or an elephant. In other words, the literal rule of
interpretation simply means that we mean what we say and we say what we mean.
If we do not follow the literal rule of interpretation, ::: Uploaded on -
03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 55 / 57
RPL-15-2019-3.doc social life will become impossible, and we will not
understand each other. If we say that a certain object is a book, then we mean
it is a book. If we say it is a book, but we mean it is a horse, table or an
elephant, then we will not be able to communicate with each other. Life will
become impossible. Hence, the meaning of the literal rule of interpretation is
simply that we mean what we say and we say what we mean."
27\. In my view, literally interpreting Section 16, the interpretation that
follows is that the amendments introduced by Section 16 apply only to
Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a
Specified Value. This is the letter of law. Section 16, as it reads currently
ought to be interpreted literally. In Kanai Lal Sur vs. Paramnidhi
Sadhukhan33, it was held by the Apex Court that if the words used are capable
of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts to adopt any
other hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more
consistent with the alleged object and policy of the subject Act. Further, the
Apex Court, in its decision rendered in Commr. of Customs v. Dilip Kumar &
Co.,34 has held thus :
> "21.The well-settled principle is that when the words in a statute are
> clear, plain and unambiguous and only one meaning can be inferred, the
> courts are bound to give effect to the said meaning irrespective of
> consequences. If the words in the statute are plain and unambiguous, it
> becomes necessary 33 AIR 1957 SC 907 34 (2018) 9 SCC 1  ::: Uploaded on -
> 03/06/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 03/06/2019 21:58:49 ::: Nitin 56 / 57
> RPL-15-2019-3.doc to expound those words in their natural and ordinary
> sense. The words used declare the intention of the legislature."
28\. Additionally, as submitted by Mr. Kohli, there may be certain inefficient
consequences resulting from the literal interpretation of Section 16.
Illustratively, the present Suit is titled a 'Commercial Suit' and yet, would
be governed by the un- amended CPC. However, in my view, should the
legislature deem fit, it may carry out an amendment to overcome these
consequences and/or may provide a clarification if it so deems fit. Till such
time, I am currently bound by the language of Section 16 and am inclined to
interpret the said section literally.
29\. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that the creation of a sub-class within
a class would be unconstitutional. If that is so, the Plaintiff's remedy would
be to challenge the vires of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act for in
its present form, I am bound with the letter of law written therein and cannot
interpret the said provision as Mr. Kohli would have it.
30\. I therefore hold that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the
Commercial Courts Act are only applicable to Commercial Disputes of a
Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value such as
the present suit. Consequently, amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC
by the Commercial Courts Act, the amendment to the CPC mandating that a
Written Statement in a Commercial Suit has to be filed within 120 days, will
not apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value.

interpret the said provision as Mr. Kohli would have it.
30\. I therefore hold that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the
Commercial Courts Act are only applicable to Commercial Disputes of a
Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value such as
the present suit. Consequently, amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC
by the Commercial Courts Act, the amendment to the CPC mandating that a
Written Statement in a Commercial Suit has to be filed within 120 days, will
not apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value.

29\. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that the creation of a sub-class within
a class would be unconstitutional. If that is so, the Plaintiff's remedy would
be to challenge the vires of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act for in
its present form, I am bound with the letter of law written therein and cannot
