fold) in the assessable value was justifiable as best judgement assessment
under Section 72 ibid. The appellant made elaborate arguments in its written
submissions that the service received by it did not satisfy the definition of
franchise service under Section 65 (105) (zze) ibid, but the adjudicating
authority summarily states (without any analysis) that its contentions do not
hold ground. Indeed, as brought out hereinabove, perusal of paragraphs 36 to
41 of the impugned order quoted above makes it so amply clear that the order
fatally suffers from lack of analysis/discussion regarding the contentions and
arguments of the appellant and makes a mockery of the quasi-judicial process
in-as-much-as it is not merely non-speaking, but also absurd in parts. The
Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kishore Jha Vs. State of Bihar [2003 (11) SCC
519)] has held that reasons are heart beat of every conclusion, without the

2\. The facts of the case are as under:-
The appellant was centrally registered for service tax at Gurgaon under the
categories of :Transport of Goods by Road Service, Intellectual Property
Service other than Copyright, Management Consultants Service, Test,
Inspection, Certification Service, Market Research Agency Service and
Scientific and Technical Consultancy Service. The appellant was
manufacturing beer under the Trademarks owned by M/s. Carlsberg Breweries A/S,
Denmark. The appellant entered into the India Licence Agreement (ILA) dated
07.12.2006 with Carlsberg Denmark and has been manufacturing beer under
trademarks Carlsberg, Tuborg and Palone owned by Carlsberg Denmark under
the ILA and addendum to the ILA dated 25.09.2008. At the time of entering into
the ILA, the trademarks, Carlsberg and Tuborg were already registered in
India vide Registration No.139539 and 127793 respectively. The trademark
Palone was registered in India w.e.f. 18.04.2007 vide the trademark
registration certificate dated 27.02.2012.
The aforesaid demands were confirmed on the amount of royalty paid to M/s.
Carlsberg Denmark on which the appellant did not discharge service tax
liability. When the case was taken up for stay application during the hearing,
both sides agreed that the appeal itself could be disposed of. Accordingly, we
waive the requirement of pre-deposit and proceed to dispose of the appeal.
3\. Ld. advocate for the appellant essentially contended that
(i) The appellant had made the following statements before the adjudicating
authority:-
(a) Carlsberg Denmark was not providing franchise service to the appellant
under the ILA. Hence, the demand under franchise service is not sustainable.
(b) The transaction relating to the trademark Palone is in the nature of
permitting the use of intellectual property which is not recognised in India
and hence not liable to service tax.
(c) Transfer of know-how to the appellant was a transaction in property and
not that of a service. Therefore, payments made cannot be liable to service
tax.
(d) More than one Show Cause Notice for the transactions regarding granting of
the right to use the trademarks under the ILA were issued during the same
relevant period and that too demanding service tax under two different taxable
services, namely Franchise Service and IPR Service.
(e) No consideration has been paid by the appellant to Carlsberg, Denmark.
Hence, no service tax is payable on the alleged service.
(f) Even assuming without accepting that there was a consideration for the
grant of the right to use the unregistered trademark Palone, since the
transaction involves no taxable service, there arises no taxable value and
hence no service tax can be demanded on such transaction.
(g) As per Rule 7(1) of the Import of Service (IOS) Rules, actual
consideration charged for the service provided is the taxable value but during
02.06.2007 to 01.06.2010 no amount was charged by Carlsberg Denmark from the
appellant for the right to use the registered trade mark.
(h) The Show Cause Notice proceeds on the wrong understanding that there was
consideration not wholly consisting of money.
(i) The arrangement between the appellant and Carlsberg Denmark did not
satisfy the ingredients of a franchise agreement.
(j) Even if it is assumed without accepting that non-monetary consideration is
involved in the impugned transaction, the value of similar services by
Carlsberg, Denmark to any other person is the taxable value to be adopted.
(k) Without prejudice to the other submissions, it was submitted that the
amount alleged to have been paid by the appellant must be treated as cum-tax
amount and service tax has to be calculated accordingly.
(l) There was no wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts and so extended
period of limitation cannot be invoked in the present case which will make
substantial part of demand time barred.
(ii) The appellant made elaborate submissions on each of the aforesaid points
which are not being repeated here. It also demonstrated that similar
submissions were made before the adjudicating officer too. It also claimed to
have provided the actual figures to the Commissioner but the Commissioner
resorted to best judgement assessment in respect of demand confirmed under
franchise service for the periods 2010-11 and 2011-12. Under the best
judgement assessment, the figure for 2010-11 was taken to be double of the
preceding year and the figures for 2011-12 was taken as 10 times that for
2010-11 without giving any basis.
(iii) The adjudicating authority did not give any finding in respect of any of
the submissions made by the appellant and the demand was confirmed by making
baseless observations in para-36, 38 and 40 of the impugned order. Thus the
order is non-speaking and hence unsustainable.
4\. Ld. Departmental Representative essentially reiterated the contents of the
impugned order.
5\. We have considered the contentions of both sides and perused the records.
In view of the submissions/ contentions of the appellant, particularly the one
asserting that its contentions have not been dealt with by the adjudicating
authority, we deem it proper to quote paras 36 to 41 of the impugned order,
which contain the entire analysis in the impugned order and are reproduced
below:-
36. In view of the above mentioned submissions I am of the view that:
The Indian subsidiary and the foreign principal entered into an agreement
dated December, 2006, whereunder the Indian subsidiary was required to pay
royalty to the foreign principal and the foreign principal was reimbursing the
same amount as marketing support. There was neither book entry nor actual flow
of funds vide addendum dated September 2008 both the payments were waived off
retrospectively, so licence to use the trade mark was always free for the
first 36 months (production started from June 2007 to 1st June 2010).
Carlsberg and Tuborg Trademarks are registered with Indian Registrar
(w.e.f.09.07.49 & 07.02.47), Palone the third Trademark was registered in
India (18.04.2007) given (2012) retrospectively. The departments allegation is
waiving off right is a service  non monetary consideration = Royalty (tax was
charged on IPR & Franchisee Service). The last two SCNs are based on Best
Judgement. Further the benefit of Notification No.17/2004-ST towards R&B cess
was not given. Further SCNs are based on details submitted during
investigation and there is quantification error by the tax payer after
submitting the reply in March 2012. Further, issues are made clear in the
following paragraph.
M/s. Carlsberg India Pvt. Ltd. (Indian subsidiary) entered into an INDIA
LICENCE AGREEMENT in the nature of Intellectual Property Service prescribed
under Section 65(55a) ibid, effective from 10.09.2004, with M/s. Carlsberg
Breweries A/S Denmark (foreign Principal) to manufacture and sell the licenced
products using Trademarks Carlsberg and Tuborg in the territory, on a
temporary basis. Further, In view of the aforementioned discussions, it is
clear that, the said agreements between M/s. CIPL & M/s. Carlsberg Breweries
A/S, Denmark are  clearly in the nature of temporary transfer of the use of
Trademark, which is owned by M/s. Carlsberg Breweries A/s, Denmark. Therefore
it is clear that the Ms. Carlsberg Breweries A/S, Denmark has provided the
service to M/s. CIPL, which falls under the category of Franchisee Service,
defined under Section 65 (105) (zze) ibid, effective from 01.07.2003 as
amended and the contentions of the noticee that M/s. Carlsberg Denmark was not
providing Franchisee service to the Noticee under ILA hence demand is not
sustainable, is not correct and does not hold ground. Further, it is observed
that M/s. Carlsberg Breweries A/S, Denmark and M/s. CIPL has mutually agreed
to waive-off their respective legal rtights of Royalty and Above-the-Line
activity marketing contribution claim, which is equal to the Royalty and the
consideration is an act of forbearance, or a promise thereof, which is offered
by one party to an agreement and accepted by other, as inducement to the
others act or promise, and therefore it is clear, that M/s. CIPL is liable
for payment of Service Tax under Section 67(ii) of Finance Act, 1994 on the
amount of Royalty paid in the form of consideration.
37\. I therefore hold that M/s. CIPL is liable to pay service tax on amount of
royalty paid to M/s. Carlsberg breweries A/s, Denmark in terms of notification
no.11/2006-ST dt.19.04.2006, and it is also observed that M/s. CIPL failed to
determine the gross value of service tax in respect of Franchise services as
shown in reply to SCN.
38\. The next point for discussion is:
Whether extended period of limitation is applicable for demanding the service
tax in terms of proviso to Section 73 (1) of Act, as the party has
deliberately tried to suppress the facts from the department and contravened
the provisions of the said act & rules made there-under.
In the present case I find that since M/s. Carlsberg India Pvt. Ltd. have
wilfully suppressed all the material facts regarding the nature of services
provided by them in respect of Intellectual Property Service Other than
Copyright and the gross amount received by them during the aforesaid period
as Royalty/franchisee services and at no stage did they enquire about
taxability of their services. It is due to the investigation by the
department, that the said facts of providing the services & non-payment of
service tax by them came to notice. I find that the extended period of five
years under proviso to section 73(1) of the Finance Act 1994 has been
correctly invoked in the present case.
39\. The next two points for discussion are:
(i) Whether interest is liable to be demanded and recovered under Section 75
of the Act ibid.
(ii) Whether M/s CIPL is liable for penalty under Section76, 77 & 78 of the
Act ibid.
40\. I find that since the demand of service tax in the instant case is being
confirmed, therefore:
(ii) Penalty is to be imposed upon them under Section 78 of Chapter V of the
Finance Act, 1994, for not paying the appropriate Service Tax with an-intent
to evade payment of Service Tax and/or by suppressing the facts & value of
taxable service from the Service Tax Department.
(iii) Penalty needs to be imposed upon them under Section 76 of Chapter V of
the Finance Act, 1994 for not paying the appropriate Service Tax by the
prescribed due dates;
(iv) Interest on the amount determined to be payable by the said noticee
should be charged from them under Section 75 of Chapter V of the Finance Act,
1994.
41\. Further the Demand raised in the five other Show Cause Notices issued
vide C.No.
1\. D-III/ST/R-II/SCN/ Carlsberg/187/2010/2564 dated 15.06.2011  Amount
Rs.46,11,774/-
2\. D-III/ST/R-II/SCN/ Carlsberg/187/2010/5929 dated 18.10.2011  Amount
Rs.30,74,516/-
3\. D-III/ST/R-II/SCN/ Carlsberg/187/2010/5929 dated 18.10.2011  Amount
Rs.30,74,516/-
4\. D-III/ST/R-II/SCN/ Carlsberg/187/2010/3076 dated 23.08.2012 
Rs.35,76,049/-
5\. D-III/ST/R-II/SCN/ Carlsberg/187/2010/4649 dated 18.10.2012  Amount
Rs.4,51,66,650/-.
On similar issue is being confirmed on same lines as per CBEC Circular
No.752/68/2003-CX dated 1.10.2003, and M/s. CIPL is liable to pay interest and
penalty in the similar ratio as per order in the instant case, along with
service tax demanded respectively in each case. From the perusal of the
aforesaid paragraphs, it becomes loud and clear that none of the contentions
of the appellant have been analysed in the impugned order. Even the
contentions regarding non-invocability of the extended period were brushed
aside rather summarily as is evident from para-38 of the impugned order quoted
above. We note that the adjudicating authority has observed that the appellant
deliberately tried to suppress the facts from the Department and then adds
that M/s. Carlsberg India Pvt. Ltd. wilfully suppressed all the material
facts regarding nature of service provided by them in respect of Intellectual
Property Services other than Copyright and the gross amount received by them
during the aforesaid period as royalty / franchisee service and at no stage
did they enquire about taxability of their services. It is obvious that the
paragraph has been written without application of mind because in the present
case no amount was received by the appellant as royalty/franchise service;
indeed the appellant paid the amount to foreign based company. The appellant
did not provide the alleged services, but was the recipient of the alleged
services. Similarly, we find that the appellant had contended that it had
provided the figures for the period 2010-11 and 2011-12, but still the best
judgement assessment under Section 72 ibid has been resorted to. As stated
earlier, in the Show Cause Notice dated 18.10.2012, the figures for 2011-12
have been taken to be 10 times those for 2010-11 under the best judgment
assessment without any basis / reason which almost smacks of outright mala
fide and the adjudicating authority blindly adopted those figures under best
judgment assessment without even a whisper as to how such a quantum jump (ten
fold) in the assessable value was justifiable as best judgement assessment
under Section 72 ibid. The appellant made elaborate arguments in its written
submissions that the service received by it did not satisfy the definition of
franchise service under Section 65 (105) (zze) ibid, but the adjudicating
authority summarily states (without any analysis) that its contentions do not
hold ground. Indeed, as brought out hereinabove, perusal of paragraphs 36 to
41 of the impugned order quoted above makes it so amply clear that the order
fatally suffers from lack of analysis/discussion regarding the contentions and
arguments of the appellant and makes a mockery of the quasi-judicial process
in-as-much-as it is not merely non-speaking, but also absurd in parts. The
Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kishore Jha Vs. State of Bihar [2003 (11) SCC
519)] has held that reasons are heart beat of every conclusion, without the
same it is lifeless. In the present case, in the absence of
analysis/reasoning with reference to the contentions of the appellant, the
conclusions drawn in the impugned order are rendered lifeless.
6\. In the light of foregoing analysis, we set aside the impugned order and
remand the case to the adjudicating authority for de novo adjudication after
giving the appellant an opportunity of being heard.

analysis/reasoning with reference to the contentions of the appellant, the
conclusions drawn in the impugned order are rendered lifeless.

judgment assessment without even a whisper as to how such a quantum jump (ten
fold) in the assessable value was justifiable as best judgement assessment
under Section 72 ibid. The appellant made elaborate arguments in its written
submissions that the service received by it did not satisfy the definition of
franchise service under Section 65 (105) (zze) ibid, but the adjudicating
authority summarily states (without any analysis) that its contentions do not
hold ground. Indeed, as brought out hereinabove, perusal of paragraphs 36 to
41 of the impugned order quoted above makes it so amply clear that the order
fatally suffers from lack of analysis/discussion regarding the contentions and
arguments of the appellant and makes a mockery of the quasi-judicial process
in-as-much-as it is not merely non-speaking, but also absurd in parts. The
Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kishore Jha Vs. State of Bihar [2003 (11) SCC
519)] has held that reasons are heart beat of every conclusion, without the
same it is lifeless. In the present case, in the absence of
analysis/reasoning with reference to the contentions of the appellant, the
conclusions drawn in the impugned order are rendered lifeless.
