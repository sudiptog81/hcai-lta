predicated on design infringement. It does not urge passing off nor claims any
relief in that regard. Likewise, the fact that Aashiana or someone connected
with it was an ex-licensee of the plaintiff, cannot in any manner be a
material factor to grant injunction since issues in respect of confidentiality
do not appear to have been pleaded. Likewise, the allegation that a particular
manufacturer who performed job work for Kamdhenu did so for Aashiana, is also
of no relevance.
23\. The only issue that the learned Single Judge dwelt upon and pronounced to
be the basis of the plaintiff‟s prima facie strength, on the merits of the
case, was that of infringement based upon registration. Given that the
relevant and material circumstances with respect to prior publication were not
taken into account and analysed in the proper perspective, this court is of
the opinion that the observations with respect to the existence of prima facie
case cannot be upheld. They are hereby set aside.
24\. In view of the above findings, the I.A. No. 12872/2017 in CS (OS)

                                      JUDGMENT
% S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
1\. This appeal by the defendant (hereafter referred to as "Aashiana"),
questioning the temporary ad-interim injunction issued by the learned Single
Judge on 03.11.2017, in a suit by the plaintiff/respondent (hereafter
"Kamdhenu"). Kamdhenu alleged that Aashiana had infringed its registered
design in the sale of the latter‟s FRIENDS 500 HD steel bars. Aashiana
contended that Kamdhenu could not establish its registered design prima facie
to be novel and FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 1 of 18 exclusive from the record so as
to justify the impugned ad interim temporary injunction.
2\. Briefly, the case set up in the suit is that the plaintiff manufactures
and markets steel bars and other allied goods under the name and trademark,
Kamdhenu®. It also claimed that to distinguish its TMT bars from the other
bars in the market, it developed a unique design with new and original
features of surface pattern, comprising of double ribs applied to 16 bars.
This development took place in 2012. Kamdhenu applied for registration under
the Designs Act, 2000; its claim was accepted, and the registration was
granted in Class 25-01 with effect from 14.01.2013, by certificate issued on
29.08.2014 by the Patents and Designs Controller General. Kamdhenu applied the
design to its product, known as SS 10,000 TMT, which it claims is the best
quality steel bar. This resulted in its „sole right to utilize a design in an
artistic manner‟ and use it for its products or adoption of any identical or
similar design.
3\. The suit alleged that Kamdhenu became aware in the first week of June 2017
about the infringement by Aashiana, when it came across TMT bars and leaflets
relating to the defendant‟s goods bearing the trademark 'Friends 500 HD' in
the markets of South Delhi. The suit alleged that Aashiana applied and copied,
adopted and imitated design identical to Kamdhenu‟s registered design in Class
25.01 and its registered trademark. It claimed that the surface pattern on the
double ribs used and applied to Aashiana‟s TMT bars was identical or
substantially similar to its design. These were an obvious imitation of
FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 2 of 18 the plaintiffs registered design and this use of
the design with the intention of imitating and using the plaintiffs registered
design was fraudulent and would amount to an infringement.
4\. At the stage of issue of summons, the learned Single Judge also issued an
ex parte injunction order. Aashiana entered defense and urged that Kamdhenu
had played a fraud on the design office by misrepresenting itself as the owner
and originator of the designs in question. It pointed out that the design was
copied from British standard BS 4449: 2005 category B500 C. These documents,
according to Aashiana were suppressed by Kamdhenu. It asserted that the design
was used as a standard for reinforcement bars worldwide and was in force since
1984 and that such standard was adopted by several countries, including
Germany and the United Kingdom. Aashiana asserted that Kamdhenu could not
enclose or claim any monopoly rights over an impugned design, which was a mere
replication of the prevailing standard in respect of the goods.
5\. Aashiana argued that to comply with the BS500C standard the manufacturer
had to necessarily follow the transverse rib arrangement depicted in the
standard published in 1984. According to Aashiana, Kamdhenu registered design
was liable to be cancelled under section 19 of the Design Act. Aashiana also
stated that it was in the business of manufacture and sale of steel bars,
including TMT bars, since 1998, in Gujarat; its articles are approved by the
standards organization- Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and that the impugned
articles were designed in June 2017 and Aashiana, thereafter, commenced their
trial FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 3 of 18 production. Samples of those goods were
sent to the government approved labs for trial and testing purposes. Soon
thereafter in June 2017, shape and surface pattern of the impugned product was
in terms of what was prescribed by British standard BS for 49:2005 category D
500 C designs which had existed in the public domain. They confirmed to the
categorization of reinforcing bars within the B500C standard. Aashiana
complained that plaintiff could not have secured registration under the Design
Act. In fact, it copied the design from the surface pattern proposed and laid
out in the B500C class. It stated that it was in the process of filing a
cancellation petition before the Controller of Designs in accordance with law.
6\. This defense evoked a replication by Kamdhenu which besides reiterating
the plaintiff‟s stand in the suit, saw Kamdhenu asserting that the design it
obtained registration for was unique and novel. Kamdhenu stated that it
produced bars, with ribs inclined 48° and 65°, being unique to it. It submits
that the British Standards do not speak of this particular degree (or incline
of the ribs on the bars) and it was not mentioned in the specific standard
cited by the defendant or in BS 500C and relied upon by it. It is stated that
the allegations are to be seen in the context of the fact that the exact same
angles were copied by Aashiana which disclosed its intention to imitate and
infringe the plaintiff‟s registered design. It was also highlighted that
Aashiana‟s director was an ex-employee of the plaintiff. The machine operator,
who used to work for the plaintiff, has also now been engaged by Aashiana to
manufacture infringing goods.

7\. The learned Single Judge while granting the interim temporary injunction
till final decision in the suit, reasoned as follows:
> "11. The plaintiff undoubtedly is the prior user of the design since 2013.
> As per the defendant's admission, it started trial production of the
> impugned steel bars only in June 2017. No substantial sales have been
> effected pursuant to that. On the contrary, the plaintiff has pleaded sale
> of subject matter products since 2013; its total sale for the year 2016-2017
> was ` 8,377/- lacs. The total gross turnover of the plaintiff for the year
> 2016-2017 is ` 63,315/- lacs. The plaintiff has also shown that huge sum of
> money was spent on the advertisement of the subject matter. In 2016-2017, `
> 27,50,292/- was spent on advertisement expenses and ` 1,13,86,571/- was
> spent on sales promotion.
> 12\. The defendant has not placed on record any credible material at this

> the British Standard BS 4449:2005 category B500C. The plaintiff has placed
> on record the advertisement undertaken by the defendant for its products
> which is identical to the plaintiff's design. In this advertisement, the
> defendant claims that the design underneath the magnifying glass was its
> 'innovation'. Apparently, the defendant cannot plead at this juncture that
> the impugned design of which the plaintiff is the registered proprietor was
> in public domain prior to 2013.
> 13\. The plaintiff has produced on record a report from Standard Testing
> Laboratory (page 245, part III); it records that the sample described TMT 10
> mm "FRIENDS" did not conform to IS : 1786-08 for GR-Fe-500 with test No. 3,

> 309/2017 Page 5 of 18 Rajesh Kant Chand Mishra, Assistant Professor observed
> : "on the basis of various comparisons as studied and discussed in above
> paragraphs on support of aforesaid figures and facts of this report, it has
> been concluded herein that the design in FRIENDS' TMT Bars is the copy of
> the design in KAMDHENU's TMT Bars."
> 14\. The plaintiff has also placed on record the document showing that one

> 'M/s. Kamdhenu Ltd. vs. M/s. Him Steel Private Limited' dated 14.12.2016."
8\. Mr. Rajshekar Rao, learned counsel for Aashiana, urges that the impugned
order is in clear error in concluding that the prima facie strength of the
plaintiff‟s case has been established. He emphasized that registration of a
design merely endorses that the applicant‟s claim to novelty was established
before the registering agency, i.e the FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 6 of 18
controller. That registration, however, at best was a rebuttable presumption
of novelty. Urging this court to vacate the impugned order, Mr. Rao stated
that Kamdhenu copied the design from the British Standard BS 4449:2005
(category B500C) freely available in the public domain. It was published in
2005. He also stated that the design is functional in nature and is not a
registrable design under Section 19(1)(d) of the Act. Aashiana was in the
process of filing a cancellation petition at the stage of the impugned order.
He highlighted that it was only in the replication, that the plaintiff stated
that the ribs were inclined 480 and 650. This too, according to Mr. Rao, did
not lead to any inference of novelty. As a part of the standards which
indicated a range within which the ribs of such bars could be manufactured,
the manufacture and sale of the range which the plaintiff had chosen to
produce could not ipso facto lead one to conclude that Aashiana indulged in
infringement.
9\. It is argued that the impugned design registration is invalid because of
numerous prior publications placed on record for more than 30 years prior to
the date of Kamdhenu's registration. It is stated that the impugned design is
an Industry Standard for reinforcement bars since 1984, prescribed by various
countries/organizations around the world such as Germany, Poland, ISO, etc.
and is thus in the public domain. Counsel stated that the surface pattern on
the impugned design is functional as it is imprinted for identification of a
specific Steel Grade by all TMT bars manufacturers and is part of an industry
practice. Terming Kamdhenu‟s claim to be the originator/creator of FAO(OS)
309/2017 Page 7 of 18 the impugned design as false, it was submitted that the
plaintiff replicated the British Standard BS 4449:2005 category B500C design
and several other Industry Standards. He also submitted that the impugned
design registration does not claim any angle of the transverse ribs and thus
irrespective of which angles are used by Aashiana the impugned design is
invalid by reason of prior publication. Counsel highlighted that the plaintiff
concealed from the court the fact that impugned design has been in the public
domain since as early as 1984 and therefore it cannot claim monopoly over it.
Mr. Rao elaborated that the impugned design/surface pattern is also functional
inasmuch as the surface pattern enables the TMT bar to grip the concrete used
for reinforcing concrete structures and thus, not registrable as a Design
under Section 2(d) of the Designs Act, 2000.
10\. In fact, the sole purpose of this Act is protection of the intellectual
property right of the original design for a period of ten years or whatever
further period extendable. The object behind this enactment is to benefit the
person for his research and labour put in by him to evolve the new and
original design. This is the sole aim of enacting this Act. It has also laid
down that if design is not new or original or published previously then such
design should not be registered. It further lays down that if it has been
disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any other country by
publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the filing
date, or where applicable, the priority date of the application for
registration then such design will not be registered or if it is found that it
is not FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 8 of 18 significantly distinguishable from known
designs or combination of known designs, then such designs shall not be
registered. It also provides that registration can be cancelled under Section
19 of the Act if proper application is filed before the competent authority
i.e. the Controller that the design has been previously registered in India or
published in India or in any other country prior to the date of registration,
or that the design is not a new or original design or that the design is not
registerable under this Act or that it is not a design as defined in Section 2
(d) of the Act. Counsel relied on Bharat Glass Tube Limited vs. Gopal Glass
Works Ltd. 2008 (10) SCC 657; Reckitt Benckiser India Ltd. v. Wyeth Ltd. AIR
2013 Delhi 101 (FB); and Dart Industries Inc. And Another v. Techno Plast &
Ors 2007 (35) PTC 129 (Del).
11\. Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned senior counsel for Kamdhenu, urged this court
not to interfere with a reasoned, discretionary order injuncting pendente
lite, the appellant Aashiana from using the design used by it for the iron
bars, sold in the market by it, for which the plaintiff (Kamdhenu) is the
registered owner. Counsel relied on Wander limited v. Antox India (Pvt.)
Limited 1990 (Supp) SCC 727 and urged that this court should desist from
setting aside a reasoned interim order in a pending suit.
12\. On the other aspects, urged on behalf of Kamdhenu, Mr. Sibal submitted
that Kamdhenu‟s registered design is new, novel and original. After applying
for registration of the said design, it took steps for its effective use and
publication. Kamdhenu is using the registered FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 9 of 18
design on its KAMDHENU SS 10000 TMT which is best quality steel bar. After
getting the Test Certificates from IIT Roorkee and Guru Nanak Dev Engineering
College, Punjab, Kamdhenu actively launched KAMDHENU SS 10000 TMT bar bearing
the said Design in the market on June 18, 2013. It was emphasized that
representation of KAMDHENU SS 10000 TMT bar bearing the said design is
distinctive and the defendant/Aashiana‟s use of an identical magnifying glass
to highlight sections of the bar, betrays its intent to copy Kamdhenu‟s
product and represent it as its own.
13\. Mr. Sibal, learned senior advocate argued that the KAMDHENU design is not
identical to any design available in the public domain; he has asserted that
in fact it is new and original. It was submitted that the Aashiana‟s
allegations with respect to fraudulent and dishonest adoption, of the design
is baseless. Elaborating, it is urged that the plaintiff‟s subject design is
quite distinct from the designs and standards that Aashiana relies upon.
Emphasizing that essentially what Aashiana did was to merely imitate the two
sets of ribs at the identical incline i.e. 48 0 - which is not mentioned
specifically in any standard, it in effect indulged in infringement. Learned
senior counsel also highlighted that the exact reflection of the distinctive
magnifying glass design and the striking similarity between the two products
in their visual representation leads one to conclude that Aashiana blatantly
imitated the plaintiff/KAMDHENU products and the resultant confusion would
inevitably be at the economic expenses of KAMDHENU. Learned FAO(OS) 309/2017
Page 10 of 18 counsel also submitted that since Aashiana traded only in
Gujarat and has not substantiated its submission with respect to the existence
of any market, the balance of convenience was with the plaintiff and was
correctly held as such by the learned Single Judge.
14\. It is argued further that Aashiana‟s submission that the plaintiff‟s
design could not be registered because it related to functionality, is
unacceptable. Learned counsel relied upon Mohan Lal, Proprietor of Mourya
Industries vs. Sona Paint & Hardwares, 2013 (55) PTC 61 (Del) (FB) and
Whirlpool of India Ltd. vs. Videocon Industries Ltd., 2014 (60) PTC 155 (Bom).
It was emphasized that in order for the defence of functionality to succeed,
the design applied for has to be the only mode or option available given the
functional requirement and inherit limitation of the article or the product.
It was submitted that the courts have recognized that there may be cases where
the design while fulfilling the novelty standard is also functional. In such
cases, the complexity is resolved by noting that the function can be performed
by another shape as well, without in any manner defeating the novelty claimed.
Analysis and Conclusions
15\. The above discussion would reveal that the appellant/ Aashiana
essentially urges that the product i.e., Steel Rods (used in the construction
industry) over which Kamdhenu predominantly claimed and was granted design
registration on 29.08.2014 is neither unique nor novel and that rather it is a
mere reproduction of a standard design FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 11 of 18 that has
been in the public domain since 1984. It is also brought to notice that the
question of imitation of the technical and the so called reproduction of the
inclines of transverse ribs (i.e. rib pattern) was never highlighted. Aashiana
also complains that Kamdhenu suppressed the relevant facts relating to the
applicable standards.
16\. Aashiana, the defendant has relied upon several documents, which were
part of the record before the learned Single Judge, which suggests the angular
arrangement of ribs within the particular range. These standards were revised
in 2005 (evident from British Standards BS 4449:2005). Aashiana relies upon
Figure 4 i.e. an example of rib pattern of Grade B-50 C. The relevant extract
of the concerned rib patterns (including figures 2, 3 and 4) are as follows:
B500B consists of two or more series of parallel transverse ribs and each
series is at a contrary angle to the others. The BIS reproduced them as
illustrations in the following terms:
FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 12 of 18
B500C consists of transverse ribs in the pattern of series as defined in B500B
but the transverse ribs are arranged in an angle to each other as illustrated
below:
17\. Aashiana has produced similar standards (International standards - ISO
6935-2:2007 (E) which deals with similar ribbed bars/rods. Likewise, Turkish
and Polish standards have been relied upon. Aashiana‟s arguments in this
regard are that these standards have been in existence and pre-date the claim
of novelty put forward by Kamdhenu. In this regard, it relies upon certain
decisions, notably; Bharat Glass Limited Tube Limited vs. Gopal Glass Works
Ltd., AIR 2008 SC 2520, which emphasized that if a design is not new or
original or has been previously published, then it should not be registered.
The judgment of this court in Niky Tasha India (P) Ltd vs. Faridabad Gadget
Pvt. Ltd., AIR 1985 Del 136 has ruled that registration of a design is only "a
prima facie evidence" of proprietorship and novelty. Likewise, as to what
constitutes novelty - in the context of previous publication or previously
used articles-was dealt with in B. Chawla and sons vs. Bright Auto Industries,
AIR 1981 FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 13 of 18 Del 95. The court held that little
variation in products which existed such as adding a curve here or there in
the shape of a well recognized shape of an article of common use in the market
does not make it a new or original design.
18\. Paras 3-97, 3-98 and 3-99 of Russell-Clarke and Howe on Industrial
Designs (Seventh Edition Sweet & Maxwell) which dealt with what constitutes
prior publication reads as follows:
> "3-97 What counts as "published" for the purpose of calling into question
> the novelty of a later design registration? This is broader than the word at
> first suggests. It by no means limited to the publishing of a design in a
> printed publication, although it includes that. In practical terms, there
> are two main ways in which a design can be published: by prior use of the
> design, by selling or displaying to the public articles to which the design
> has been applied; and by paper publications of one sort or another. It is
> not, in fact, necessary that publication should be on paper; an oral
> disclosure, provided it is non-confidential, will amount to publication.
> 3-98 In general, the law as to what constitutes a prior publication for
> registered design purposes is that same as the law of prior publication
> under the pre-1977 patent authorities on the subject have consistently been
> treated as applicable to registered design cases. 3-99 In order to be relied
> upon for the purpose of attacking the novelty of a pre-2001 design
> registration, the publication concerned must be within the United Kingdom.
> This limitation has important practical consequences."
FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 14 of 18
19\. In the present case, the suit nowhere discloses - nor does the plaintiff/
Kamdhenu appear to have stated in its pleadings or in the documents filed
before the court that the rods/ bars for which the registration was sought
conformed to any particular standard at all. It is a matter of record that
Aashiana averred to that the standard universally accepted and applied
routinely by all manufacturers of the product had existed for almost three
decades. It relied upon the last British Standards published in 2005,
especially B500C. B500 C refers to B500 B (Figure 3). B500B while adverting to
B500A states that the bars would have two or more parallel transverse ribs. It
thus, states that for bars with two or three rib series "one of the series
shall be contrary angle to the other and for bars with 4 ribs series, two of
the series shall be at contrary angle". The B500C standard states that the
bars for this particular standard would have the same arrangement of rib
series as for B500B and then provides that "Further in each rib series, the
ribs shall alternate between a higher and lower angle with respect to the bar
excess. The difference between the angles of the different ribs and the bar
excess shall be at least 100".
20\. During the submissions, it was pointed out by Aashiana that the bars
necessarily had to be diagonal by at least 450 or more else that would end up
as parallel rib patterns and not serve the purpose intended. If that is taken
into account, the standard indicates a limited range of possibilities for the
ribbing of the bars. For instance, if a ribbing at one surface is at 500, the
other would have to be at least at
600\. In this range, thus, there are limited options available to the FAO(OS)
309/2017 Page 15 of 18 manufacturer. Furthermore, these ribs would necessarily
have to reflect a familiar pattern that the customers would choose, having
regard to the peculiarity of the product. In these circumstances, the
arguments that its adoption of 480 and 650 for the two transverse ribbing
patterns, were unique and cannot be accepted. They merely reflected common
standards - available in the public domain and applicable to the concerned
product i.e. bars. As regards the contention that even though the products
conformed to a known standard, they satisfied the test of novelty and
uniqueness, is concerned, prima facie, this court is unpersuaded by the
plaintiff‟s contention. The design (i.e. set of transverse ribs) is a part of
known standards that are applicable and accepted by the industry and the
manufacturers are familiar with this. Moreover, the range of possibilities,
i.e the limits of angularity of the ribs (given they are to be transverse and
at least 100 apart) restrict the choices to an even greater extent. In these
circumstances, this court holds that despite functionality, no distinct
feature that can claim novelty was revealed, deserving design registration.
This observation is prima facie and meant for the purpose of this judgment;
all rights of parties to deal with it in the suit, are kept open.
21\. The learned Single Judge, with respect to this, completely overlooked
these salient aspects. In other words, a commonly applicable standard
available in the public domain, used by the plaintiff - Kamdhenu to claim
monopoly registration right, could not have been suppressed from the court or
from the Controller. The FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 16 of 18 registration of the
design thus was suspect. This court does not wish to say anything further
given that proceedings for cancellation of the registration are said to have
been taken out.
22\. As far as the visual representation of the product (use of magnifying
glass device) is concerned, this court notices that Kamdhenu‟s suit is
predicated on design infringement. It does not urge passing off nor claims any
relief in that regard. Likewise, the fact that Aashiana or someone connected
with it was an ex-licensee of the plaintiff, cannot in any manner be a
material factor to grant injunction since issues in respect of confidentiality
do not appear to have been pleaded. Likewise, the allegation that a particular
manufacturer who performed job work for Kamdhenu did so for Aashiana, is also
of no relevance.
23\. The only issue that the learned Single Judge dwelt upon and pronounced to
be the basis of the plaintiff‟s prima facie strength, on the merits of the
case, was that of infringement based upon registration. Given that the
relevant and material circumstances with respect to prior publication were not
taken into account and analysed in the proper perspective, this court is of
the opinion that the observations with respect to the existence of prima facie
case cannot be upheld. They are hereby set aside.
24\. In view of the above findings, the I.A. No. 12872/2017 in CS (OS)
No.360/2017 is dismissed and the impugned order thereby FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page

relief in that regard. Likewise, the fact that Aashiana or someone connected
with it was an ex-licensee of the plaintiff, cannot in any manner be a
material factor to grant injunction since issues in respect of confidentiality

questioning the temporary ad-interim injunction issued by the learned Single
Judge on 03.11.2017, in a suit by the plaintiff/respondent (hereafter
"Kamdhenu"). Kamdhenu alleged that Aashiana had infringed its registered
design in the sale of the latter‟s FRIENDS 500 HD steel bars. Aashiana
contended that Kamdhenu could not establish its registered design prima facie
to be novel and FAO(OS) 309/2017 Page 1 of 18 exclusive from the record so as
to justify the impugned ad interim temporary injunction.
2\. Briefly, the case set up in the suit is that the plaintiff manufactures
and markets steel bars and other allied goods under the name and trademark,
Kamdhenu®. It also claimed that to distinguish its TMT bars from the other
bars in the market, it developed a unique design with new and original
features of surface pattern, comprising of double ribs applied to 16 bars.
This development took place in 2012. Kamdhenu applied for registration under
the Designs Act, 2000; its claim was accepted, and the registration was
granted in Class 25-01 with effect from 14.01.2013, by certificate issued on
predicated on design infringement. It does not urge passing off nor claims any
relief in that regard. Likewise, the fact that Aashiana or someone connected
