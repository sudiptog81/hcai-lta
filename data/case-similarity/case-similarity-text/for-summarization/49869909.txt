    PER S. RIFAUR RAHMAN, A.M.:
This Miscellaneous Application is filed by the assessee u/s 254(2) of the
Income Tax Act seeking rectification/modification of the order of the Tribunal
dated 18/04/2019 in ITA No. 2010/Hyd/2017.
2\. In the M.A., the assessee stated as under:
> T his Miscellaneous application is filed against the order of Hon'ble Income
> Tax Appellate Tribunal, 'A' Bench, Hyderabad dt. 18.04.2019 vide ITA No.
> 2010/Hyd/2017, seeking rectification on the following submissions.
> 1\. In the appeal referred above, the appellant raised the following
> grounds:
> "1. The Learned (Ld) Dispute resolutions panel (DRP)/ Assessing Officer (AO)
> are erroneous in law and on the facts of the case.
2
> M.A. No. 58/Hyd/19 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
2\. The Ld. DRP/ Ld AO ought to have accepted the profit margin (DP/DC) of
6.27% adopted by the appellant as having complied with the arm's length
principle.
3\. The Ld DRP/AO are not justified in law in considering wrong comparables
and consequently arriving at an arm's length margin of 24.11% after making
Working capital adjustment of 1.39% and thereby making an adjustment of Rs.
2,75,04,986/ -.
4\. The AD erred in not giving full effect to the directions of Ld. DRP in
respect of excluding the company Wipro Limited (Seg) as a comparable company
in computation of operating margin of comparable companies, which resulted in
increase of margin by 0.33% (i.e. 24.11% less 23.78%) and thereby making an
excess adjustment of Rs.5,03,127/- (i.e. Rs.2,75,04,986/-less
Rs.2,70,01,859/-).
5\. The Ld. DRP/AO erred in not accepting assessee's contention of rejecting
the following 8 Companies inter alia on the grounds of High Turnover,
Functional Dis -similarity, ownership of intangible assets and non
-availability of segmental information relating to software development in
case of companies engaged in both software development and product
development.
    S.No.        Name of the Company
    1       Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd
    2       Bodhtree Ltd
    3       Celestial Biolabs Ltd
    4       Infosys Technologies Ltd
    5       LGS Global Ltd
    6       Persistent Systems Ltd
    7       Quintegra Solutions Ltd
    8       Softsollndia Limited
6\. The Ld DRP/ AO erred in confirming an adjustment when the appellant
company was claiming exemption u/s lOB and hence there is no intention to
shift profits outside India and more so when the tax rates in USA where the AE
is located, were higher than those prevailing in India.
7\. Any other ground that may be urged at the time of hearing with the prior
approval of the Hon'ble ITAT. Additional Grounds
1\. The Ld. TPO / DRP erred in computing/ confirming the margin of appellant
company by treating Fringe Benefit Tax("FBT") as an operating expense, which
resulted in reducing the margin of the Appellant company from 6.27% to 5.92%.
3
M.A. No. 58/Hyd/19 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
2\. The Ld TPO/ORP are not justified in law in considering FBT as an operating
expense in case of Appellant company as the Ld. TPO himself did not consider
the FBT as an operating expense while computing the margins of com parables. "
2\. The Hon'ble Income Appellate Tribunal disposed -off these grounds in its
order dated 18.04.2019 in ITA No.2010/Hyd/2017.
3\. The Hon'ble Income Appellate Tribunal in its order dated 18.04.2019 in ITA
No. 2010/Hyd/2017, in para 9.2, mentioned that the case 3DPLM Software
Solutions Ltd [2014] 42 taxmann.com 333 (Bangalore _ Trib.) cannot be relied
upon as it refers to AY 2007-08, the extract of the order is as under: "9.2
Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We find
that the Bangalore Tribunal in the case of 3DPLM software Solutions (supra)
direct the AO/TP O to exclude the said company by observing as under:
"9.5 Apart from relying on the afore cited judicial decisions in the matter
(supra), the assessee has brought on record substantial factual evidence to
establish that this company is functionally dis-similar and different from the
assessee in the case on hand and is therefore not comparable and also that the
findings rendered in the cited decisions for the earlier years i.e. Assessment
Year 2007-08 is applicable for this year also. We agree with the submissions
of the assessee that this company is functionally different from the assessee.
It has also been so held by co-ordinate benches of this Tribunal in the
assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007 -08 (supra) as well as in the
case of Triology E-Business Software India (P.) Ltd. (supra). In view of the
fact that the functional profile of and other parameters of this company have
not changed in this year under consideration, which fact has also been
demonstrated by the assessee, following the decision of the co-ordinate
benches of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007-08
in ITA No.845/Bang/2011 and Triology E -Business software India ,P. Ltd. case
(supra), we hold that this company ought to be omitted form the list of
comoarao. es. The AO/TPO are accordingly directed."
We notice that the decision of the ITAT, Bengaluru bench cannot be relied as
it refers to AY 2007 -08 and it is based on several other decisions. We notice
that similar to assessee, Celestial Bio Labs also offers several services to
its AEs and since we are determining with ALP based on TNMM, we consider the
average margin of all the several activities carried on by the assessee. On a
compartmentalizing two profit making companies with several activities, we can
co mpare the end  4 M.A. No. 58/Hyd/19 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
result, unless they are into product or highly diversified or some activities
which will modify the profit making ability of the organization. In this case,
we do not see any reason to interfere with the selection process. Therefore,
the obje ction of the assessee to exclude the said company is hereby rejected.
4\. In the course of proceedings before the Honourable Tribunal the authorised
representative submitted that the company Celestial Biolabs Ltd. is engaged in
various R&D activities and also it was engaged in development of products in
the field of bio-technology, pharmaceuticals etc. accordingly it fails the
test of functional similarity.
5\. In this connection the authorized representative relied on the above case
law (3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd [2014J 42 taxmann.com 333 (Bangalore -
Trib.)) wherein the Hon'ble ITAT after considering the rival contentions held
that the company Celestial Biolabs Ltd is not comparable to the Assessee
company as it is fails the test of functional similarit y. Further the Hon'ble
ITAT also held that in view of the fact that the functional profile of and
other parameters of Celestial Biolabs Ltd have not changed in this year under
consideration, which fact has also been demonstrated by the assessee,
following the decision of the co-ordinate benches of the Tribunal in the
assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007 -08 in ITA No.845/Bang/2011 the
Hon'ble ITAT directed the Ld. TPO to exclude the company (Celestial Biolabs
Ltd) as a comparable for AY 2008-09.
6\. Therefore, in the above case the Hon'ble Bengaluru bench has clearly
demonstrated that functional profile and other parameters are not changed in
the year under consideration which is A.Y 2008-09, and accordingly excluded
the same as a comparable in AY 2008-09.
7\. Further, we would like to humbly submit that the Hon'ble ITAT observed in
Para 9 of the order as follows: II As regards Celestial Biolabs Ltd., Id. AR
submitted that this company cannot be a comparable to the assessee company as
it is engaged in R&D activities and renders services to specific sectors. It
provides contract research services and is also diversified into marketing and
manufacturing activities. It is functionally different from the assessee
company, thus, it has to be excluded from the final list of comparables. He
relied on the following case:
1\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Vs. D CIT [2014J 42 Taxmann.com 333 (Bangalore -
Trib.)"
5
M.A. No. 58/Hyd/19 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
whereas the appellant company in its written submission filed before Hon'ble
bench relied not only on 3DPLM Software Solutions (Supra) but also on list of
case law decided in this context excluding "Celestial Biolabs Limited " as a
comparable on account of functional dissimilarity, vide page no.19 of the
written submissions.
For the sake of ready reference the same are extracted below: • Ketera
Software India {P.)Ltd. [2017J 79 taxmann.com 183 (Bangalore - Trib.) • AMD
India (P.) Ltd [2015J 61 taxmann.com 35 (Banga lore - Trib.) • GXS India
Technoloqy Centre (P.) Ltd. [2015] 62 taxmann.com 276 (Bangalore - Trib.) •
Actiance India (P.) Ltd. [2015J 59 taxmann.com 72 (Banga lore

Trib.) • UCB India (P.) Ltd. [2016] 73 taxmann.com 389 (Mumbai - Trib.)
8\. However, Hon'ble ITAT mentioned that "We notice that the decision of the
ITAT Bengaluru bench cannot be relied as it refers to AY 2007-08" which is
factually incorrect, as Hon'ble Bengaluru ITAT in the case of 3DPLM (supra),
which is also into software development services, excluded Celestial Biolabs
Ltd for AY 2008-09 very much on the basis of exclusion of the same in earlier
year i.e. AY 2007-08 and also on the basis of same profile being maintained
for AY 2008 -09, which clearly demonstrate the said company is functionally
dissimilar.
9\. It is therefore humbly submitted that the re is a mistake apparent from
the record in the order of the Hon'ble ITAT to this extent and hence it is
prayed that the Hon'ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal be pleased to rectify
the above mistake by passing appropriate order."
6
M.A. No. 58/Hyd/19 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
2.1 The ld. AR of the assessee referring to the above factual background,
requested the Bench to rectify the above mistake by passing appropriate order.
3\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, submitted that the Hon'ble Bench has
already considered this issue and applied its mind to come to a decision. As
regards the mistake of mentioning of AY as 2007 -08 instead of AY 2008-09, it
may be rectified. However, the conclusion arrived at by the Bench is proper
and there is no mistake apparent on record, it will amount to review of order
an d bench has given a clear finding. He relied on the following cases:
> 1\. PCIT Vs. Softbrands India (P) Ltd., 406 ITR 513 (Kar.)
> 2\. PCIT Vs. TIBCO Software(India) Pvt. Ltd., IT Appeal No. 522 of 2016,
> dated 24/09/2018. (Bombay High Court).
4\. In the rejoinder, the AR submitted that TIBCO Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) order may be distinguishable because there is a question of law before
the Hon'ble High Court, but, here we are arguing before the ITAT on factual
matter. He submitted that B ench may remand the matter to TPO to appreciate
the facts on record.
5\. Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. As
per the order, in para 9.2, we wrongly referred AY as 2007 - 08, whereas the
order was for AY 2008 -09, therefore, the AY may be read as 2008-09 instead of
2007-08. The modified para is as under:
> "We notice that the decision of the ITAT Bengaluru bench cannot be relied as
> it refers to AY 2008 -09 and it is based on several other decisions. We
> notice that similar to ass essee, Celestial Bio Labs also offers several

> activities which will modify the profit making ability of the organization.
> In this case, we do not see any reason to interfere with the selection
> process. Therefore, the objection of the assessee to exclude the said
> company is hereby rejected.
5.1 With regard to other submissions of the assessee, we have considered the
decision of ITAT, Bengaluru Bench and other orders referred by the assessee
and gave our findings considering the factual matrix. We are in agreement with
the submissions of the ld. DR that bench has already applied the mind and came
to the conclusion in the order. He submitted that the comparative analysis is
part of determining ALP and is final with a quietus at the hands of the final
fact finding authorities, bench has given clear cut findings. Therefore, the
Bench came to the conclusion after considering all the facts and not inclined
to review our decision as the ITAT h as no power to review its own order u/s
