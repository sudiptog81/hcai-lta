PER N.K. PRADHAN, AM This is an appeal filed by the assessee. The relevant
assessment year is 2011-12. The appeal is directed against the order u/s
143(3) r.w.s. 144C(13) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the 'Act') passed by the
Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Ward-11(2)(1), Mumbai (hereinafter 'AO') in
pursuance of the directions issued by the Dispute Resolution Panel (in short
'DRP').
M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 2 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016
2\. Briefly stated, the facts are that the appellant-company is wholly owned
subsidiary of Sitel Operating Corporation (USA) providing Information
Technology Enabled Services comprising of Contact/Call Centre Services.
The Ld. counsels of the assessee submit that the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th grounds of
appeal are general in nature. Also it is submitted by them that the 3rd, 4th,
5th grounds of appeal are not pressed.
The Ld. counsels further submit that the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 16th,
18th and 19th ground of appeal will be academic in nature in view of specific
directions in 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th ground of appeal. Therefore, we turn
to the 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th ground of appeal.
3\. The 13th ground of appeal The AO erred in considering Accentia
Technologies Ltd. as comparable to the assessee for benchmarking its
international transaction of provision of IT enabled services, disregarding
the fact that the company is functionally different from the assessee i.e. it
is engaged in provision of software services and operates under peculiar
circumstances.
3.1 The Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) has included Accentia Technologies Ltd.
('Accentia') in the final set of comparable on the ground that the company is
a BPO and is into healthcare receivable management. The Ld. counsels of the
assessee submit that Accentia is engaged in software development and Knowledge
Process Outsourcing ('KPO') services in the nature of healthcare revenue cycle
management and legal process outsourcing services. However, no separate
segmental information is available for the software development and healthcare
services provided by the company. Thus it is stated that in M/s Sitel India
Pvt. Ltd. 3 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 the absence of separate segmental
information, Accentia has to be rejected as a comparable.
The Ld. counsels submit that in the following orders of the Tribunal, Accentia
is rejected as a comparable:
> (i) M/s Sitel Operating Corporation India Pvt. Ltd. (since amalgamated with
> Sitel India Pvt. Ltd.) v. ITO (ITA No. 598/Bang/2015 & ITA No.

> (iii) PCIT v. PTC Software (I) (P.) Ltd. (IT Appeal No. 598 of 2016) dated
> 16 April 2018 [AY 2009-10] (Bom HC) 3.2 On the other hand, the Ld. DR
> submits that the TPO/AO has rightly included Accentia. in the final set of
> comparables.
> 3.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant materials
> on record. The reasons for our decisions are given below.
In this context, we would be referring to the relevant pages of the Paper Book
(P/B), which was also filed before the TPO. The annual report of Accentia
clearly indicates that it is engaged in the provision of software services. As
per the CEO's letter to shareholders on page 6 of the annual report, it is
engaged in providing software development services and is using SaaS delivery
model. Further, from page 31 of the annual report, it can be seen that the
company is also engaged in sale of software products, for which no segmental
breakup is available. As per the 'Management Discussion Analysis' on page 25
of the annual report, the company is engaged in software development as it has
SaaS model, which is further explained on pages 28 and 30 of the annual
report. Further, the company has also developed software solutions such as
'Instakare' and 'Insta PMS' which helps healthcare providers with a holistic
and comprehensive solutions that fulfils all the medical and administrative
support needs. In the absence of segmental financial information for software
development product sales (which would form part of income earned from medical
transcription) the company cannot be considered as a comparable.
M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 5 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 In appellant's own case for
AY 2010-11 (ITA (TP)A No. 598/Bang/2015) the ITAT 'A' Bench, Bangalore vide
order dated 25.04.2018 at para 13.4 held as under:
> "13.4 We heard rival submissions and perused the material on record. The

3.4 Facts being identical, we follow the above order of the Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the immediate preceding assessment year and direct the
TPO/AO to delete Accentia Technologies Ltd. from the final list of
comparables.
Thus the 13th ground of appeal is allowed.
4\. The 14th ground of appeal The AO erred in considering Acropetal
Technologies Ltd. (Seg). as comparable to the assessee for benchmarking its
international transaction of provision of IT enabled services, disregarding
the fact that the company is functionally different from the assessee i.e. it
is engaged into Knowledge Process Outsourcing Services.
4.1 The TPO/AO included Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg) (in short
'Acropetal') in the final set of comparables on the ground that the company is
engaged in providing similar activity (IT Enabled Services ) and as per
Notification No. 11521 issued by CBDT, there is no distinction between BPO and
KPO.
4.2 The Ld. counsels of the assessee submit that Acropetal is engaged in
providing KPO services. Explaining that TPO has considered 'Engineering Design
Services' segment of Acropetal as comparable to M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 7
ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 the assessee, it is argued that the above segment of the
company is in the nature of KPO and is functionally not comparable to the ITeS
services performed by the appellant.
In this regard, the Ld. counsels rely on the following orders of the Tribunal
:
> (i) M/s Sitel Operating Corporation India Pvt. Ltd. (since amalgamated with
> Sitel India Pvt. Ltd.) v. ITO (ITA No. 598/Bang/2015 & ITA No.
> 452/Bang/2015) dated 25 April 2018 [AY 2010-11)
> (ii) Goldman Sachs (India) Securities (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT (IT Appeal (TP) Nos
> 902 & 927 (Mum) of 2016) dated 11 January 2017 [AY 2011-12) (Mum ITAT)
> (iii) DCIT v. M/s Infor(India) Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No. 113/Hyd/2016) dated 7 July
> 2017 [AY 2011-12]
> (iv) e4e Business Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (ITA No. 1397/Bang/2016)
> dated 13 January 2017 [AY 2011-12],
> (v) M/s Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT(IT(TP)A No.
> 191/Bang/2015) dated 25 January 2017 [AY 2010-11].
4.3 On the other hand, the Ld. DR supports the order passed by the TPO/AO on
the ground that Acropetal is engaged in providing similar activity (IT Enabled
Services).
4.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant materials on
record. The reasons for our decisions are given below.
As per page 8 of the annual report, Acropetal includes services such as design
engineering, architectural, structural services. These services are in the
nature of a KPO services as defined in Safe Harbour Rules.
M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 8 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 Further, Acropetal operates
various services such as architectural, structural, electrical engineering
etc. which are functionally different from the ITeS rendered by the appellant.
Regarding the reliance placed by the TPO and DRP on Notification No. 11521
issued by CBDT, we find that it is in relation to the type of information
technology enabled products or services which will be eligible for deduction
u/s 10A(b)(i)(2), section 10B(b)(i)(2) and section 80HHE(b). The purpose of
the said Circular is entirely different viz. to state the type of services
which are eligible for deduction.
We find that the Safe Harbour Rules issued by CBDT clearly demarcates between
BPO and KPO services and has also provided separate Safe Harbour Margin for
these type of services.
4.4.1 In appellant's own case for AY 2010-11 (ITA (TP)A No. 598/Bang/2015) the
ITAT 'A' Bench, Bangalore vide order dated 25.04.2018 at para 14.4 held as
under:
> "14.4 We heard rival submissions and perused the material on record. The
> issue of comparability of this company was considered by the co-ordinate
> bench of Tribunal in the case of M/s.Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt.
> Ltd. in IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2015 dated 25/01/2017 wherein it has been held:
> "13. As regards Accentia Technologies Ltd. and ICRA Online Ltd. this

> 1821/Mum/2016 and in support of his contention, he placed reliance on the
> Tribunal order rendered in the case of M/s. Flextronics Tech. (India) Pvt.
> Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.1559(B)/2012 dated 23.10.2015, copy available on

> c) Coral Hubs Ltd.
> d) Crossdomain Solutions Ltd.
> e) Eclerx Services Ltd.
> f) Genesys International Corpn. Ltd.
> g) Mold Tek Technologies Ltd."
We further note that the functional comparability has been examined in detail
by the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Equant Solutions
India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.1202/Del/2015 as well as in the case of
ITO Vs. Interwoven Software Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. in ITA
No.461/Bang/2015. Further in the case of Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg.),
the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Kodiak Networks (India)
Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.1540/Bang/2012 has considered the functional
comparability and found that this company is not comparable with a captive
service provider. Accordingly we direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude
these companies from set of comparables."
Respectfully following the decision of the co-ordinate bench of Tribunal, we
direct the AO/TPO to delete Acropetal Technologies Ltd.(Seg) from the list of
comparables."
M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 10 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 4.4.2 Facts being
identical, we follow the above order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case
for the immediate preceding assessment year and direct the TPO/AO to delete
Acropetal Technologies Ltd.(Seg) from the list of final comparables.
Thus the 14th ground of appeal is allowed.
5\. The 15th ground of appeal The AO erred in considering ICRA Online Ltd.
(Seg) as comparable to the assessee for benchmarking its international
transaction of provision of IT enabled services, disregarding the fact that
the company is functionally different from the assessee i.e. it is engaged
into knowledge Process Outsourcing Services.
The 17th ground of appeal The AO erred in computing the operating margin of
ICRA Online Limited (Seg) as 33.54% on operating costs as against the correct
margin of 22.32%.
5.1 The TPO included ICRA Online Ltd. (Seg) (in short 'ICRA')on the ground
that it is engaged in data processing and data mining and accordingly it is
providing similar services (ITeS). The DRP upholds the order of the TPO, which
is followed by the AO.
5.2 The Ld. counsels of the assessee submit that as per the annual report, the
company has following three business segments:
> (i) Information Services,
> (ii) Software Services and
> (iii) Outsource Services It is further stated that the TPO has considered
> the operations of the 'Outsourced Services' segment as comparable to the
> operations of M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 11 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 the
> appellant. The Ld. counsels argue that the annual report of the company does
> not provide any description as to the nature of the services contained in
> the segment. However, a reference may be drawn to the annual report of ICRA
> Ltd., the holding company of ICRA from where it can be seen that the
> outsourced segment of the company relates to KPO and online software
> services.
The Ld. counsels further submit that the ITAT in appellant's own case for AY
2010-11 has followed the Tribunal discussion in the case of Tesco Hindustan
Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (ITA No. 191/Bang/2015) to reject the company
functionally not comparable to the appellant i.e. companies not engaged in
providing ITeS (BPO Services). In this regard, reliance is placed by them on
the following orders of the Tribunal :
> (i) M/s Sitel Operating Corporation India Pvt. Ltd. (since amalgamated with
> Sitel India Pvt. Ltd.) v. ITO (ITA No. 598/Bang/2015 & ITA No.
> 452/Bang/2015) dated 25 April 2018 [AY 2010-11]
> (ii) M/s Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT(IT(TP)A No.
> 191/Bang/2015) dated 25 January 2017 [AY 2010-11]
> (iii) Outsource Partners International v. DCIT (IT(TP)A No. 337/Bang/2015)
> [AY 2010-11].
5.3 On the other hand, the Ld. DR submits that ICRA is engaged in data
processing and data mining and accordingly it is engaged in providing similar
services (ITeS). Thus it is stated that the inclusion of the above company by
the TPO/AO in the list of final comparables be confirmed.
M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 12 ITA No. 1821/Mum/2016 5.4 We have heard the rival
submissions and perused the relevant materials on record. The reasons for our
decisions are given below.
The TPO has considered the operations of the 'Outsourced Services' segment of
ICRA as comparable to the operations of the appellant. However, we find that
the annual report of the company does not provide any description as to the
nature of the services contained in this segment. As per page 532 of the P/B,
a reference may be made to the annual report of ICRA Ltd., the holding company
of ICRA from where it can be seen that the outsourced segment of the company
relates to KPO and online software services. Also page 8 of the annual report
of ICRA Ltd. delineates the business of ICRA stating that the company is
engaged in providing KPO and online software services. As per the description
at page 532 of the P/B, the knowledge process outsourcing division provides
financial and analytical services and support to clients in the area of data
extraction, aggregation, electronic conversion of financial statements,
validation and analysis, accounting and finance, research and analytics.
Thus the appellant in the instant case performs routine ITeS comprising of
contact/call centre services and hence is a routine BPO service provider and
cannot be compared to a company providing KPO services such as ICRA.
Also we find that the TPO has wrongly computed the margin of the company as
33.54% instead of the correct margin 22.32%, because the TPO has excluded
foreign exchange income and other receipts (allocated basis revenue in each
segment), whereas, the same is to be M/s Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. 13 ITA No.
1821/Mum/2016 added for information service, outsource service and software
service to arrive at the correct margin.
In assessee's own case for AY 2010-11, the ITAT 'A' Bench Bangalore has
followed the Tribunal discussion in the case of Tesco Hindustan Service Centre
Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to reject the companies functionally not comparable to the
appellant i.e. companies not engaged in providing ITeS (BPO) service. In the
case of Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. (supra), ICRA has been held
to be non-comparable to an ITeS service provider.
Accordingly, following the decision of Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) and the observations in the Tribunal decision in appellant's own
case for AY 2010-11, we reject ICRA Online as a comparable.
Thus the 15th & 17th grounds of appeal are allowed.
6\. As the 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th ground of appeal are allowed in favour of
the appellant, the 8th to 12th, 16th, 18th and 19th ground of appeal become
academic in nature.
The 20th ground of appeal stating "benefit of +/- 5% under proviso to section
92C(2) of the Act be granted to the assessee, if the adjustment under transfer
pricing falls within the range specified therein" becomes consequential in
nature.
The 21st ground of appeal regarding levy of interest u/s 234B, similarly
becomes consequential in nature.
The 22nd ground of appeal regarding initiation of penalty u/s 271(1)(c) is
premature.

is engaged in provision of software services and operates under peculiar
circumstances.
