JU DGMENT SUDHANSU JYOTI MUKHOPADHAYA, J M/s Atos Worldline India Pvt Limited
('Informant)' filed information under Section 19(1)(a) of the Competition Act,
2002 against M/s Verifone TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals
No.82 and 83 of 2015)  2 India Sales Pvt Ltd (Opposite Party No.1/Verifone
herein) and M/s Verifone System Inc (Opposite Party No.2) alleging
contravention of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act. The Commission
instituted it as Case No.56/2012.
2\. M/s Three D Integrated Solutions Ltd (another 'Informant') had also filed
information under Section 19(1)(a) of the Competition Act, 2002 against M/s
Verifone India Sales Pvt Ltd (Opposite party/appellant herein) inter alia
alleging contravention of provisions of Section 3 and 4 of the Act. It was
registered as Case No.13/2013.
Case of M/s Atos Worldline India Pvt Ltd
3\. The Informant, M/s Atos Worldline India Pvt Ltd is owned by Atos, a global
information technology services company operating in the areas of hi- tech
transactional services and system integration and management services. It was
informed that the Opposite Party No.1 i.e. appellant is leading supplier of
Point of Sale (hereinafter referred to as 'POS') Terminals in India having
control over nearly 70% to 80% of the market. It had acquired several other
players in the POS Terminal marketing in India such as Lipman Electronic India
Pvt Ltd in 2006, Hypercom India and Gemalto in 2011.
4\. It is stated that appellant supplies POS Terminals along with core POS
Terminal applications (i.e. Operating System and Kernels) and Software
Development Kits (hereinafter SDKs) to enable the basis functionality of the
POS Terminals. It is submitted that POS Terminals along with its core
applications are either sold directly to the customers like banks and retail
outlets or to the third party processor (TPPs) such as Informant who act on
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  3
behalf of acquiring banks and also render Value Added Services (VAS) to
develop and integrate applications into POS Terminals
5\. It is averred that for the provision of VAS, it is extremely important for
the Informant to have access to the core POS Terminal applications and their
crucial enhancements/updates along with SDKs. Withholding of such
enhancements/updates and SDKs by the POS Terminal manufacturers will
negatively impact the growth of the TPP and VAS markets. It is stated that as
per standards industry practice, core POS Terminal applications and SDKs are
provided alongwith the POS Terminals and the costs of the same are built into
the price paid for the POS Terminals.
6\. The Information stated that between September, 2010 and December, 2011,
the appellant continued to provide SDKs to the Informant alongwith the POS
Terminals and core terminal applications without any restrictions on the use
of SDKs. Appellant also used to provide training to the Informant's engineers
to enable the Informant to render VAS to its customers.
7\. The Informant stated that cost of core applications and SDKs were always
included in the purchase orders for the purchase of the POS Terminals. In
relation to enhancements and updates to core terminals applications, the
purchase orders contained clauses stipulating the terms and conditions. It is
stated that in practice such enhancements and updates were provided at no
extra cost, other than the price paid at the time of procurement of POS
Terminals.
8\. It is submitted that after acquisition of Venture Infotek by the Informant
in August, 2010, the appellant issued a termination letter to the Informant in
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  4
September, 2010 alleging breach of Source Code License Agreement (hereinafter,
SCLA) which was signed between them in July, 2009 for a particular model of a
POS Terminal. Informant stated that despite issue of the said termination
letter, the appellant continued to supply PO S Terminals along with its core
applications, SDKs and training to its engineers for the use of SDKs.
9\. It is averred that in January, 2012 the appellant sent a proposed draft
SDK agreement to the Informant stating that the same is not open to any
negotiations, amendments or changes and that the Informant has to insert
certain details in the said draft SDK agreement and to counter sign it. The
Informant alleged that through the said draft SDK agreement the appellant
sought to impose certain restrictive conditions on it.
10\. The Informant stated that the terms of the said draft SDK agreement and
the restrictions contained therein were a complete departure from the business
practice that had existed in the industry for several years. Moreover, no
legitimate business reasons were provided by the appellant to carry out such
drastic changes in the said draft SDK agreement. It is alleged that the
restrictions contained in the draft SDEK agreement foreclose the VAS market.
11\. The Informant averred that since early January, 2012, the appellant has
adopted a very unreasonable position and there was an unprecedented delay in
the supply of kernels which caused heavy revenue loss to it. It is alleged
that between January, 2012 and July, 2012, the appellant made repeated
attempts to force the Informant to agree to the terms and conditions as set
out in the draft SDK agreement. Further the appellant issued several
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  5
reminders to the Informant to complete the formality of signing the draft SDK
agreement, failing which the appellant threatened to withdraw the SDK support
for the Informant's business. It is averred that the Informant was constrained
to issue several letters to the appellant highlighting the unreasonable nature
of the restrictions set out in the draft SDK agreement. It is the case of the
Informant that despite repeated attempts to engage in constructive discussion
with the appellant on the restrictive conditions of the draft SDK agreement,
it issued a termination letter dated 01.08.2010.
12\. It is alleged in the information that the appellant over the past few
years also made in-roads into the VAS market and operates as a direct
competitor to the Informant and other entities operating in the VAS market. It
is alleged that on account of the appellant's dominant position in the POS
Terminals market and its presence in the VAS market, it resorted to the
conduct and practices which directly impair not only the ability of VAS
providers from operating in the market but appropriate the Informant's IPR in
the VAS market.
13\. It is alleged that at a global level the Informant and Verifone are
competitors in the provision of hardware and software solutions to the payment
industry. But, in India the Informant is operating in the TPP and VAS spheres
only whereas the appellant is not only dominant in the POS Terminals market
but also active in the VAS market where it primarily operates in the non-
financial applications and is now leveraging its strength to compete in the
financial services market.
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  6
14\. Citing RBI's Payment System Vision Document, 2012-156, the Informant
stated that in the POS Terminal manufacturing industry in India, Verifone and
Ingenico are the two prominent players. By virtue of being almost an exclusive
supplier of POS Terminals in India, the appellant exercises significant
control over the supply of hardware and software solutions.
15\. The Informant has also stated that there appears to be no objective
justification for imposing unreasonable and unfair terms in the draft SDK
agreement. These terms would effectively eliminate the Informant from the
downstream market and would support the appellant's interest by eliminating
competition in the market. The Informant has alleged that appellant by
imposing restrictions in the draft SDK agreement, is aiming to strengthen its
position in the VAS market.
16\. Based on the above submissions, the informant has alleged that the
appellant, through the 2012 draft SDK agreement, has sought to impose unfair
and unreasonable conditions and prices on the Informant which is in
contravention of 4(2)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act. The appellant by imposing
severally restrictive terms and conditions on the usage of SDKs and by
demanding payment of unfair prices for provision of service has sought to
limit and restrict provision of services and technical development in the
market which is contravention of section 4(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Act. IT is
also alleged that the appellant has sought to deny market access to VAS
providers in contravention of section 4(2)(c) of the Act. Further the
appellant allegedly TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82
and 83 of 2015)  7 intended to use its dominant position in POS Terminals
market to dominate VAS market in contravention of section 4(2)(e) of the Act.
17\. Based on the above submission, the Informant inter alia prayed to the
Commission to direct the appellant to cease and desist from indulging in
abusive conduct; discontinue from imposing unfair, restrictive and
discriminatory conditions in relation to use of SDKs and enhancements to core
applications; not to give effect to the 2012 Termination letter, impose
appropriate penalty on the appellant for abuse of dominant position and grant
such other reliefs as the Commission may deem appropriate in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
18\. The Commission referred the matter for investigation by Director General
(DG). After receipt of investigation report filed by the DG, notices to the
appellant was issued and the objections/replies from the appellant was
received in response to the DG Report. By impugned order dated 10th April,
2015 the Commission held that it has come to the conclusion that the conduct
of the appellant is abusive in terms of Section 4 of the Act. The Commission
is of the considered opinion that through the SDK agreement the appellant has
imposed unfair conditions on VAS/TPP service providers which is in
contravention of Section 4(2)(a)(a)(i) of the Act; restricted the provision of
VAS services as well as limited/restricted the technical and scientific
development of VAS services used in POS Terminals market in India which is in
contravention of Section 4(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Act. The Commission also
held that the conduct of the appellant with respect to seeking disclosure of
sensitive business information from the customer is the downstream market
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  8 in
order to enable to enter into the downstream market of VAS services in in
contravention of the provisions of Section 4(2)(e) of the Act.
19\. The Commission also directed the appellant (opposite party No.1) to cease
and desist from indulging in the activities which have been found to be in
contravention of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act and imposed penalty
under Section 27 of the Act at the rate of 5% of its turnover based on the
financial statements filed by the appellant herein i.e. Rs.4,48,40,236/- Case
of M/s Three D Integrated Solutions Ltd
20\. M/s Three D Integrated Solutions Ltd is engaged in the business of video
broadcasting, audio broadcasting. The appellant (Opposite Party No.1) is
wholly owned subsidiary of M/s Verifone System Inc headquartered in USA. It
has been engaged in the business of manufacturing, development and selling of
hardware and software solutions such as mobile Electronic Ticketing Machines
(hereinafter ETMs) Point of Sale (POS) terminals and related services and
expertise that enable electronic payment transactions at POS terminals.
21\. Informant stated that Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) Govt of India
launched a National Programme for Standardised Automatic Fare Collection
System (hereinafter AFCS) in eighty cities with a National Common Mobility
Card (hereinafter NCMC) for passengers. The MOUD award the project of
launching an all India common mobility card along with AFCS to UTI
Infrastructure Technology Services Ltd (UTIITSL) and its consortium partner
across India. UTIITSL floated a Request for Proposal for implementation of
Integrated Transport Management System (TIMS) with a TA(AT)(Competition)No.1
and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  9 NCMC for Jaipur City
Transport Services Ltd (JCTSL) in Jaipur. The said bid was awarded to M/s
Efkon India Pvt Ltd Hereinafter EFKON) who in turn sub- contracted to the
Informant for supply, installation and maintenance and handheld payment device
for mobile use with wireless connectivity, security certifications etc to be
used in buses for the aforesaid project.
22\. Informant had placed a purchase order dated 5.4.2012 for Rs, 45,00,342/-
with the appellant for the supply of 275 nos of Vx680 fully functional mobile
ETMs for ITMS project in the city of Jaipur. The appellant was required to
supply fully functional ETMs and relevant accessories on which the Informant
was supposed to load independent application software and operate from its
infrastructure. Informant alleged that the appellant was well aware of the
requirements, methodology, end use and the project plan for which ETMs were
procured but did not communicate to the Informant about any restrictive
conditions in its offer.
23\. After securing and accepting the purchase order dated 5.4.2012 the
appellant informed the Informant regarding the restrictive use of the ETMs
i.e. requirement of a Software Development Kit (SDK) to achieve full
functionality of ETMs. Informant alleged that the appellant, a major player in
the hardware market for ETMs, wanted to attain a similar position in the
market for software loaded in the ETMs. Informant alleged that such conduct of
the appellant clearly indicates its malicious intent and motive to circumvent
the Informant's business and sets the grounds for its monopolistic opportunity
in the nascent transportation automation sector. The Information alleged that
the appellant was under legal and moral obligation TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and
2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  10 to disclose the complete
material information regarding the device including the fact that the device
cannot work without purchasing its proprietary SDK before selling the same to
the Informant. Having no choice left, the Informant purchased the SDK from the
appellant for Rs.3,65,615/-
24\. Informant alleged that the appellant asked the Informant to sign a very
restrictive agreement with regard to the use of its SDK. Further the appellant
with an ulterior motive, set aside the internationally accepted norms for SDK
agreement and, in the garb of IPR protection, created an agreement with an
absolute restriction on the Informant's independence to conduct business.
Since the Informant was already running behind schedule and was under the
threat of penalties and even cancellation of order, it had no choice but to
sign the agreement with highly restrictive clauses. It is also alleged that
the appellant did not sign and return the copy of the said agreement to the
Informant.
25\. It is alleged that SDK which was delivered by the appellant on 30.6.2010
was locked by a security key i.e. File Signing Tools (hereinafter FST) which
was an integral part of SDK and that the appellant illegally withheld the
security key. Further the said SDK swas an incompatible version and not
appropriate for ETMs delivered and also some of the critical components were
also not supplied. It is stated that due to short supply and incompatible SDK,
the supplied ETMs became useless for the Informant and it was fully dependent
on the appellant for functioning of ETMs. This caused delay in the development
process and the Informant had to suffer not only in terms of monetary loss but
also in terms of reputation in the market. TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of
2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  11
26\. Informant alleged that by not delivering the FST on time, the appellant
restricted it from making use of ETMs. It is alleged that the intention of the
appellant was to delay the project so that the end users are frustrated
thereby projecting the informant in bad light. Further to achieve its malafide
intention, the appellant made flimsy excuses of protection of IPR for the SDKs
and also illegally started to inspect the software submitted by the Informant
to pilfer the business model of the Informant.
27\. Informant alleged that the appellant even approached the end user itself
i.e M/s Efkon on 17.8.2012, bypassing the Informant and made a commercial
offer on the basis of knowledge gained from pilferage of the Informant's
software given to the appellant for trial. The informant alleged that such
conduct fully confirmed the hidden motive, unfair trade practices and desire
of the appellant in creating step by step restrictions and delays leading to
the circumvention of the Informant and setting the ground for its monopolistic
control.
28\. Informant alleged that he had served two legal notices to the appellant
on 21.8.2012 and 29.09.2012 for its alleged wrong doings. However, the
appellant gave an evasive reply stating that the contentions in the notices
were frivolous, wrong, incorrect, mischievous and baseless.
29\. Informant also alleged that the appellant took undue advantage of its
dominant position in the market in view of the fact that the consumers were
completely dependent upon it and there was no choice with the consumers.
Informant alleged that the appellant has entered into an anti-competitive
agreement i.e. the exclusive supply agreement which has appreciable adverse
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  12
effect on competition in India and has the effect of restricting the dealing
in any goods other than those of the appellant and therefore, amounts to
violation of Section 3 of the Act.
30\. Informant, seeing the said abusive conduct of the appellant, prayed
before the Commission to cause an enquiry against the appellant for the
alleged contravention of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act, and direct the appellant
to cease and desist from abuse of its dominant position and to comply with its
purchase order dated 5.4.2012.
31\. The Commission after considering the material available on record and
having informed that prima facie case is made out, directed the Director
General (DG) to conduct investigation into the matter under Section 26(1) of
the Act. The DG had investigated the matter and submitted its report, on which
notices were issued to appellant herein/opposite party. The Commission, upon
hearing the parties and perusal of evidence arrived at the conclusion that the
licence restriction clause to "not use the licensed software to develop any
payment software that directly or indirectly interacts with any acquiring
bank" seems to be unfair and restrictive. The SDK license agreement of the
appellant does not allow a third party to write a payment application in India
which is contrary to the practice followed by the appellant elsewhere across
the globe as is evidenced from the statement made in its website i.e.
"Verifone offers a selection of developer tools and drivers to help
programmers design and develop efficient, professional payment applications
that complement our payment systems". Further, by restricting the development
of payment softwares for any payment association and not
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  13
disclosing the said clause to the large buyers in India who would require
customized payment softwares to run on the POS terminals bought by them, the
appellant has restricted the availability of substitutable payment solutions
thereby restricting the choice for the buyers. Thus, the restrictions imposed
by the appellant on development of payment software by the third parties
appear to be anti-competitive.
32\. The Commission observes that the clause relating to not license, sell or
otherwise transfer any software that the appellant develops using the licensed
software to any third party of SDK license agreements appears to be unfair,
limits/controls the provision of VAS services and limits/restricts the
technical and scientific development of VAS services used in POS terminals in
India.
33\. It is further observed that the license restriction clause relating to
disclosure mentioned in the SDK license agreement imposes three different
disclosure requirements namely; a) disclose to licensor from time to time the
activities relating to licensed software; b) what value added software it has
created; and c) what licensee intends to create using the licensed software.
It may be noted that the appellant is a POS terminal manufacturer and is also
engaged in the development of VAS applications. It appears that by way of
these restrictions, the appellant was trying to get access to confidential
commercial information from the VAS providers and to exploit the lucrative VAS
market. The requirement of prior disclosure to the appellant about the VAS
developed by the Informant amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the
Informant as well as limits the provision of VAS service. Further seeking
information on the VAS services which the Informant intends to develop is
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  14
likely to prejudice the business activities of the Informant as the appellant
is developing into a major competitor for the Informant in the VAS/TPP market
in India. Such restriction appears to restrict technical or scientific
development relating to VAS services for POS terminals in India. Since the
appellant is large player (in terms of market share of POS terminals managed
by banks in India) and it itself is a manufacturer of POS terminals, its
conduct with respect to seeking disclosure of sensitive business information
from its customers in the downstream market with a view to protect/enhance its
presence in the downstream market of VAS services is abusive in terms of
Section 4 of the Act.
34\. Based on the above analysis the Commission is in agreement with the DG
findings, comes to the conclusion that the conduct of the appellant is abusive
in terms of Section 4 of the Act. The Commission is of the considered opinion
that through the SDK agreement, the appellant has imposed unfair conditions on
the Informant which are in contravention of section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act;
restricted the provision of VAS services as well as limited/restricted the
technical and scientific development of VAS services used in POS terminals in
India which is contravention of Section 4(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Act and the
conduct of the appellant with respect to seeking disclosure of sensitive
business information from its customers in the downstream market in order to
enable it to protect the downstream market of VAS service is in contravention
of the provisions of Section 4(2)(e) of the Act.
35\. The Commission accordingly issued impugned order dated 10th April, 2015
under Section 27(b) of the Act and not imposed penalty but took lenient
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  15
view in imposing the penalty in view of the penalty imposed in the earlier
case as referred to above (Case No.56/2012) wherein penalty of
Rs.4,48,40,236/- has been imposed on the opposite party (appellant herein) at
the rate of 5% of its average turnover for the last three financial years.
36\. So far as individual liability of the officials of the appellant in terms
of provisions of Section 48 of the Act is concerned, the Commission directed
them to file their income statements/Income Tax Returns and decided to pass an
order separately in respect of them.
37\. It is in the aforesaid background both the cases were heard together and
disposed off by this common judgement.
38\. Learned counsel for the appellant, M/s Verifone India Sales P:vt Ltd,
almost made similar submission in both the appeals. In respect of Atos
Worldline India Pvt Ltd an additional plea was taken that the impugned
agreement was a draft agreement and its terms were being negotiated at the
time of filing of the complaint. However, we are not inclined to accept the
submission in view of the language of the agreement, which shows that the
Verifone practically asked the Atos Worldline India Pvt Ltd to sign on the
agreement within the dotted line of the Agreement.
39\. Once it is held that the appellant is a dominant player of POS Terminal
in the relevant market then asking Atos Worldline India Pvt Ltd to sign within
the dotted line of the agreement will also amount to abuse of dominant
position in violation of Section 4(2)(a)(i), 4(2(b)(i), 4(2)(b)(ii) and
4(2)(e) of the Act, 2002.
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  16
40\. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the relevant period to
be considered while assessing the relevant market and alleged dominance should
be 2012 onwards. According to him market for POS Terminals in India cannot be
held within relevant market. According to appellant the purpose of defining a
relevant market is to determine the competitive constraints on the enterprise
under investigation. Accordingly all reasonably foreseeable constraints, such
as, technologies at use elsewhere or imminently entering the market must be
included in the definition of the relevant market. It was submitted that as
all electronic payment devices perform the same function, with the same end
use, i.e. to process electronic payments at the merchant's location, the
relevant market should be considered as the "market for electronic payments in
India". However, without prejudice to the above, it was submitted that at the
very least, the relevant market should be defined as the market for POS and
mobile POS terminals in India.
41\. Section 2(t) and 19(7) of the Act provide that while defining the
relevant market, the Commission is required to consider the substitutability
between the various products based on factors such as end use,
characteristics, price and consumer preferences. It was submitted that Mobile-
POS terminals and POS terminals are virtually the same product, with similar
characteristics, price and intended use. Both devices are used to swipe the
user's card at the merchant's location to process payments, and the
methodology of functioning of both devices is also the same, from swiping of
the card to final processing of payments. Additionally, the stakeholders
involved for both devices (i.e. banks, TPPS and VAS providers) are largely the
same, and similar VAS can (and is) developed on both machines by VAS
developers. It was submitted TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old
Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  17 that the only discernible difference between
the two devices is that Mobile POS machines are more compact and portable in
nature than POS terminals. A diagrammatic representation of both products has
been enclosed.
42\. It was submitted that the Commission has altogether failed to consider
evidence on record which clearly establishes that owing to the similarity of
POS and Mobile POS terminals, consumers (including large banks such as SBI,
Axis Bank, Citibank and companies such as Reliance) treated POS and Mobile POS
as substitutable even in 2012. This was further corroborated by the PwC Report
on Electronic Payments Market in India, 2014.
43\. Counsel for the appellant submits that there is no analysis by the
Commission under Section 2(t) and 19(7). It was submitted that while defining
the relevant market, the Commission has not undertaken an analysis of any of
the factors provided under Sections 2(t) and 19(7) of the Competition Act (end
use, characteristics, price and consumer preferences). The Commission has
summarily agreed with the DG's Report, which had itself also not undertaken
any analysis of the relevant factors.
44\. Relying on the decision of this Appellate Tribunal in Hyundai Motor India
Pvt Vs. Competition Commission of India & Ors, Competition Appeal (AT)
No.06/2017, it was submitted that the aforesaid approach undertaken by the
Commission have been held to be incorrect. It was contended that Verifone is
not in a dominant position even in the narrow POS terminal market. Without
prejudice to the submission above that the relevant market should not be
considered as narrow as the market of POS terminals, it is submitted
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  18
that even in the narrow relevant market for POS terminals, Verifone is not in
a dominant position.
45\. According to counsel for the appellant that even during the relevant
period of 2012-13, Ingenico had a market share of 57% while Verifone had a
market share of only 40% in the market for POS terminals in India. Learned
counsel for the appellant submitted that these figures are from the Pwc
Report, which is based on Government data. Learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that the Commission has relied on incorrect market share figures in
its analysis, and has inflated Verifone's sales by (a) including all POS
terminals sold by Verifone since its inception, including those which were
defunct/non-functioning at the relevant time (b) including POS terminals sold
by Verifone competitors prior to them even being acquired by Verifone, and (c)
not considering data of certain select banks/TPPs who had procured more
terminals from Verifon's competitors demonstrating cherry picking of evidenced
and data. The patent errors in the computation had been highlighted to the
Commission. The Commission failed to consider and address these submissions.
46\. It was further submitted that the Commission and the DG have disregarded
the basis test of dominance provided under Explanation (a) to Section 4 of the
Act i.e. the ability to operate independently of competitive forces or affect
consumers/competitors in the relevant market in its favour. Verifone does not
have this ability as it is significantly constrained at two levels. Verifone
is dependent on banks for access to the market. Verifone is neither able to
access customers, nor will its terminals be functional without
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  19
connectivity to banks. Therefore, Verifone cannot act independently in the
market.
47\. Counsel submitted that due to their powerful position, banks impose
highly onerous terms in their commercial dealings with Verifone. Banks
typically adopt a two vendor policy, wherein they purchase POS terminals from
at least two vendors. Therefore, banks are not dependent on Verifone and most
banks deal with other players like Ingenico and during the investigation when
banks and TPPs were approached for their comments, banks/TPPs have stated that
they have not come across any abusive conduct by Verifone. However, the
Commission has altogether failed to consider this evidence on record and has
cherry picked the evidence it seeks to rely on.
48\. A TPP must certify the terminals before it can be sold to a bank. As Atos
is the largest TPP in India with ties to more than 15 banks, Verifone
significantly depends on Atos for their certification. Interestingly, Atos is
also one of the largest global POS vendor and had also started POS operations
in India at the relevant time. The dependence on Atos is evidenced by the fact
that Verifone is forced to accept unfair terms in its operations with Atos.
Atos charges an exorbitant price of 8 lakhs and is the only TPP to impose this
charge due to its dominant position in the market.
49\. Similar plea has been taken in the case of Three D Integrated Solutions
Ltd by the appellant. It is submitted that the relevant market in this case
cannot be held to be POS terminal in India as the supply of ETMs by Verifone
to Three D Integrated Solutions Ltd (Informant) does not relate to supply of
POS terminals by Verifone.
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  20
50\. The counsel for the appellant submitted that Jaipur RFP, which is central
to the present dispute, itself distinguished between ETMs and POS terminals
and treated them as separate products. Therefore, according to the learned
counsel for the appellant no reliance can be placed on the cost of Atos
Worldline India Pvt Ltd for determination of relevant market. Learned counsel
for the appellant submitted that POS terminals and ETMs being two different
products that serve different end users, have different characteristics and
different customers and producers. The products cannot be treated as
substitutable simply because Verifone uses the same basic hardware for both
the products.
51\. The Commission has dealt with the relevant market and noticed that the
Verifone uses the same hardware for both the products. The hardware is common,
it will be evident from the product itself, picture of it is re-produced
below::
52\. Learned counsel for the appellant produced and relied on other Verifone
terminals to compare with the Ingonic terminals. The other Verifone terminals
of recent days like mobile, is reproduced as under:- TA(AT)(Competition)No.1
and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  21
53\. In the present case we are concerned with instrument. In the said
instrument which is being produced by Verifone and the present company(Atos
Worldline India Pvt Ltd) purchase the instrument only from Verifone. The first
instrument, as shown above was available in the year 2012-13, the relevant
point of time. The second instrument which is like mobile as shown above has
come later on and cannot be taken into consideration to determine the dominant
position of the 2012-13. It is the Verifone which puts the first App in it and
if it is purchased by the Bank, it puts its own additional App therein. The DG
investigation in the case of Atos Wordline India Pvt Ltd is dated 20th March,
2014. The relevant period of investigation is between the year 2009-10 to
September, 2012.
54\. The relevant market of POS terminals has been found to be in India as the
instrument can be used as POS terminal for depositing the money or collecting
money through Card anywhere in India.
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  22
55\. The DG rightly held that new technology such as EasyTap or Mswipe cannot
be considered as substitute of the POS terminals. There is no
alternative/substitute to POS terminals.
56\. Thus it is clear that the relevant geographic market of POS termina is
India. It is apparent that the Verifone held a position of strength in the
relevant market during the period of investigation by inter alia on account of
its market share, size, resources and economic power, dependence of consumers
on the appellant. Appellant and its acquired companies as noticed above had a
market share of approximately 80%.
57\. The clauses of SDK agreement were not as per the prevailing industry
practice. The DG compared similar SDK agreement entered by other players in
the market including Ingenico and Pax. The SDK agreement was non- negotiable
and intent of the appellant was found to exploit the VAS market by either
restricting the VAS providers or sharing the revenue from them. The email
dated 18.1.2012, 3.2.2012, 5.3.2012, 20.4.2012 supports the allegation of
exploitation on the VAS market by restricting the VAS provider.
58\. VAS providers like Pine Labs and FSS also imposed with similar
restrictive clauses by the appellant. The clauses in SDK agreement were
restricted and therefore, it was found to be in violation of Section
4(2)(a)(i), 4(2)(b)(i) and 4(2)(b)(ii) and 4(2)(e) of the Act.
59\. The Commission after considering the DG report, objections/reply filed by
the appellant and the informant and other evidence by impugned order dated
10th April, 2015 found the appellant was abusing its dominant position
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  23
under Section 4 of the Act and imposed punishment on the appellant in the case
of Atos Worldline India Pvt Ltd.
60\. We have noticed that the instrument is the factor for the purpose of
dominance and not the app i.e. the end use ETM distinct characteristics or POS
terminals. If the dominance is made because of the instrument, the same
principle will be applicable also in the case of Three D Integrated Solution
Ltd for determination of dominance.
61\. So far as abuse of dominance in the case of Three D Integrated Solutions
Ltd , the DG in its report dated 30.5.2014 after investigation for the period
2009-10 to September 2012 came to a definite conclusion that the relevant
product in question is not ETMs as the machines provided by the appellant were
not only capable of providing electronic record/printed receipts but also
capable of providing electronic payment through credit/debit cards. Copy of
the purchase order 5.4.2012 also mentions the product as a POS terminal,
therefore, it is clear that ETMs were Europay, Mastercard and Visa and PCI
(Payment card industry) certified. The purpose of EMV and PCI certification is
for transfer of payment only.
62\. The reply from Ingenico, another POS vendors, confirms that POS terminals
can be converted into ETM without the knowledge of the sellers and there is no
difference between the hardware of the two devices. New technologies such as
Easy Tap or Mswipe cannot be considered as substitute of the POS terminals.
There is no alternative/substitute to POS terminals.
63\. The relevant market for POS terminal is in India under Section 2(t) of
the Act. Relevant geographic market is under Section 2(r) of the Act. We hold
TA(AT)(Competition)No.1 and 2 of 2017 (Old Appeals No.82 and 83 of 2015)  24
that the relevant market for the ETM is also India under Section 2(t) of the
Act, The relevant geographical market of ETM is also India under Section 2(r)
of the Act. The appellant was having a dominant position in the relevant
market of POS/ETMs in particular the instrument in question, held a position
of strength in the relevant market during the period of investigation and
allegations inter alia on account of its market share, size, resources and
economic power, dependence of consumers were on the appellant.
64\. In the aforesaid facts corroborated with evidence and accepted by DG as
well as enquiry by the Commission, we find no case is made out to interfere in
the judgement both dated 10.04.2015 in both the cases. The appellants were
entitled to be penalised but we find that the Commission has taken a lenient
view by imposing penal cost in one case and no penal cost in the other case.
In absence of any merit the appeals are dismissed. No costs.
