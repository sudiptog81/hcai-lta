We are amazed that despite Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act,
2000 having been declared ultra vires by the Apex Court in Shreya Singhal vs.
Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1 yet F.I.R's are being registered in our State
under the said provision. Taking cognizance of the aforesaid illegality, the
Apex Court in Peoples' Union For Civil Liberties vs. Union of India and
Others, W.P. (Crl) No.199/2013 passed the following order on 15.2.2019:-
"The learned Attorney General appears before us and has made a concrete
suggestion, which we accept. The suggestion is that copies of this Court's
to the Chief Secretaries of all the State Governments and the Union
Territories. This should be done within a period of eights weeks from today.
The Chief Secretaries will, in turn, sensitise the police departments in this
country by sending copies of this judgment to the Director General of Police
in each State, within a period of eights weeks thereafter.
The application stands disposed of accordingly."
We are back to square one wherein the instant FIR has been registered under
Section 66-A of the I.T. Act, 2000. Prima facie the action discloses complete
disregard to the orders of the Hon'ble Apex Court. We could have summoned the
senior police officials but refrain from doing so in view of the current
pandemic.
However, the IO shall be physically present along with records and his
explanation.
List on 20.7.2020.
Till the next date, investigation and arrest of the petitioner in Case Crime
No.0070/2020, under Section 66-A of the Information Technology (Amendment)
suggestion, which we accept. The suggestion is that copies of this Court's
judgment in 'Shreya Singhal v. Union of India' [(2015) 5 SCC 1] will be made
available by every High Court in this country to all the District Courts. This
should be done within a period of eight weeks from today.
Also, we direct the Union Government to make available copies of this judgment
