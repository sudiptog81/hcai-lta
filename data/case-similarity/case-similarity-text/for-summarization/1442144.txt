ORDER
1\. This appeal is against the judgment of the Customs, Excise and Gold
(Control) Appellate Tribunal dated 4th March, 1999. The question is whether
the parts used for repair or replacement during the warranty period are
excisable. This question is answered by a decision of this Court rendered on
25th March, 2003 in Civil Appeal Nos. 3643-3644 of 1999 . On the principles
laid down in that decision, it is held that duty is payable on the parts.
2\. However, in this case a further question arises i.e. whether in respect of
the concerned show cause notice dated 27th May, 1994, the respondents were
entitled to invoke the extended period of limitation under Section 11A of the
Central Excise Act, 1944. The Tribunal negatived the contention of the
appellant and hold that there was suppression and therefore the extended
period of limitation was available.
3\. Some few facts necessary for a decision on this point are as follows :-
The appellants were using parts, in respect of which the Modvat credit was
by an order dated 2nd March, 1994. Thereafter, the concerned show cause notice
dated 27th May, 1994 was issued. This has been adjudicated by an order dated
13th November, 1997.
4\. In the case of P & B Pharmaceutical (P) Ltd. v. Collector of Central
Excise reported in Also , the question was whether the extended period of
limitation could be invoked where the Department has earlier issued show cause
notices in respect of the same subject-matter. It has been held that in such
circumstances, it could not be said that there was any wilful suppression or
mis-statement and that therefore, the extended period under Section 11A could
not be invoked.
5\. In our view, the principles laid down in above case fully apply here. As
earlier proceedings in respect of same subject matter were pending
adjudication it could not be said that there was any suppression and the
extended period under Section 11A was not available.
6\. To this extent the impugned judgment requires to be and is set aside.
Ordered accordingly.
The appellants were using parts, in respect of which the Modvat credit was
availed. Even though they have not paid duty, they did not reverse the credit.
The Department, therefore, issued show cause notices on 28th May, 1993 and 4th
November, 1993. By these two show cause notices the appellants were called
upon to show cause as to why duty and penalty be not levied on them for not
having reversed the Modvat credit. These show cause notices were adjudicated
by an order dated 2nd March, 1994. Thereafter, the concerned show cause notice
dated 27th May, 1994 was issued. This has been adjudicated by an order dated
13th November, 1997.

adjudication it could not be said that there was any suppression and the
extended period under Section 11A was not available.
6\. To this extent the impugned judgment requires to be and is set aside.
Ordered accordingly.
7\. It must also be mentioned that as there is no suppression, penalty cannot
be imposed.
8\. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to
costs.

dated 27th May, 1994 was issued. This has been adjudicated by an order dated
