A copy of the rules and regulations of the society, certified to be a correct copy by not less than three of the members of the governing body, shall be filed with the memorandum of association. State Amendments
(Gujarat) —(i) Renumber section 2 as sub-section (1) thereof and in sub-
section (1) as so renumbered after and below the words “the name of the
society”, insert the following, namely:— “the place of situation of the

COMMENTS Under the Act, a committee of management can be framed to manage the
affairs of society and the committee is to manage the affairs of the society
for a period as specified in its Rules, Bye-laws or Regulations as the case
may be. Therefore, if a society runs not only a college but an institution
like hospital also the committee of management, constituted under the Act will
be managing the affairs of the hospital while the committee of management
which has to be formed under the scheme of Administration will have to manage
the affairs of the college. That necessarily means that the committee so
constituted under different statutes have separate identities and separate
duties to perform depending upon the nature and extent of activities of the
society. Where the society in question runs only the college and that both the
Committees of Management constituted under the Act and under the scheme of
Administration were the same, with the expiry of the term of the committee
constituted for the society would also expire because it had no affairs to
manage; Ram Sajiwan v. The II Additional District Judge, Fatehpur, AIR 1994
NOC 273 (All). The rules and regulations given in the memorandum of
association form a contract amongst the members of the society and they are
necessarily required to be registered under statute, these rules or
regulations do not acquire any statutory character. And even if rules or bye-
laws do not provide for the observance of the rules of natural justice before
an expulsion, the courts will imply them in the contract which is a body of
rules or bye-laws; State Bank of India Staff Association v Mohindra
Bhattacharyya, AIR 1991 Cal 378. The Registrar can refuse to register a
society in case all the necessary requirements as contemplated in the Act are
not fulfilled; Shanti Sarup v. Radhaswami Satsang Sabha, Dayalbagh, Agra, AIR
1969 All 248.
3. Registration and fees.—Upon such memorandum and certified copy being filed, the Registrar shall certify under his hand that the society is registered under this Act. There shall be paid to the Registrar for every such registration a fee of fifty rupees, or such smaller fees as 1[the State Government] may, from time to time, direct; and all fees so paid shall be accounted for to 1[the State Government.] State Amendments Andhra Pradesh.—In section 3, for the words “the Registrar” wherever they occur, substitute the words “the Inspector-General”.

the words “Inspector-General of Registration.” [Vide Bihar Act 19 of 1956,
sec. 3 (w.r.e.f. 21-12-1955).] Goa, Daman and Diu.—In section 3,—

General for”. [Vide Goa Act 6 of 1979, sec. 3 (w.e.f. 16-8-1979).]

section 3, for the full stop at the end of section, substitute a colon and add
thereafter the following proviso,— “Provided that the State Government may by
notification in Official Gazette exempt any particular society or class of
societies from the payment of registration fee.” [Vide H.P. Act 8 of 1965,
sec. 2 (w.e.f. 26-11-1965); Act 23 of 1973, sec. 3 (w.e.f. 4-12-1973).]
(Maharashtra) —(i) In section 3, the following proviso shall be inserted,
namely:— “Provided that no such fee shall be payable for the registration of a
society formed with the object of running an educational institution in any
area in which, the Central Provinces and Berar Vidya Mandir Act, 1939, is in
force, if the objects are similar to the objects of a Vidya Mandir established
under Part I of that Act.” [Vide Bombay Act 76 of 1958, sec. 3 (w.e.f.
7-10-1958).]
(ii) Vidarbha Region.—In its application to the Vidarbha region of the State
of Maharashtra the amendment made in section 3 by C.P. and Berar Act III of
1940 shall cease to have effect and is repealed. [Vide Bombay Act 76 of 1958,

sec. 89.] Tamil Nadu.—In its application to the State of Madras, the amendment
made in section 3 is the same as that in Andhra Pradesh. [Vide T.N. Act 24 of
1954, sec. 2 (iii) (w.e.f. 1-9-1954).] Uttar Pradesh.— For section 3,

certified copy being filed along with particulars of the address of the
Society as office which shall be in registered address, by the Secretary of
the Society on behalf of the persons subscribing to the memorandum, the
Registrar shall certify under his hand that the society is registered under
