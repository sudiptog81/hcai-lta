                           JUDGMENT
Meenakshi Madan Rai, J.
1\. This common Judgment disposes of the assailed Orders, both dated
19.06.2017, in RFA No.08 of 2017 and RFA No.09 of 2017 arising out of IPR Suit
No.2 of 2015 (M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. v. Tara Palace Hotel and
Others) and IPR Suit No.1 of 2016 (M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. v.
Arthur's Plur and Others) respectively, (hereinafter referred to as ―IPR Suit
No.2‖ and ―IPR Suit No.1‖).
2\. Before delving into a discussion on the merits of the instant Appeal, it
is pertinent to mention here for clarity that in the impugned Order dated
19.06.2017, in IPR Suit No.2 the following applications came to be decided;
> 1\. Order VII Rule 14(3) read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil
> Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter the ―CPC‖);
> 2\. Order XXXIX Rule 2A read with Section 151 of the CPC;
> 3\. Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC; and
> 4\. Order XXXIX Rule 4 of the CPC, 1908.
(a) While dealing with the application under Order VII Rule 14(3) read with
Section 151 of the CPC, the learned trial Court held in the impugned Order
that, in view of the nature of the additional documents filed by the
Appellant, they were necessary for effective adjudication of the case and
allowed the additional documents to be filed.
RFA No.08 of 2017 3
M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA
No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
(b) While deciding the application under Order XXXIX Rule 2A read with Section
151 of the CPC filed by the Appellant against the Respondent No.1, for
violation of injunction order dated 21.12.2015, it was observed that the
Respondent No.1 had paid the Licence Fee to the Appellant and the application
under Order XXXIX Rule 2A, read with Section 151 of the CPC not being pressed
by the Appellant was disposed of accordingly.
(c) Considering the application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 of the CPC filed by
the Respondent No.1, the learned trial Court took into consideration the
discussions which had ensued in the application filed under Order VII Rule 11
of the CPC filed by the Respondent No.1 (which shall be discussed later
hereinbelow) and observed that there was no necessity to pass any order in the
said petition.
(d) It may relevantly be noted that the records reveal that an application was
filed by the Appellant under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151
of the CPC on 21.12.2015. Vide the Order dated 24.03.2016, the learned trial
Court recorded inter alia that ―the Order dated 21.12.2015 stands confirmed"
and the application was disposed of, however the final order did not make a
mention of this application.
3\. In IPR Suit No.1, the following applications were decided by the learned
trial Court;
> 1\. Order XXXIX Rule 2A read with Section 151 of the CPC;
> 2\. Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC; and  RFA No.08 of 2017 4 M/s. Phonographic
> Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
> Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
> 3\. Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC, 1908.
(a) The learned trial Court while disposing of the application under Order
XXXIX Rule 2A read with Section 151 of the CPC rejected it on grounds that the
Appellant had failed to establish violation of the Order of injunction of the
learned trial Court dated 07.03.2016.
(b) Although an application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 had been filed,
however only the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC was taken up
for hearing. In the impugned Order, it was concluded that there was no
necessity to pass any order on the petition filed by the Respondents No.1 and
2 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC.
4\. While considering the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC in
both IPR Suit No.2 and IPR Suit No.1, the learned trial Court took to
discussing the provisions of Section 33 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (for short
―the Act‖) and observed that the contents of the Plaint and the documents
filed by the Appellant establish that the Appellant was "conceived,
incorporated and is carrying on the business of issuing and granting licences
in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in
cinematograph films or sound recordings as contemplated under Section 33 of
the Act.‖ That prior to the year 2013, the Appellant was registered as a
copyright society under Section 33 of the Act and involved in the business of
issuing and granting licences, however Annexure B of the Appellant's document
clarified that the Appellant was not as  RFA No.08 of 2017 5 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others of date registered
under Section 33 of the Act and thereby concluded that the Appellant was not a
copyright society as contemplated under Section 33 of the Act.
(a) Section 19, Section 30 and Section 30A of the Act were taken up together
for discussion wherein it was observed that the Appellant was to have produced
ownership documents. That, Annexure B a Deed of Partial and Limited Assignment
of Rights in Sound Recordings is between Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. and
the Appellant, both registered under the Companies Act, 1956. That, the
Appellant had averred that Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. had assigned their
rights to the Appellant and that Annexure E disclosed the owners of copyright
of the sound recordings. However, it was observed that to maintain a Suit for
infringement it was to be filed by the owner or the exclusive licensee of the
copyright. If it is filed by the latter (as was the Appellant purportedly)
then the owners of the copyright viz. Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. was
necessarily to be impleaded as Defendants, which the Appellant has failed to
do, thereby failing to comply with the provisions of Section 61 of the Act.
That, the Appellant has levelled allegations of infringement of copyright
without material particulars or cogent evidence of such infringement and
thereby concluded that the Suit was liable to be dismissed for not disclosing
the cause of action and also for non-compliance of Section 61, Section 19 and
Section 30A of the Act. The petitions under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC came
to be thus dismissed.

M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA
No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
5\. The Suits (supra) before the learned trial Court was for declaration,
permanent injunction and consequential reliefs. The Appellant claimed to be
the owner of the copyright in sound recordings having obtained exclusive
assignment of copyright in the sound recordings from the assignors. Vide
―Annexure B‖ the Deed of Assignment with Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd.,
―Annexure II to Schedule A of the Plaint‖ and ―Annexure E‖ this claim was
sought to be buttressed. It was also averred that a list of more than 250
music labels have granted assignment to the Appellant and a list of the
assignor music labels was available on its website. That, if the sound
recordings so assigned are to be exploited by any user for commercial
purposes, they can do so only on obtaining licence from the Appellant, who is
entitled to issue or grant licences and collect Licence Fees from such users.
That the Respondents No.1, 2 and 3 are communicating the sound recordings of
the Appellant without obtaining such a valid licence in wilful infringement of
copyright subsisting therein. The reliefs prayed for by the Appellant before
the learned trial Court inter alia were as follows;
> "(a) Declaration that the plaintiff is exclusively entitled to administer
> the copyright in respect of their and/or defendant no. 4's sound recordings
> and the defendants have no right to exploit/use the sound recordings as
> shown in Annexure-E without a valid license from the Plaintiff;
> (b) A Decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant nos. 1, 2 and
> 3 and their men, agents and assigns from communicating sound recordings, as
> shown in Annexure-E music video of the plaintiff without obtaining a licence
> from the plaintiff;
> (c) A Decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant nos. 1, 2 and
> 3 and their men, agents and assigns from infringing the copyright in the
> sound recordings, music  RFA No.08 of 2017 7 M/s. Phonographic Performance
> Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
> Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others video of the
> members of the plaintiff as shown in Annexure- E without obtaining a license
> from the plaintiff; ..."
6.(a) Raising the argument before this Court that the rejection of the Plaint
on grounds given in the Order was wholly perverse, it was contended by learned
Counsel for the Appellant that despite allowing the application of the
Appellant under Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC, wherein the Deed of
Assignment executed between the relevant parties was accepted, the learned
trial Court erroneously concluded that the Appellant was a Licensee. In fact
the Deed of Assignment was executed by and between the Appellant and the
erstwhile owners of the sound recordings, by virtue of which the Appellant
stepped into the shoes of the original owners. That, an error emanated in
rejecting the Plaint on the ground of Section 19 of the Act after the Deed of
Assignment was taken on record and not declared to be null and void. The
learned trial Court failed to take into consideration the list of sound
recordings of the assignors which form part of Schedule A, and specifically
mentions that past, present and future sound recording works owned by the
Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. are assigned to the Appellant. Reasoning that
the Suit was filed in the manner of a quia timet action and/or apprehensive
infringements to be committed by the Respondents, it was canvassed that the
learned trial Court erroneously concluded that insufficient evidence was
furnished in the Plaint to indicate infringement by the Respondents but failed
to consider that documents accompanying the Plaint were to be tested at the
time of trial. That, the impugned Order while  RFA No.08 of 2017 8 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09
of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
alleging non-compliance by the Appellant of Section 30 of the Act is devoid of
reasons.
(b) That, consideration was also not extended to the grievance of the
Appellant pertaining to wrongful exploitation of the sound recordings by the
Respondents despite relevant details having been disclosed in the documents
relied upon by the Appellant. That, the Appellant as owner of the copyright
was entitled to issue Licence to third parties if the said parties sought to
exploit the sound recordings of the Appellant but sans Licence such
exploitation would tantamount to infringement. Although notices were issued to
the Respondents to obtain Licence for use of the assigned sound recordings,
these were ignored and the learned trial Court paid scant attention to this
aspect, nor did the Respondents undertake not to exploit the sound recordings
of the Appellant. Drawing the attention of the Court to the verification
clause in the application filed by the Respondent No.1 under Order VII Rule 11
of the CPC, it was submitted that it was verified by one Gauranga Dalal and
not by the Respondent No.1, hence the application itself is defective.
(c) That, literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works are works which can
be distinguished from a work of sound recording under Section 2(y)(iii) of the
Act. That, Section 33 of the Act in effect restricts any agent or third party
from issuing Licences for other copyright works without disclosing the name of
the original author and/or owner of such copyright to prevent wrong
appropriation of Licence Fees, however in the instant case  RFA No.08 of 2017
9 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA
No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
such a question does not arise as the Appellant himself is the owner of the
copyright and is claiming Licence Fees from the Respondents for exploiting
and/or intending to exploit such sound recordings of the Appellant. The
learned trial Court opined that the Appellant is not a Copyright Society as
contemplated under Section 33 of the Act, when in fact this Section protects
the rights of the owners of copyright including the sound recordings of which
the Appellant is the owner and can exercise rights under Section 30 of the
Act, therefore there was an inability to distinguish between Section 33 and
Section 30 of the Act. The learned trial Court dealt with the matter as if it
was that of a Licensee when in fact it pertains to an assignee. That, although
Section 33 of the Act was discussed in the impugned Order, the learned trial
Court did not dismiss the suit as being barred by law under Section 33 of the
Act. As the Respondents failed to prefer any cross appeal against this
observation, they cannot urge this issue in Appeal. It was also contended that
without assigning reasons as to how Section 30A of the Act suffered from non-
compliance, the Plaint was rejected. That the learned trial Court was also in
error in dismissing the Suit for non-compliance of Section 61 of the Act since
the Appellant is the owner by way of assignment thereby rendering nugatory the
necessity of impleading the assignors. That apart, Respondent No.4 Sony Music
Entertainment India Pvt. Ltd. has been made a party in terms of Section 61 of
the Act as the said Company had only licensed its rights in sound recordings
to the Appellant.  RFA No.08 of 2017 10
M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA
No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
While asserting their ownership rights on the sound recordings as an assignee,
reliance was placed on the provisions of Section 2(d)(v) of the Act as also
Section 2 (uu), Section 2 (y)(iii), Section 13(1)(c), Section 17, Section 18
and Section 19 of the Act. These submissions were fortified by the ratio in
Saregama Ltd. v. New Digital Media and Others 1 and International
Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (ICSAC) V. Aditya Pandey
and Others2 followed by the prayer that the impugned Order be set aside.
7\. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent No.1, in vehement repudiation,
raised the contention that the reasons for dismissal of the Suit under Order
VII Rule 11 of the CPC was three pronged viz. the Suit did not disclose a
cause of action; secondly, it was barred by Section 33 of the Act and thirdly
by Section 61 of the Act in view of the non-joinder of the necessary parties
being Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. That, the reliefs prayed for by the
Appellant before the learned trial Court are bereft of indications that there
was an infringement by the Respondents, hence the reliefs prayed for cannot be
granted. Referring to Section 19 of the Act, learned Senior Counsel contended
that although the Appellant submits that the copyright of the works was
assigned to them, however when one peruses Schedule A to the Plaint, it is
clear that the details of the songs assigned to the Appellant has not been
given. That, although Annexure E details the sound recordings, however it 1
2018 AIR CC 3171 (Cal) 2 (2017) 11 SCC 437  RFA No.08 of 2017 11 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09
of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others has
not been signed by the assignor and the Schedule is blank and hence cannot be
relied upon by the Appellant to establish its case. Thus, there is a clear
non-compliance of Section 19(2) of the Act which requires that the assignment
of copyright in any work shall identify such work and shall specify the rights
assigned, the duration and territorial extent of such assignment. Referring to
Section 30 of the Act, he put forth the argument that this Section requires
that the owner of the copyright in any existing work or the prospective owner
of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest in the right by
Licence in writing or by his duly authorized agent, but the Appellant has no
such rights. That the provisions of Section 33 of the Act which deals with
registration of Copyright Society is to be considered along with Section 17 to
Section 19 and Section 14(e)(iii) of the Act. That, a reading of the Sections
supra would clearly indicate that the right granted to the Appellant is only
under Section 14(e)(iii) of the Act viz. to communicate the sound recording,
it does not authorize the Appellant to grant Licence which is reserved for the
owner of the copyright and is to be done in his individual capacity as
envisaged in the proviso to Section 33 of the Act. This emanates from the fact
that the Appellant is not the original owner. The pleadings before the learned
trial Court clearly indicate that prior to amendment of the Copyright Act,
1957, the Appellant was a Performing Rights Society and after the 2012
Amendment and consequent to the new Copyright Rules, the Appellant started
working as a Company and has been  RFA No.08 of 2017 12 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others fixing tariffs at
random for use of the sound recordings. Section 51 of the Act provides for
consequences when a copyright is infringed, therefore if the Appellant had a
grievance of infringement of copyright, they ought to have brought an
infringement Suit and not demanded money as made out in their prayers. That,
by skillful drafting, the Appellant has avoided showing infringement but has
actually brought a Suit for collection of Licence Fees. It was further
submitted that the learned trial Court has correctly held that the owner ought
to have been impleaded as a party, in the absence of which, the Suit was not
maintainable, having failed to comply with the provisions of Section 61 of the
Act as the Appellant is not the owner of the copyright. Consequently, the law
prohibits the Appellant from licensing so the question of paying tariff to
them for the sound recordings does not arise. Reliance was placed on
Phonographic Performance Ltd. v. Hotel Gold Regency & Ors.3.
8\. While placing arguments in IPR Suit No.1, learned Counsel Mr. Ajay Rathi
and Mr. Tashi Norbu Basi for the Respondent No.3 submitted that in sum and
substance they endorse and adopt the arguments canvassed by learned Senior
Counsel Mr. K.T. Bhutia for the Respondents No.1 and 2.
9\. The submissions of learned Counsel for the parties have been considered
and all documents on record, the 3 AIR 2009 (Del) 11  RFA No.08 of 2017 13
M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA
No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
impugned Order and the citations relied on by learned Counsel for the parties
have been carefully perused.
10\. The discontent of the Appellant pivots around the dismissal of their Suit
under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC on grounds of non-disclosure of cause of
action and for non- compliance of Section 61, Section 19 and Section 30A of
the Act. Hence, the limited question that falls for consideration of this
Court is whether the impugned Orders can sustain.
11\. Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC inter alia provides that the Plaint shall be
rejected if it does not disclose a cause of action, is undervalued,
insufficiently stamped or the Suit appears to be barred by law, where the
Plaint is not filed in duplicate or for non-compliance of the provisions of
Order VII Rule 9 of the CPC. In the instant matters the provisions nudged into
service before the learned trial Court by the Respondents were under Order VII
Rule 11 (a) of the CPC ‗failure to disclose cause of action' and Order VII
Rule 11 (d) of the CPC ‗where the Suit appears to be barred by any law.'
Appositely, what constitutes a cause of action may be mulled over. In A.B.C.
Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Another v. A.P. Agencies, Salem4 it was held as
follows;
> ―12. A cause of action means every fact, which if traversed, it would be
> necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a
> judgment of the court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken
> with the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to relief
> against the defendant. It must include some act done by the defendant since
> in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is
> not limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on but includes all
> the 4 (1989) 2 SCC 163  RFA No.08 of 2017 14 M/s. Phonographic Performance
> Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
> Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others material facts on
> which it is founded. It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such
> facts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to
> obtain a decree. Everything which if not proved would give the defendant a
> right to immediate judgment must be part of the cause of action. But it has
> no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor
> does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the
> plaintiff.‖ In Saleem Bhai and Others v. State of Maharashtra and Others 5
> the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the provisions of Order VII Rule
> 11 of the CPC, observed as under;
> ―9. A perusal of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC makes it clear that the relevant facts
> which need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder are the
> averments in the plaint. The trial court can exercise the power under Order
> 7 Rule 11 CPC at any stage of the suit -- before registering the plaint or
> after issuing summons to the defendant at any time before the conclusion of
> the trial. For the purposes of deciding an application under clauses (a) and
> (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 CPC, the averments in the plaint are germane; the
> pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly
> irrelevant at that stage, ...‖
> 12\. In this context, the observation of the learned trial Court is to the
> effect that for the purpose of obtaining a relief, the facts averred are to
> be stated and proved but not the evidence, consequently the Appellant's
> petition under Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC which requires the Plaintiff
> to produce documents on which the cause of action is based, was allowed.
Thus, Annexure E came to be filed. Admittedly, ―Annexure B‖ i.e. the purported
Deed of Partial and Limited Assignment of Rights in Sound Recordings, executed
between the Appellant and Universal Music India Pvt. Ltd. and ―Annexure II to
Schedule A‖ of the Plaint had already been filed. The unequivocal claim of the
5 (2003) 1 SCC 557  RFA No.08 of 2017 15 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd.
vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others Appellant in the Suits filed is
that it is the ―owner‖ of the copyright of the sound recordings by way of
assignment vide the documents supra, which are being exploited by the
Respondents without licence from the Appellant. The claim of ownership by way
of assignment is sought to be substantiated by the documents enumerated supra.
They do not claim to be licensees nor do they claim to be agents on behalf of
any other copyright owners, hence their unflinching claim that as owners of
the copyright they can take steps in terms of the Act while issuing or
granting licences and connected matters thereto. As the Appellant does not
hold out any claims of being a copyright society as contemplated under Section
33 of the Act, it thereby contends that the prohibitions engrafted therein are
not applicable to it.
13\. ―Assignment‖ as per Black's Dictionary, Tenth Edition, Page 142 is as
follows;
> ―1. The transfer of rights or property <assignment of stock options>. 2. The
> rights or property so transferred.
―An assignment is a transfer or setting over of property, or of some right or
interest therein, from one person to another; the term denoting not only the
act of transfer, but also the instrument by which it is effected. In these
senses the word is variously applied in law.‖ Alexander M. Burrill, A Treatise
on the Law and Practice of Voluntary Assignments for the Benefit of Creditors
1, at 1 (James Avery Webb ed., 6th ed. 1894). ...‖ An ―assignee,‖ (ibid supra)
is defined as under;
> ―1. One to whom property rights or powers are transferred by another. Use of
> the term is so widespread that it is difficult to ascribe positive meaning
> to it with any specificity. Courts recognize the protean nature of the term
> and are therefore often forced to look to the intent of the assignor and
> assignee in making the assignment - rather  RFA No.08 of 2017 16 M/s.
> Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09
> of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others than
> to the formality of the use of the term assignee - in defining rights and
> responsibilities. - Also termed assign.‖
14\. In light of the above observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
context of cause of action and discussions which have emanated supra we may
usefully refer to Section 18 of the Act which inter alia provides that the
owner of the copyright in an existing work or the prospective owner of the
copyright in a future work may assign to any person the copyright either
wholly or partially and either generally or subject to limitations for the
whole of the copyright or any part thereof. The first proviso elucidates that
in the case of the assignment of copyright in any future work, the assignment
shall take effect only when the work comes into existence. The second proviso
details that no such assignment shall be applied to any mode of exploitation
of the work which did not exist or was not in commercial use at the time when
the assignment was made unless the assignment specifically refers to such mode
of exploitation of the work. Section 18(2) of the Act provides that where the
assignee of a copyright becomes entitled to any right comprised in the
copyright, the assignee in respect of the rights so assigned and the assignor
in respect of the rights not assigned, shall be treated for the purpose of
this Act as the owner of the copyright and the provisions of this Act shall
have effect accordingly. Section 18(3) of the Act provides that the expression
―assignee‖ in respect of the assignment of the copyright in any future work
includes the legal representatives of  RFA No.08 of 2017 17 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others the assignee, if
the assignee dies before the work comes into existence.
15\. The mode of assignment of copyright is described in Section 19 of the Act
which lays down that no assignment of the copyright in any work shall be valid
unless it is in writing signed by the assignor or by his duly authorized
agent. Section 19(2) of the Act provides that the assignment of copyright in
any work shall identify such work and shall specify the rights assigned, the
duration and the territorial extent of the assignment. That apart, in terms of
Section 19(3) of the Act, the assignment of copyright in any work shall also
specify the amount of royalty to the author or his legal heirs during the
currency of the assignment which shall also be subject to revision, extension
or termination on terms mutually agreed upon by the parties. Section 19(4) of
the Act states with clarity that if the assignee does not exercise the rights
assigned to him under any of the Sub-Sections of this Section within a period
of one year, his rights will lapse unless otherwise mentioned in the
assignment. The assignment shall be deemed to be for a period of five years if
the period of assignment is not provided, this is provided in Section 19(5) of
the Act. The territorial extent if not specified, shall be presumed to extend
to the whole of India in terms of Section 19(6) of the Act. These provisions
however shall not be applicable to assignment made before the Copyright
(Amendment) Act, 1994. Section 19(8) of the Act renders void the assignment of
copyright in any work contrary to the terms and conditions of the  RFA No.08
of 2017 18 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others
And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and
Others rights already assigned to a copyright society in which the author of
the work is a member. Section 19(9) of the Act deals with assignment of
copyright in any work and lays down that no such assignment to make a
cinematograph film shall affect the right of the author of the work to claim
an equal share of royalties and consideration payable in case of utilization
of the work in any other form other than for communication of the work to the
public along with the cinematograph film in a cinema hall. Section 19(10) of
the Act provides that no assignment of the copyright in any work to make a
sound recording which does not form part of any cinematograph film shall
affect the right of the author of the work to claim an equal share of
royalties and consideration payable for any utilization of such work in any
form.
16\. ―Licences‖ is however discussed in Chapter VI of the Act. Section 30 of
the Act provides that the owner of the copyright in any existing work or the
prospective owner of the copyright in any future work may grant any interest
in the right, by licence, in writing by him or by his duly authorized agent.
The proviso to Section 30 of the Act is concerned with licence relating to
copyright in any future work and lays down that such licence shall take effect
only when the work comes into existence. The explanation therewith is that if
a person to whom such a licence relating to copyright in any future work is
granted dies before the work sees the light of day, his legal representatives
shall be  RFA No.08 of 2017 19 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Tara
Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance
Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others entitled to the benefit of the licence
provided there is no provision to the contrary in the licence.
17\. On the anvil of the provisions of Section 18 and Section 19 of the Act
supra, a cursory look at ―Annexure B‖ inter alia reveals as under:
> ―This Deed (―Deed‖) is being entered into by and between, Universal Music

all other telecom related rights (i.e. except the rights granted herein) with
respect to the Music Catalogue are retained by the Music Label.
...............................................................................................................
1.4 It is clarified that all rights and interests in and to copyright in the
Sound Recordings of the ―Music Catalogue‖, save and except for the limited and
partial assignment as provided for in above-named modes and mediums of
monetization, continue to vest with the Music Label.
2\. Definitions "Music Catalogue" shall mean all past, present and future
Sound Recordings, published or unpublished in which Copyright subsists,
including derivatives or variations or portions or embodiments thereof,
together with associated meta-data, art-work, images, promotional and
ancillary material, which are owned by the Music Label and/or controlled by
the Music Label through exclusive licensing/contractual arrangements and in
respect of which the Music Label has lawful, un-encumbered and effective
rights to enter into this Deed.
(emphasis supplied) Without affecting the generality of the foregoing, the
Music Label agrees to provide detailed particulars of the Sound Recordings,
comprising the Music Catalogue to PPL in full, as per prescribed format and
submit the same to PPL within 7 days from the date of execution of this Deed,
by way of Schedule A ―Music Catalogue‖ to this Deed. The same shall be sent
from official email id or by way of data stored in CD; if sent in any other
manner (eg hard-copy printout), the same shall require (physical or digital)
signature by both parties. The Music Label hereby agrees and undertakes to
inform PPL in writing about any additions/deletions from time to time and the
same shall form part of Schedule A ―Music Catalogue‖, as and when particulars
of such additions/deletions are received from the Music Label by PPL.
...............................................................................................................
6.4 PPL warrants that it is entitled to grant licences u/s 30 of the Copyright
Act. PPL confirms and undertakes to institute appropriate legal proceedings
against infringers of copyright in the Music Catalogue in order to protect the
rights granted to PPL herein, at all times during the subsistence of this
Deed.

No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others
(emphasis supplied)
7\. Miscellaneous 7.1 The Music Label agrees that PPL is entitled to grant
licences u/s 30 of Copyright Act, on ownership basis (as covered by sub-
Section 18(2) of Copyright Act). 7.2 Music Label recognises that PPL has full
authority, with prior intimation to the Music Label, to take all steps as may
be necessary for the purpose of protecting the assigned rights from
infringement in any manner whatsoever, including the filing or defending of
any litigation or proceeding before a Court or tribunal or police, giving
undertakings, settling or withdrawing any actions instituted for this purpose
either by or against PPL and generally to take all steps as PPL may deem fit
for the purpose of giving substantial and complete effect to these presents.
Music Label recognises and agrees that PPL has the right to send notices and
to initiate or defend legal proceedings for infringement of the assigned
rights, copyright disputes, money recovery, etc., in its own name, without
naming the Music Label as a party to the litigation or proceedings. The Music
Label ratifies all past acts done by PPL, including existing, on-going
litigations in any Court of law or tribunal or police, both civil and
criminal. ...‖
18\. On the touchstone of what ―assignment‖ means and in view of the details
set out in ―Annexure B‖ supra as also the signatures which are affixed on
various documents relied on by the Appellant, the learned trial Court in my
considered opinion ought to have allowed the Appellant an opportunity of
leading evidence pertaining to the documents so as to establish whether the
necessary details as mandated by the provisions of the Act were forthcoming in
the documents filed by it. The claim of ownership of the copyright could have
been either established or disproved by way of allowing the documents to be
examined and juxtaposing it with the relevant provisions of the Act. Of course
the documents would have to pass the strict rigours of proof as laid down in
the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The Appellant had averred that there was an
infringement of their rights by the Respondents who failed to obtain licence
to exploit the sound  RFA No.08 of 2017 22 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd.
vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others recordings owned by them. They
claim ownership of the sound recordings on the bedrock of assignment vide
documents filed by them. It is not the Appellant's case that they are
licensees or agents of any company. The documents of the Appellant were
therefore also required to be examined in terms of the provisions of Section
18 and Section 19 of the Act as also the related provisions agitated by the
Appellant. Without considering the documents the Suits could not have been
thrown out at the threshold. As the learned trial Court had allowed additional
documents under Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC, the documents so allowed
ought to have been tested by evidence instead of holding that there was non-
disclosure of the cause of action or non-compliance of Section 61, Section 19
and Section 30A of the Act when the claim was of ownership. Consequently, I
find that the Suits do not suffer from the deficiency of non- disclosure of
cause of action.
19\. It may appositely be pointed out that the learned trial Court also went
on to discuss the provisions of Section 33 of the Act and concluded that the
Appellant was not a copyright society under Section 33 of the Act but did not
specify as to what consequences followed thereto. So far as non-compliance of
Section 61 of the Act is concerned this would arise only after the learned
trial Court had examined the documents and arrived at the finding as to
whether the Appellant was either the owner of the copyright or not. Dismissal
of the Suit on this ground would only arise consequent thereto. With regard to
Respondent No.4  RFA No.08 of 2017 23 M/s. Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs.
Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others (Sony Music Entertainment India
Pvt. Ltd.), it is an admitted position that they are licensees of the rights
in sound recordings to the Appellant and in terms of Section 61 of the Act
have been impleaded as a Respondent. In the same thread, the application of
the provisions of Section 30 and Section 30A of the Act would also only have
arisen subsequent to the finding of the Court as to whether the Appellant was
indeed the owner of the copyright after examining the provisions of Section 18
and Section 19 of the Act based on the documents relied on by the Appellant.
At this stage, I refrain from examining the provisions of Section 30, Section
30A and Section 61 of the Act, lest it be construed as touching upon the
merits of the controversy, which would consequently prejudice either of the
parties in the Suit.
20\. The finding that the allegations of infringement were not fortified by
cogent evidence is undoubtedly premature for the above stated reasons. If
there was a dichotomy in the averments of the Appellant pertaining to
―licensee‖ and ―assignee,‖ the contradictory claims if any, ought to have been
examined by evidence. The Suits were dismissed as if the final hearing had
concluded when in fact the Court did not have the benefit of examining and
considering the documents on the basis of which the claim of the Appellant
emanated.
21\. To address the contention of the Appellant that the verification clause
in the Affidavit in the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC was
defective, on perusal thereof it is  RFA No.08 of 2017 24 M/s. Phonographic
Performance Ltd. vs. Tara Palace Hotel and Others And RFA No.09 of 2017 M/s.
Phonographic Performance Ltd. vs. Arthur's Plur and Others clear that the
deponent has stated that he was authorized to swear the Affidavit. Nothing
further remains for decision thereof.
22\. In view of the foregoing discussions and reasons enumerated, the impugned
Orders of the learned trial Court are set aside.
23\. Appeals in RFA No.08 of 2017 arising out of IPR Suit No.2 and RFA No.09
of 2017 arising out of IPR Suit No.1 are allowed.
24\. Both Suits are remanded to the learned trial Court with the following
directions;
(i) in IPR Suit No.2, the learned trial Court shall consider the matter after
the stage of Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC as documents sought to be filed
by the Appellant vide this petition have already been allowed;
(ii) in IPR Suit No.1, the matter shall be considered from the stage of
hearing of the petition under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC;
(iii) the matters be disposed of as per law.
25\. Consequently, both the Suits be restored to their respective original
numbers in the Register of the learned District Judge, East Sikkim at Gangtok.
26\. This Judgment is not and shall not be construed as observations on the
merits of the matter.
