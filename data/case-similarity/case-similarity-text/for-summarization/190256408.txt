Conclusion: -
40\. Thus, for the foregoing reasons I am not inclined to grant an injunction
in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. Consequently, the
captioned applications are dismissed.
41\. The defendants will, however, via their respective affidavits, place on
record the details, quantum, and value of drug manufactured and sold as also
indirect and direct taxes paid in that behalf. This information will be placed
on the Court's record every quarter.
41.1 The defendants will also provide details of their assets [encumbered and
unencumbered] which would include their location and current market value. The
information given in the affidavits will be backed by a certificate of a
statutory auditor. The defendants via their affidavits will also undertake to
pay damages as and when called upon to do so by the Court. These affidavits
will be filed within a period of 3 weeks.

By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 Preface: -
1\. The captioned actions concern, principally, two patents. These being:
a) Indian Patent No. 205147 [hereinafter referred to as: IN 147]
b) Indian Patent No. 235625 [hereinafter referred to as: IN 625]
2\. IN 147, as per the averments made in the plaint, is the genus patent while
IN 625 is claimed to be the species patent. The moot point, which arises for
consideration in the instant actions, is: whether the compound-in-issue i.e.
Dapagliflozin [in short "DAPA"] which, according to the plaintiffs, is covered
in IN 147 stands disclosed both, in law as well as on facts? 2.1 I must also
state, at the very outset, that there are various shades and limbs to this
broad frame which is the essence of the dispute obtaining between the parties.
2.2 Furthermore, for the sake of convenience, I would be referring to
plaintiff no. 1 i.e. AstraZeneca AB as "Astra Sweden" and plaintiff no. 2 i.e.
AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited as "Astra India". The defendant in CS (COMM)
410/2020 i.e. Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited will be referred to as "Intas";
while the defendant in CS (COMM) 411/2020 i.e. Alkem Laboratories Limited will
be referred to as "Alkem".
2.3 Besides this, wherever the context requires, Astra Sweden and Astra India
will collectively be referred to as the plaintiffs, and likewise, Intas and
Alkem will be collectively referred to as the defendants. Background: -
3\. Before I proceed further, the following broad contours of the case are
required to be noticed.
3.1 The first registered patent holder i.e. the grantee of these two patents
is an entity going by the name Bristol Myers Squibb Company [in short
"Bristol"]. Bristol, it appears, via an assignment deed dated 01.02.2014,
assigned the rights in the aforementioned patents in favour of Astra Sweden.
It is claimed that this Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM)

Page 3 of 84 By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 assignment
deed was placed on record of the patent's office by Astra Sweden via its
application dated 02.06.2014 and that as a result of this step having been
taken, it was registered as the patent holder qua the aforementioned patents.
3.2 Insofar as Astra India is concerned, it is averred in the plaint that it
is the only company in the country which has obtained the necessary statutory
approvals for importing and marketing DAPA in India. 3.3 The plaintiffs claim
that DAPA is used worldwide to treat people suffering from type-II diabetes
mellitus. According to the plaintiffs, this is achieved by DAPA acting as an
inhibitor of sodium-dependant glucose transporter i.e. SGLT2 in the kidneys.
3.4 It is, thus, claimed that DAPA aids in normalisation of plasma glucose
levels, and perhaps, body weight by enhancing glucose excretion. It is
averred, hyperglycaemia is a hallmark of type-II diabetes and the challenge,
therefore, is to control plasma glucose levels so as to prevent complications
which arise when the disease reaches an advance stage.
3.5 It is stated that plasma glucose is normally filtered in the kidneys in
the glomerulus which is then actively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
SGLT2, according to the plaintiffs, is a major transporter which is
responsible for the reuptake of glucose in the glomerulus. The SGLT2
inhibitors such as phlorizin and other closely related analogues inhibit the
re-uptake process. The selective inhibition of SGLT2 normalises plasma glucose
by enhancing excretion of glucose in the urine, thereby, improving insulin
sensitivity and, thus, delaying the development of diabetic complications such
as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, wound healing and other related
diseases. 3.6 It is also averred by the plaintiffs that the main claim in IN
147 is a Markush structure, in other words, a patent covering a group of
compounds which disclosed the possibility of individual permutations and
combinations that can run into several million [if not more] structurally
diverse compounds. In this context, it is also averred by the plaintiffs that,
although, IN 147 [which is the Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS
(COMM) No. 410/2020 & I.A. No. 8859/2020 in CS (COMM) No. Digitally Signed

genus patent and bears a Markush structure] covered DAPA, it did not disclose
the same. The case set up by the plaintiffs is that it was only when further
research and development was carried out to discover the most suitable, stable
and viable SGLT2 inhibitor, was DAPA invented.
4\. Given this backdrop, it would be relevant, at this stage, to note the
bibliography of IN 147 [the genus patent] and IN 625 [the species patent].

5\. It is in this background that the submissions were advanced on behalf of
the plaintiffs by Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. Harish Salve and Mr. Sudhir Chandra,
learned senior counsels and Mr. Pravin Anand instructed by Ms. Vaishali
Mittal.
5.1 Likewise, submissions on behalf of Intas were advanced by Mr. C.S.
Vaidyanathan, senior advocate instructed by Ms. Bitika Sharma while
submissions on behalf of Alkem were advanced by Mr. Adarsh Ramanujam also
instructed by Ms. Bitika Sharma. There was, in fact, another action listed
before me i.e. CS (COMM) 407/2020 in which arguments were made by Mr. J Sai
Deepak instructed by Mr. Guruswamy Nataraj. This action, at the interlocutory
stage, was de-tagged from the captioned actions as Mr. Natraj, on
instructions, made the following statement before me [which is recorded in the
order dated 22.10.2020] albeit at the nth hour when the judgement in matter
was about to be reserved:
> "I.A. No. 8791/2020
> 1\. Mr. Guru Nataraj, who appears for the defendant, in the captioned
> matter, says that he has received fresh instructions [even while arguments
> were being heard in the captioned application] that the defendant will not
> be manufacturing and/or launching its product as it has lost commercial
> interest in Dapagliflozin. 1.1 The statement of Mr. Nataraj is taken on

> 2\. Mr. Pravin Anand, who appears on behalf of the plaintiffs, in the
> captioned matter, says that in view of the statement made by Mr. Nataraj
> today, he would have no objection if the captioned application is disposed
> of. 3. The captioned application is, accordingly, closed in terms of the
> statement made on behalf of the defendant."
6\. The broad framework of the submissions made by each of the counsel are,
set forth hereafter.
On behalf of the plaintiffs: -
i. DAPA is a new, novel and man-made molecule which was first synthesized in
2001. It is a SGLT2 inhibitor which is useful in treatment Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 of type-II diabetes. It normalizes plasma
glucose by enhancing excretion of glucose in urine and, thus, improves insulin
sensitivity. ii. This drug, which is sold under the name Forxiga/Farxiga, has
been approved in 2020 for treatment of hypertensive heart failure [HHF] as
well. The plaintiffs' two distributors i.e. Sun Pharma Laboratories Limited
and Abbott Healthcare Private Limited [hereafter referred to as "Sun" and
"Abbott" respectively] market and sell the very same drug under various brand
names such as OXRA, OXRAMET, OXRAMET IR, OXRAMET XR, GLEDEPA, GLEDEPA MET,
GLEDEPA MET IR, AND GLEDEPA MET XR.
iii. IN 147, which is, the genus patent claims a Markush structure which has
22 variables and, hence, can lead to millions and perhaps billions of possible
permutations and combinations. While the Markush structure claimed by the
plaintiffs qua its genus patent i.e. IN 147 covers DAPA, it does not disclose
the same.
iv. While the genus patent i.e. IN 147 discloses 80 exemplified compounds [as
is evident from the complete specification of the said patent], DAPA is not
one of the disclosed compounds.
v. DAPA has been specifically disclosed in the species patent i.e. IN 625.
This patent has only two claims which specifically relate to DAPA. Claim 1
specifically lays the claim to compound DAPA as well as its pharmaceutical
acceptable salts stereoisomers or produgesters. Claim 2 lays, likewise,
specific claims to pharmaceutical compositions prepared using DAPA.
vi. IN 625 is a valid and a subsisting patent in India. It was granted on
07.07.2009, with 20.05.2002 as its priority date, and, accordingly, expires on
15.05.2023. It was published, in India, on 01.04.2005. The plaintiffs have
been granted patents qua DAPA in approximately 70 countries. In Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 India, DAPA has not been subjected to any
pre-grant or post-grant opposition or even revocation proceedings prior to
2020. vii. It is only in 2020, some entities have embarked on infringing the
aforementioned patents which led to institution of suits including the
captioned suits for patent infringement. It is only in 2020 that some of these
entities have initiated post-grant opposition, revocation proceedings or
counter-claims against IN 625.
viii. Insofar as the genus patent i.e. IN 147 is concerned, in India, it was
granted on 15.03.2007, with a priority date of 12.10.1999 and, thus, expired
on 02.02.2020. The patent was first published, in India, on 18.03.2005.
ix. Since DAPA was first synthesized in 2001, that is, after the priority date
of genus patent [IN 147] i.e. 12.10.1999, there can be no question of DAPA
being disclosed in the genus patent.
x. The Patents Act, 1970 [in short "the Act] requires the patentee to
disclose, with specificity, two aspects.
a) First, what is the invention?
b) Second, what is the best method of performing the invention as known to the
inventor? Reliance, in this behalf, was placed on provisions of Section
10(4)(b), 11(3), 11(3)(a) and 11(4) of the Act.
xi. The defendants have placed considerable reliance on formula of Claim 1B
within IN 147 i.e. the genus patent to emphasize their point that it discloses
DAPA. This contention is flawed for the reason that formula 1B itself would
have more than 1 billion permutations and combinations. xii. The attempt of
the defendants to reach DAPA, either through Claim 1 of IN 147 or from the
genus formula 1B, is nothing but an application of hindsight wisdom which is a
technique which Courts have not accepted under the patent law.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 xiii. Disclosure is a question of
fact which can be ascertained only by reading the patent document i.e.
document pertaining to IN 147. Disclosure of information can only occur upon
it being disclosed to the public at large. General or fleeting disclosure is
not countenanced under patent law. Disclosure in the context of novelty can be
established only if it is referred to in the earlier patent by way of chemical
name; chemical formula; chemical structure etcetera. [See: Eli Lily, Apotex,
2010 FCA 214] xiv. Markush formulae are well recognised under the Indian
patent law. Thus, while assessing novelty of the latter patent, which is, said
to be covered with a Markush structure of an earlier patent, is determined by
looking for clear, unambiguous and individual disclosures. In this behalf,
reliance was placed on Patent Office Guidelines, 2013; Patents Office Manual,
2011; Patents Office Manual, 2008; Terrel on the law of patents, 18 th
edition, Sweet & Maxwell; and Modern law of patents, 2nd Edition, Consultant
Editor - His Honor Judge Fysh, QC, SC. xv. The crux of these references is
briefly as follows. The mere possibility of an embodiment falling within the
scope or periphery of a particular claim does not mean that the particular
embodiment or compound has been disclosed with specificity. In other words, if
prior art discloses a family of compounds with a general formula, which
includes a particular compound which is not disclosed with specificity, then,
that particular compound will still constitute an invention which is novel.
xvi. The contention of the defendants that reference to the aforementioned two
patents in the working statements i.e. Form 27 filed with the Controller's
office and submissions made in the United States of America [US] for patent
term extension [PTE] as also to US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Orange
Book constitute admission is erroneous. In none of these documents, it is

Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 patent. The PTE only states that Forxiga/Farxiga
[which is the brand name for DAPA, as indicated above] is claimed by the
aforementioned patents. There is no admission whatsoever that the genus
patents i.e. IN 147 disclosed DAPA.
xvii. Assuming without admitting that these are admissions, admissions made
after the priority date of the patent cannot alter the scope of the claims
either by enlargement or reduction. [See: Glaverbel vs. British Coal, 1995 RPC
255; and F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. and Anr. vs. Cipla Ltd., MIPR 2016 (1)
0001] xviii. Likewise, the working statements i.e. Form 27 and US FDA orange
book only advert to the fact that the drug Forxiga/Farxiga work with both
genus and species patent. This is so as the genus patent, which covers DAPA,
is necessarily worked through commercialisation of the drug which was
disclosed in the species patent and, therefore, would not amount to an
admission, as alleged or at all. [See: Judgement dated 15.01.2020, passed in
CS (COMM) 561/2019, titled AstraZeneca AB & Anr. vs. Emcure Pharmaceuticals
Limited] xix. A single product may cover thousands of patents. By way of
illustration, reference was made to a mobile phone which is covered by
multiple patents. In this behalf, reliance was placed on Section 141, Section
19 and Section 91(1) of the Act. If this rationale is followed through, the
defendants are not free to make use of DAPA for manufacture and/or sale of
their product(s) until all patents containing the said compound expire. xx.
The contention that because the plaintiffs filed a "terminal disclaimer" in
the USA concerning the corresponding genus patent i.e. US 126 and species
patent i.e. US 117, the instant case was of double-patenting and ever-greening
and, therefore, the Indian species patent i.e. IN 625 stands invalidated, is
flawed. The plaintiffs had filed the species patent in the US i.e. US 117, in
2002 as a continuation-in-part of the genus patent i.e. US Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 126 to overcome the non-final double
patenting objection flagged by the US Patent Office [USPTO]. In the US, the
mere filing of a terminal disclaimer is not construed as an admission of
double patenting. It is an instance of expedient obviation rather than
obviousness. It is an often use methodology to overcome such objections raised
by USPTO. [See: Quad Environment vs. Union Sanitary, 946 F2d 870] xxi. The
defendants' contention that because the plaintiffs filed the US species patent
[US 117] as continuation-in-part of the corresponding genus patent [US 126]
and, hence, should be construed as an admission of the fact that it disclosed
no new subject matter is completely erroneous. Under the US law MPEP 201.08, a
continuation-in-part application is an application filed during the lifetime
of an earlier nonprovisional application, repeating some substantial portion
or all of the earlier nonprovisional application and adding matter not
disclosed in the said earlier nonprovisional application [See: In re Klein,
1930 C.D 2., 393, O.G. 519 (Comm'r Pat., 1930)]. The continuation-in-part
application may only be filed under 37 CFR 1.53 (b).
xxii. Furthermore, the attempt on the part of the defendants to draw a
parallel between a continuation-in-part application and an application filed
in India qua a patent for any improvement in or modification of an invention
for grant of a patent of addition is flawed. The reason being that patents of
addition as envisaged under Section 54 of the Act envisage minor improvements
over an earlier patent. In India, patents of addition are never granted where
the application claims new subject matter which was not disclosed in the prior
application. It is this conceptual difference between the application for
continuation-in-part filed in the USA and an application for grant of patents
of addition which has been missed by the defendants. It is for this reason
that the Controller of Patents in India does not scrutinize an application for
grant of patents of addition from the Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

15:05:16 point of view of lack of inventive step or obviousness when compared
with the main patent application. This aspect emerges upon a careful perusal
of Section 56 of the Act.
xxiii. The reliance by the defendants on the judgement of the Supreme Court
rendered in Novartis vs. Union of India, (2013) 6 SCC 1 [hereafter referred to
as Novartis case] is erroneous on account of the following distinguishing
features.
a) Novartis was a case where the claimed invention i.e. imatinib mesylate had
been disclosed in an earlier patent i.e. the Zimmerman patent and a finding to
that effect had been recorded by the US board of appeals.
b) It was, thus, a case where the Supreme Court found that Novartis had not
only claimed but also disclosed imatinib mesylate. The contention advanced by
Novartis that the disclosure of imatinib in the Zimmerman patent did not
involve disclosure of its invention i.e. beta crystalline form of imatinib
mesylate was rejected by the Supreme Court as there was a clear disclosure of
methane- sulphonic acid of imatinib in its patent application - a claim which
included imatinib in its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
c) In the Novartis case, the inventor himself had written articles wherein a
reference had been made to the fact that imatinib mesylate had been disclosed
in the Zimmerman patent.
d) On the other hand, there is no disclosure of DAPA in IN 147. Unlike the
Novartis case, there is no finding of any Court or tribunal to this effect.
e) The contention of Novartis that beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate
was a two-step invention i.e. from imatinib to imatinib mesylate and from
imatinib mesylate to its beta crystalline form was rejected as it was hit was
Section 3 (d) of the Act. The beta Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in

crystalline form was considered only as a polymorph which did not reveal any
enhanced therapeutic efficacy. DAPA, on the other hand, is a new compound. It
is not a salt, ester, ether, polymorph, metabolite etcetera of a known
substance and, hence, does not fall within the purview of Section 3 (d) of the
Act. Importantly, in the instant case, Dr. William N. Washburn's affidavit
[who led the group which invented the compound-in-issue] has demonstrated
DAPA's enhanced efficacy over example 12 of IN 147. In this behalf, the
following assertions have been made by Dr. Washburn. A. Enhanced ability: for
blood sugar 25%; for plasma sugar 58% and 1.7 times selective for SGLT2 over
SGLT1. B. Example 12 never morphed into a drug and had no known efficacy as it
was never tested on human beings. C. DAPA was synthesized only in 2001.
f) The aspect concerning whether a compound is covered or disclosed should be
construed as an obiter as it came up because of arguments advanced on behalf
of Novartis that there was no disclosure of imatinib mesylate in the Zimmerman
patent, although, it was covered by its broad claims.
g) The reliance placed by the defendants on paragraph 134 of the Novartis case
needs to be examined in the background of the following factors.
A. It displays a desire for the law to develop in a certain way in future.
B. There is no finding in the judgement that Markush claims are bad in law.
The Supreme Court was not concerned with this issue. There is, in fact, a
recognition by the Supreme Court in the very same paragraph that there could
be some gap between what is covered as against that which is disclosed.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 Therefore, what the defendants
submit requires not a judicial decision but a legislative interdiction. In
this behalf, it requires to be borne in mind that the Court did not rule one
way or the other on the issue: if the gap between what was disclosed and
covered was too wide, would that invalidate the patent? In other words, would
the patent become unenforceable qua compounds which are not disclosed? In any
event, in the instant case there is no gap between the genus patent and
species patent i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. In the Novartis case, public interest
was an issue as the drug manufactured by Novartis cost INR 1, 20,000 whereas
that manufactured by the defendant in that case cost INR 8, 000. The price
difference was vast. In the present case, the price difference is only INR 37
per capsule. In this context, one cannot lose sight of the fact that DAPA,
which is, used to treat diabetes is not a life-threatening disease. [See:
Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation and Ors. vs. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals,
MANU/DE/0852/2015] xxiv. Section 13 (1) (b) of the Act, which concerns the
defence of anticipation by prior claiming has no application in the instant
case as the earlier claim i.e. IN 147 and the patent claim i.e. IN 625 are not
identical. [See: Daikin Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Shingu and Another's) Application,
(1974) R.P.C. 18; and Manual of Patent Office Practice and Procedure Version
01.11 as modified on March 22, 2011] xxv. The invention of IN 147, as claimed,

xxvii. Extensive research is required to understand which linker required
research. Extensive research was also required to understand which
substitutions are required, as indicated above. Furthermore, which of the 9
carbon positions had to be substituted, also requires extensive research.
xxviii. On the other hand, IN 625 has only one specific molecule, i.e.,
Dapagliflozin. Therefore, it is clear that prior claiming has no application
to the present case.
xxix. The defence of anticipation by prior publication does not apply in this
case for the following reasons.
a) IN 147 is not prior art as it was published only on 18.03.2005, that is,
after the priority date of IN 625 which is 20.05.2002.
b) There can be no disclosure in law if a forest or a library of compounds is
encompassed by a Markush structure wherein few species are disclosed only by
way of examples. [See: Dr Reddy's Laboratories (UK) Ltd vs. Eli Lilly and Co
Ltd. (2009) EWCA 1362; In re: Petering, 301 F.2d 676; and Apotex Pty Ltd
(formerly GenRx Pty Ltd) vs Sanofi-Aventis [2008] FCA 1194] xxx. The
defendants are wrong in contending that where a genus patent is granted,
subsequent species patent cannot be granted. Unique features of breakthrough
inventions are critical and, hence, need to be protected by a Signature Not

vs. Satish Reddy and Ors., MANU/DE/1621/2019] xxxi. For the defence of
obviousness to apply, it must be demonstrated that a person with average skill
and average knowledge, who has no creative or inventive faculties, can reach
claimed inventions on reading the prior art. Thus, simply put, obviousness is
something which is claimed and easily understood by persons skilled in art. To
reach a conclusion of obviousness, the teaching contained in the document must
be read as a whole. The document must not teach away from a certain concept.
Pertinently, hindsight reconstruction is not permissible. [See: Judgement
dated 30.01.2020, passed in CS (COMM) 27/2020, titled Bristol-Myers Squibb
Holdings Ireland Unlimited Company & Ors. vs. BDR Pharmaceuticals
International Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.; and The General Tire & Rubber Company vs. The
Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited and Others, (1972) RPC 17] xxxii.
DAPA, on the other hand, is not obvious contrary to what is contended by the
defendants. The reliance of the defendants, in this behalf, on example 12 of
IN 147 is flawed. The reasons for the same are as follows:
> A. First, why should one look at example 12 when genus formula 1B has large
> number of compounds?
> B. Second, why should one look at example 12 when 80 examples are given of
> which examples 1 and 2 are synthesised on a large scale? C. Third, if
> example 12 is relevant, why is the need to change methoxy?
> D. Fourth, in any case, properties of example 12 i.e. efficacy or other data
> or SAR are not known.
> E. Fifth, the teaching of IN 147 is to add hydrogen on central phenyl ring
> [in 60 % of examples].

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 F. Sixth, there is no ethoxy on the
distal phenyl in any of the 80 examples.
G. Lastly, DAPA is far more effective than example 12. xxxiii. For defence of
obviousness to be sustained, it would have to be established that the earlier
patent was published as on the date when the latter patent was granted. In the
instant case, the admitted facts reveal that the species patent i.e. IN 625
has a priority date of 20.05.2002 whereas the genus patent was published under
Section 11A of the Act only on 18.03.2005. This being the position, there can
be no question of a person of ordinary skill in the art, having read example
12 or any other teaching in the genus patent i.e. IN 147, to arrive at DAPA.
This submission is further strengthened by the fact that the corresponding
species patent US 117 bears a priority date of 20.05.2002 while the
corresponding genus patent i.e. US 126 was published in the US only in
September 2002. xxxiv. Since there was no publication of the genus patent in
USA prior to the filing of the species patent there is no question of the
person of ordinary skill in the art of reaching DAPA by absorbing the teaching
given in example 12 or any other teaching given in the genus patent i.e. IN
147. xxxv. DAPA is not obvious because formula 1B of IN 147 has a million
possibilities. Any attempt to reach DAPA from the Markush structure of Claim 1
of IN 147 or genus formula 1B is nothing but an attempt to take recourse to
hindsight which is discouraged under patent law. xxxvi. Of the 25 examples in
IN 147 that fall within the genus of compounds of Structure IB, 13 (over 50%)
have hydrogen as R1. Of the remaining 12 examples that have non-hydrogen R1
groups, over 65% (8/12) have lower alkyls ‒ not a chloro group as in
dapagliflozin. xxxvii. Similarly, over 50% (13/25) of the examples in IN 147
that fall within the genus of compounds of Structure IB have alkyl or
thioalkyl at R4 and of the remaining Examples that fall within the genus of
compounds of Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No.

have an alkoxy at R4, none is ethoxy as in dapagliflozin.
xxxviii. Thus, given the complete absence of structure-activity data in IN
147, the large number of potential modifications of any exemplified compound
therein, the clear preference demonstrated for compounds having hydrogens on
the central phenyl ring, and the absence of any examples with an ethoxy
substituent on the distal ring, one of ordinary skill in the art would not
have had a reason or motivation to make dapagliflozin with a reasonable
expectation of success.
xxxix. It is, thus, the case of the plaintiffs that a person of ordinary skill
in the art would have to take recourse to various permutations and
combinations before it could reach DAPA. This is so as the prior art i.e. IN
147 gives no indication as to which parameters are critical or even which
direction if taken out of the many choices available would lead to success.
xl. The Court is required to take secondary factors also in account while
appreciating the defence of obviousness. In DAPA's case, the following
secondary factors need to be noticed.
A. DAPA is a drug which has attained great commercial success. B. It is the
first SGLT2 inhibitor.
C. It has been approved for treatment of hypertensive heart failure. D.
Various entities are attempting to copy the drug either by infringing or
attempting to infringe the species patent E. Had DAPA been so obvious then why
is it that no other entity has been able to develop the same. [See: Graham vs.
John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966)] xli. There is a presumption that the patent
is valid having regard to its age.
[See: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Ors. vs. J.D. Joshi and Ors.,
MANU/DE/1889/2015] Likewise, it is also settled law that if there is no
presumption of validity, there is also no presumption of invalidity of

442/2013, titled Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) vs. Mercury
Electronics & Anr.] xlii. The assertion of the defendants that the plaintiffs
have kept back information from the Controller of Patents in India concerning
corresponding foreign applications filed with USPTO is incorrect. The
plaintiffs have disclosed all material information with the Indian Patent
Office. There has been substantial compliance with the provisions of Section 8
of the Act. This is demonstrated by having regard to the following.
A. Form 3 was filed by Bristol i.e. the erstwhile owner of the patent which
was assigned to the plaintiffs only in 2014. Since then Astra Sweden has made
filings under Form 3 as required under Section 8(1) of the Act on 16.11.2004,
10.01.2005, 01.09.2009 and 17.12.2009. In these forms there is a specific
reference to the corresponding species patent granted in USA i.e. US 117.
Insofar as the Indian Patent Office was concerned an objection under Section
8(2) of the Act was raised via the first examination report dated 12.10.2007.
The patent office, thus, required the plaintiffs to provide details regarding
corresponding patents in major patent offices. Resultantly, the plaintiffs
provided documents pertaining to European Patent [EP] and the consequent grant
of patent. Furthermore, the plaintiffs on their own vide letter dated
10.01.2005 and Form 3 filings furnished documents concerning the corresponding
US patent as well. In particular, with the letter of 10.01.2005, the
plaintiffs enclosed the application for US species patent i.e. US 117 along
with its granted claims. This application revealed that it is a continuation-
in-part of the genus patent i.e. US Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

126\. As would be evident, all relevant information and material particulars
concerning the corresponding US species patent i.e. US 117 were provided to
the Indian Patent Office nearly two years before objection was raised on
12.10.2007. Thus, the assertion of the defendants that there was a concealment
is not borne out from the facts on record.
B. In any case, at the highest, errors, if any, in filing can only be
considered as inadvertent which perhaps occurred as an oversight. These errors
cannot be construed as material suppression given the conduct of the
plaintiffs. There has been no failure on part of the plaintiffs to comply with
the mandatory requirement. The allegation of the defendants that there has
been a failure to comply with the provisions of Section 8 of the Act is
ultimately a matter of trial. [See: Judgement dated 07.11.2014, passed in FAO
(OS) No. 16/2014, titled Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl & Anr. vs. Koninklijke
Phillips Electronics; and F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. and Anr. vs. Cipla Ltd.,
MIPR 2016 (1) 0001] xliii. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants should
be denied the relief of injunction for the following reasons.
A. The defendants are either manufacturing or intending to manufacture DAPA
and, therefore, infringement is admitted. B. DAPA is a man-made drug which is
used for treating not only type-2 diabetes but is also approved for treating
hypertensive heart failure in 2020.
C. The species patent is an old and established patent and, therefore, carried
with it the presumption of validity. This patent is in its 18 th year of life
cycle.

to examination by the Indian Patent Office for seven years i.e. between 2002
[the year of priority] and 2009 [the year of grant].
E. Both genus and species patent have not been subjected to any pre- grant or
post grant opposition or even subjected to revocation proceedings up until
2020. Proceedings filed in 2020 are mala fide, counter-blast or peremptory
strikes against patent infringement suit actions filed by the plaintiffs.
F. The defendants have not conducted any research and development and,
therefore, want to piggyback the inventions of the plaintiffs concerning DAPA.
G. The plaintiffs have been selling the products under various brand names
since 2015, both, directly and/or through their distributors i.e. Sun and
Abbott at reasonable prices.
H. Insofar as the defendant in CS (COMM) 410/2020 is concerned, the plaintiffs
have acquired knowledge from their investigator that it was planning to launch
its product using the DAPA compound. Although, the defendants before this
Court, on 01.10.2020, stated that they have not commenced manufacture of their
drug, that may not be quite correct. The defendants being aware of the fact
that the plaintiffs have been granted a patent for DAPA should have the way
cleared for proceeding further with their manufacturing and/or selling
activities by adopting any one of the following routes. ▪ Seek a voluntary
license.
▪ Seek a compulsory license.
▪ Filing revocations.
▪ Filing a pre-grant or a post-grant opposition. ▪ File a declaratory action
for non-infringement.

appropriate stage could have also filed pre or post-grant opposition; a step
that they did not take. [See: Eisai Co. Ltd. and Ors. vs. Satish Reddy and
Ors., MANU/DE/1621/2019; and Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation and Ors. vs.
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, MANU/DE/0852/2015.] J. For the aforesaid routes to
be taken, the defendants had 15 years at their disposal since both patents
were published under Section 11A of the Act in 2005. Likewise, if the date of
grant is taken the defendants had available to them 13 and 11 years since the
registration of the genus patent i.e. IN 147 and the species patent i.e. IN
625 respectively.
K. The plaintiffs have filed several suit actions in which interim injunctions
have been granted by this court.
L. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, given what is stated above, the
defendants have failed to make out a prima facie case and the balance of
convenience is also titled against them. M. Plaintiffs will suffer an
irreparable loss if injunction, as prayed, is not granted as it will destroy
the market for them whereas, insofar as the defendants are concerned, the
launch of their product will only be postponed. Furthermore, since 3 companies
i.e. Eris Life Sciences, USV and Zydus have already launched their infringing
products, despite suits filed against them, which are pending adjudication,
the market has already been flooded with the infringing products.
N. Besides this, medical practitioners have expressed concerns as to what
would be the ultimate quality of the drug if the defendants are permitted to
launch their products. Damages caused by the Signature Not I.A.Verified No.

Their victory has to be real and not pyrrhic. [See: Merck Sharp and Dohme

a nutshell, the defendants should be restrained from infringing plaintiffs'
species patent i.e. IN 625 during the pendency of the suit action.
On behalf of the defendants: -
7\. There were joint-arguments addressed on behalf of the defendants [to avoid

Senior Advocate, Mr. Adarsh Ramanujam and Mr. J Sai Deepak. The written
submissions were also circulated by these counsels having regard to the same.
Pertinently, Mr. J Sai Deepak had advanced arguments on behalf of Emcure
Pharmaceuticals Limited [in short "Emcure"] in CS (COMM) No. 407/2020. Given
the development, concerning CS (COMM) No. 407/2020, Mr. Vaidyanathan and Mr.
Ramanujam stated that they would adopt the legal submissions made by Mr. Sai
Deepak apart from what had been argued by them to avoid repetition.

advanced on behalf of the defendants.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 i. The plaintiffs cannot be
permitted to take mutually destructive pleas. The plaintiffs, having alleged
that manufacture and/or sale etcetera of DAPA infringes IN 147 i.e. the genus
patent, it stands to reason that the said compound stands fully and
particularly described in IN 147 i.e. the genus patent; this being a mandatory
requirement of Section 10(4)(a) read with Section 10(4)(c) of the Act.
ii. Strangely, when defendants cite IN 147 [i.e. the genus patent] as prior
art or prior published document to invalidate the species patent [i.e. IN
625], the plaintiffs aver that DAPA, though covered/claimed, is not disclosed
in IN 147 i.e. the genus patent. If this assertion of the plaintiffs is
accepted, then, it is quite clear that they would fall foul of the provisions
of Section 10(5) of the Act.
iii. Insofar as the defendants are concerned, since they have not manufactured
DAPA [a statement which was made on the first date of hearing i.e.
01.10.2020]; there cannot be any infringement by them of IN 147 i.e. the genus
patent.
iv. The plaintiffs have averred that there is a reasonable apprehension of the
defendants manufacturing DAPA without producing any tenable material on
record. What is, however, admitted by the plaintiffs is that the defendants
have not launched their product containing DAPA. Since IN 147 i.e. the genus
patent, admittedly, expired on 02.10.2020, there is no case of grant of
injunction qua IN 147 i.e. the genus patent in the future.
v. There is no case for grant of injunction qua IN 625 as the defendants have
raised a credible challenge as to its validity. The Statute i.e. Section 13(4)
of the Act makes that amply clear. [See: Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam vs.
Hindustan Metal Industries, (1979) 2 SCC 511] Signature Not I.A.Verified No.

Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 vi. This Court should, therefore, evaluate as to
whether or not defendants have established a credible challenge to the
validity of IN 625. In this behalf, the defendants are only required to
demonstrate that IN 625 is vulnerable to challenge and/or there is an issue
which requires trial. [See: Hoffman La Roche vs. Cipla, 2009 (110) DRJ 452
(DB)] vii. IN 625 i.e. the species patent is vulnerable to challenge under the
provisions of Section 64(1)(a), (e) and (f) of the Act. The test, however, to
be applied vis-à-vis the provisions of Section 64(1)(a) and the other two
sections i.e. 64(1)(e) and (f) are different. While the provisions of Section
64(1)(a) requires comparison of claims, insofar as Section 64(1)(e) and (f)
are concerned, a broader assessment is to be made as to what is "publicly
known or used in India" and/or what was "published in India or elsewhere".
viii. Clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 64 of the Act was adopted from a
pari materia provision contained in Section 32 (1) (a) of the UK Patents Act,
1949 which reads thus:
"32. Revocation of patent by court (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act,
a patent may, on the petition of any person interested, be revoked by the
court on any of the following grounds, that is to say, --
(a)that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
specification, was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained
in the complete specification of another patent granted in the United Kingdom;
....."
ix. Interestingly, while India has retained subclause (a) of subsection (1) of
Section 64, in UK, in the 1977 enactment, Section 32(1) has not been retained.
However, interpretation accorded by the English courts to Section 32(1)(a) is
that the Court is required to assess whether the subsequent patent seeks to
re-monopolise something which already stands protected. [See: Merck & Co
(Macek's) Patent, [1966] F.S.R. 381]. Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

Signed  411/2020 Page 25 of 84 By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020
15:05:16 x. In this context, it is necessary to bear in mind the admissions
made by the plaintiffs that DAPA is already claimed in IN 147 [See: plaint
paragraphs 36 and 86 of the plaint in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020]; and statements
made in the US litigation and the contents of Form 27 filed in IN 147]. Form
27 constitutes working statement which has to be read in the context of
Section 146 (2) and Section 10(4)(c) of the Act.
xi. The fact that DAPA is prior claimed in IN 147 is apparent by the conduct
of the plaintiffs while pursuing their patent applications before USPTO. The
record would show that the plaintiffs' US patent application i.e. US 117 which
is equivalent to IN 625, when objected to on the ground of prior claiming i.e.
"obviousness-type double patenting", it was resolved by the plaintiffs filing
a terminal disclaimer. Such a step taken by the plaintiffs would be a clue
that the patentee did not consider IN 625 to be distinct from IN 147. In any
case, it raises a credible challenge to the validity of IN 625 under Section
64(1)(a) of the Act.
xii. IN 625 is vulnerable to challenge also because it is anticipated by what
is published or publicly known from IN 147. In this behalf, the following
dates and events need to be borne in mind.
A. IN 147 was first published on 19.04.2001, whereas, the priority date of IN
625 is 20.05.2002.
B. Since the plaintiffs, while filing their specification qua IN 147, have
claimed as also fully and particularly described the same in IN 147, DAPA
would be publicly known in India. The expression "publicly known" will
necessary mean that patented invention is known to persons who are engaged in
the pursuit of knowledge concerning the patented product. Such persons would
inter alia be men of science. [See: Monsanto Company v. Coromandel Indag
Products, (1986) 1 SCC 642] Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS

xiii. The Supreme Court in Novartis case dealt with the expression "known"
> in the context of Section 3(d) of the Act. In that case, the Supreme Court
> rejected the argument that there was a dichotomy between coverage and
> disclosure. In that case, the Supreme Court was called upon to rule whether

> circumstance that DAPA is also known from IN 147.
xiv. Without prejudice to the contentions made hereinabove, IN 625 is also
vulnerable to challenge as it lacks inventive step based on what was published
or publicly known from IN 147. [In this behalf, See: Section 64(1)(f) and
Section 2 (1) (ja) of the Act].
xv. Inventive step requires an assessment of two aspects as per the provisions
of Section 2(1)(ja) and both aspects/conditions are conjunctive in nature.
First, the invention should involve "technical advance" as compared to
existing knowledge or have economic significance. Second, the invention should
not be obvious to the person skilled in art. A new product, which does not
involve inventive step as per the condition stipulated in Section 2 (1) (ja)
and is not capable of industrial application, falls foul of Section 64 (1)
(f).

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 xvi. The term technical advance was
borrowed from German law which requires IN 625 to demonstrate technical
superiority over IN 147. IN 625 does not state that DAPA is superior to the
compound adverted to in IN 147 with reference to any property. [See: Toshiko
Takenaka (ed.), Patent Law and Theory: A Handbook of Contemporary Research
(Edward Elgar, 2008)] Importantly, for the person skilled in the art, IN 625
simply denotes that DAPA will have the same function as compounds of IN 147
i.e. SGLT2 inhibition activity.
xvii. Furthermore, IN 625 does not set out the economic significance over
compounds of IN 147. Consequently, IN 625 fails the inventive step requirement
as there is failure to demonstrate technical advance or economic significance
which was not previously known from IN 147.
xviii. Besides this [and without prejudice to what is stated hereinabove, that
is, IN 625 fails the test of inventive step], DAPA is obvious to a person
skilled in art from IN 147 if the five-step analysis as laid down in F.
Hoffman-La Roche vs. Cipla Ltd., 2015 (225) DLT 391 is followed.
A. Step 1 requires the identification of the person skilled in the art. Such a
person would be [in the context of the present case] a person who is a PhD in
medical or organic chemistry with a few years' experience in drug development.
He would also be a person of ordinary creativity, although, not an automaton
but at the same time would not be inventive. He would have the ability to make
workshop improvement modification furthering the stage of knowledge. He will
also be someone who would read all relevant literature carefully and with
sufficient interest to be in a position to apply his mind to practical
application. Plaintiffs have failed to identify such a person.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 B. Step 2, in this case, doesn't
require further enquiry as the only inventive concept is the compound DAPA.
C. Step 3 requires an input of a person skilled in the art having common
general knowledge. The independent expert, in this case, Dr. Stephen F. Martin
has stated that methyl and ethyl being homologues possessing similar
properties can routinely involve substitution of methyl group with ethyl group
in organic chemistry; being common general knowledge.
D. Step 4 involves identification of differences between inventive concepts
and prior knowledge. The defendants contend that there is no difference
between the two in the instant case as DAPA has been disclosed as one of the
most preferred structure in IN 147 patent. This is so, in view of structure I
(B) and preferred definitions of alkyl and halogen in IN 147. Alternatively,
according to the defendants, the best scenario for the plaintiffs is that IN
625 differs from IN 147 on account of methyl vs. ethyl substitution or methoxy
vs. ethoxy substitution when example 12 of IN 147 is compared with DAPA.
However, as per the expert i.e. Dr. Martin; this is a matter of common general
knowledge for the person skilled in the art and, therefore, this distinction
cannot be used to justify that IN 625 involves an inventive step.
E. Step 5: To decide whether those differences viewed in the knowledge of the
alleged invention constituted steps which would have been obvious to the
person skilled in the art without taking recourse to hindsight wisdom.
xix. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, the plaintiffs' contention that the
defendants must demonstrate as to why one must select DAPA from Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 infinite compounds of IN 147 or isolate
example 12 as the starting point or what would motivate substitution of methyl
group with ethyl group especially when there are unexpected benefits as
suggested by the affidavit of Dr. Washburn, is flawed, due to the following
reasons.
A. Such an argument that an inventive step arises due to a selection from
purported infinite compound was rejected both in the European Union (EU) and
the United Kingdom (UK) [See: AgrEvo UK Limited, Case Number T 0938/92 -3.3.1
which was approved by The United Kingdom Supreme Court in Actavis Group PTC
EHF and others vs. ICOS Corporation and another, [2019] UKSC 15] The
observation therein was that even if prior art comprises of an infinite number
of starting point every such prior art is deemed to be suggestive to the
person skilled in the art. It went on to state that a mere arbitrary selection
of one or more compounds from a laundry list in the prior art cannot itself
confer inventive step. The only exception to this is where the patentee is
able to fulfil two conditions.
▪ The identification/selection is based on an "unknown technical effect".
▪ This unknown technical effect must be justified by difference in structure
between the identified/selected compound and the rest of the molecules from
the prior art.
B. IN 625 fails on both counts. It neither discloses unknown technical effect
not does it justify such unknown technical effect by reference to substitution
with methyl group at one location. It simply states that DAPA has the same
activity/utility as the compounds of IN 147 which is a known technical effect.

By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 attempt of the plaintiffs
to overcome this fatal error by relying on Dr. Washburn's affidavit will not
shore up their case for the following reasons.
a) This affidavit was sworn in April 2020 and was placed before the Court for
the first time on 12.10.2020. Dr. Washburn's affidavit did not form part of IN
625 from its inception and most certainly did not exist on its priority date
i.e. 20.05.2002. This submission, though, is made dehors the stand of the
defendants concerning credibility and the veracity of the data relied upon in
Dr. Washburn's affidavit.
b) The plaintiffs could have relied upon such data post the priority date only
if the specification itself "plausibly demonstrated" such unknown technical
effect. This is so because the validity of the patent is to be assessed on its
priority date. IN 625 does not state, let alone plausibly demonstrate, such
unknown technical effect, on its priority date. [See: Generics (UK) Limited
vs. Yeda Research and Development Co. Limited, (2014) R.P.C. 4] xx. Without
prejudice to the above, it requires to be noticed that DAPA would be obvious
to the person skilled in the art on account of the manner in which he would
appreciate the contents of IN 147. Reliance by the plaintiffs on the judgement
rendered in In re Petering, 301 F.2d 676, in fact, supports the submissions of
the defendants. This judgement holds that even a prior art disclosure of an
infinite number of molecules would be construed by a person skilled in the art
in a logical manner to filter down to a smaller class of compound if the
document itself lays out series of specific preferences which allows him to
envisage a smaller class of Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS

compounds. The submissions advanced by the plaintiffs seem to suggest that a
person skilled in the art does not have ordinary intelligence but is a
dullard. The instant case presents, precisely, this situation which is
captured in In re Petering.
xxi. Without prejudice to the above, it is submitted that IN 625 is vulnerable
to challenge because of the plaintiffs having breached the provisions of
Section 8 of the Act and, hence, had opened IN 625 to revocation under Section
64(1)(m). The requirements of Section 8 are mandatory. The provisions of this
section oblige the applicant to keep the Indian Patent Office informed about
the status of all corresponding foreign patent applications, which are filed
in respect of the same or substantially the same invention qua which patent is
sought.
xxii. Under the provisions of Section 8, the applicant is required to disclose
details with regard to grant, refusal or abandonment of any foreign
application. Subsection (1) of Section 8 requires an applicant to file, on its
own, all material particulars including office actions and examination reports
issued by foreign patent offices. This obligation becomes inescapable under
subsection (2) of Section 8 where the patent examiner calls for information
concerning examination report and office action issued by foreign patent
offices.
xxiii. In the instant case, the plaintiffs supressed the office
actions/examination reports dated 30.07.2002 issued by the USPTO concerning US
117 which corresponds to IN 625. In the said examination report, the USPTO had
expressly found, in relation to US 117, that the subject matter claimed
therein was fully disclosed in US 126 which corresponds to IN 147. In this
context, it is important to note that the plaintiffs, via their response dated
19.08.2002, voluntarily offered to limit the term of US 117 Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 [equivalent to IN 625] to that of US 126
[equivalent to IN 147] which expired on 04.10.2020. The methodology adopted,
which, in USA, is known as a "terminal disclaimer", prevented the rejection of
application preferred for grant of US 117 on the ground of obviousness and
double patenting.
xxiv. US 117 was granted on 20.09.2002 by the USPTO only upon acceptance of
the terminal disclaimer offered by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs ought to
have disclosed, on their own, the said information in consonance with Section
8(1) of the Act. The plaintiffs did not do so. The plaintiffs failed to
furnish this information even when the Indian Patent Office, vide its first
examination report [FER] dated 12.10.2007, issued in relation to IN 625,
sought the information. [See: Serial no. 13 of FER dated 12.10.2007] The
plaintiffs, instead, furnished copies of the European patent. [See: Plaintiffs
response dated 08.10.2008] The plaintiffs' response that since the patent in
the USA had already been granted, there was no statutory obligation cast on
them under Section 8 of the Act to submit office actions issued by USPTO, is
contrary to the intent of Section 8 [See: Chemtura Corporation vs. Union of
India (UOI) and Ors., 2009 (41) PTC260(Del)] xxv. The assertion of the
plaintiffs that they had furnished the information concerning the
corresponding US patent along with their letter of 10.01.2005 is incorrect
since the said letter did not enclose either the non- final rejection letter
issued by USPTO dated 30.07.2002 or the terminal disclaimer dated 19.07.2002.
This omission was deliberate. The omission was material as it would have
alerted the Indian Patent Office to raise a prior claiming objection which
would have constrained the patentee to amend IN 625 to a patent of addition
under Section 54 of the Act. In other Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

15:05:16 words, IN 625 would, then, have a validity period which would
terminate with the tenure of IN 147 i.e. 02.10.2020.
xxvi. The submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs that termination
disclaimer is only an obviation and not an admission of obviousness/double
patenting based on the judgement rendered in Quad Environment vs. Union
Sanitary, 946 F2d 870 does not appear to be in line with the current thinking
in USA. [See: Festo Corp. vs. Shoketsu Kinzoku, 535 U.S 722 (2002); and
SimpleAir, Inc. vs. Google LLC, Appeal Number: 16-2738, United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit].
xxvii. The admissions made in the plaint, in at least 18 paragraphs, i.e.
paragraph numbers 2, 3, 16, 22, 26, 28, 53, 54, 56, 70, 71, 73, 76, 77, 79,
83, 84, 87, 88 and the prayer clause [i.e. 101] that DAPA is covered by both
suit patents would propel the Court to dismiss the interlocutory application
in view of the express language of Section 53(4) and Section 13(1)(b) and
Section 64(1) of the Act. In support of this plea, that is, DAPA is covered by
the claims made in the genus patent i.e. IN 147 reference is also made to Form
27 filed by the plaintiffs between 2015- 2019 with the Indian Patent Office in
relation to IN 147. Form 27 supports the plea of the defendants that even
according to the plaintiffs DAPA is covered by IN 147.
xxviii. Besides this, a perusal of PTE applications dated 06.03.2014 filed for
the corresponding patents i.e. US 117 and US 126 would show that the
plaintiffs have identified the "approved product" for which the PTE was being
sought as Farxiga [the generic name being DAPA]. It is emphasised that while
PTE of US 117 was filed by the plaintiffs, the similar application i.e. PTE
dated 06.03.2014 qua US 126 was kept back. Signature Not I.A.Verified No.

Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 xxix. In this context, it was submitted that the PTE
filed in respect of US 126 inter alia states at internal page 12 that claims
1-8 and 14-28 "read on" the product DAPA. This clearly demonstrates that even
according to the plaintiffs DAPA is covered by US 126 and, therefore, is also
covered by Indian genus patent i.e. IN 147. It is in the backdrop of these PTE
applications that USPTO required the plaintiffs to elect, between one of the
two patents for grant of PTE vide its final notice of election dated
15.06.2020. The record would show that on 10.07.2020 plaintiffs elected US 117
and, therefore, US 117 was granted PTE. It is also relevant to note that
before US FDA, qua US 126 along with other US patents, the plaintiffs have
stated that it covers DAPA which, by logical corollary, would also stand
covered by IN 147.
xxx. In this context, it is important to note the plaintiffs stand vis-à-vis
an entity going by the name Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, in an action filed by
them against the said entity in the District Court of Delaware, wherein, one
of the patents asserted was US 126 [equivalent to IN 147]. In paragraphs 28,
29, and 31 to 33 of the complaint which was the subject matter of the
aforementioned action, it is averred that Zydus Pharmaceutical USA's
application to the US FDA to market DAPA tablets would infringe at least
claims 1 and 26 of US 126 if approval is granted before the expiry of the said
patent. It is important to bear in mind that Claim 1 of US 126 is identical to
Claim 1 of IN 147 and claim 26 of IN 147 claims the same structure as Claim 27
of US 126.
xxxi. Given these admissions, not only should the interlocutory application be
dismissed but also the suit as no trial would be required. These admissions
trigger the bar contained in Section 53 (4) of the Act which inter alia states
that on expiry of the term of the patent, the subject matter covered by the
said patent shall not be entitled to any protection. The Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 admissions in the plaint and other documents
show that DAPA is covered by IN 147 which expired on 02.10.2020 and,
therefore, no further protection can be given to DAPA through the route of the
species patent i.e. IN 625.
xxxii. Section 53(4) which was introduced in the Act pursuant to the 2002
amendment sought to protect abuse by the patentee of its monopoly rights by
resorting to double patenting. It is in this context that extension of
protection of subject matter which is covered by an expired patent is not
countenanced by the Statute.
xxxiii. Section 53(4) along with Section 107A of the Act was introduced to
balance the interest of public in lieu of extension of patent term to 20 years
for patents across the board for all inventions. Section 107A, in this spirit,
facilitates timely entry of generic drugs by exempting certain activities such
as research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals from the pale
of infringement actions. The purpose being that manufacturers of generic drugs
should be in a position to commence their activities immediately upon the
expiry of the patent in the interest of the public at large. These statutory
safeguards were put in place to balance its international commitment under the
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights [in short
"TRIPS agreement"] as against India's obligation to protect the health of its
citizens. [See: Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and Public Health
dated 14.11.2001].
xxxiv. In this context, it was emphasized that when Section 13(1)(b) is read
with Section 64(1)(a) of the Act, it would show that it allows the examiner to
invoke anticipatory prior art even where the claim made in another complete
specification filed in India is dated before or has a priority date Signature

matter is the same.
A. In other words, unlike other grounds of anticipation which require prior
publication of documents sought to be used as anticipatory prior art Section
13(1)(b) makes an exception. There is, in fact, no statutory exception or
defence provided to anticipation by prior claiming. Therefore, once it is
established [and, in this case, admitted by the plaintiffs] that DAPA is
covered by the claims of genus patent IN 147, the plaintiffs cannot be heard
to say that anticipation by prior claiming is not established under Section
64(1)(a) of the Act since DAPA, while being covered by the claims of IN 147
only because it is not disclosed by the said patent.
B. It is important to note that for a defendant to establish prior claiming,
it is not important to show that the prior art contained in the prior patent
is identical to the impugned claim in the impugned patent. All that the
defendant has to establish is that the subject matter claimed that the
impugned patent falls within the scope or is covered by the prior claim of the
prior patent. In the facts of the instant case since the prior claim of IN 147
such as 1, 14 to 26 being broader, encompass within their scope, the entire
principal claim of the impugned patent i.e. IN 625, it renders the entire
principal claim of IN 625 vulnerable to revocation.
C. Significantly, Section 64(1)(a) read with Section 13(1)(b) of the Act only
requires coverage of the subject matter by a prior claim, there being no
requirement of disclosure whatsoever. This, though, is without prejudice to
the submission of the defendants that DAPA is, in fact, disclosed in IN 147.
If this position is held to be true, Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

15:05:16 then, the stand taken by the plaintiff that DAPA is covered but not
disclosed will not help its cause. In this regard, it has to be borne in mind
that Section 11 of the Act requires that every claim of a patent is based on a
matter which is fairly disclosed.
xxxv. In the instant case, preferred embodiments leading to DAPA form
structure claimed in claims 1, 14, 15 and 26 are expressly set out in internal
pages 29 and 33 of the complete specification of IN 147 wherein ethyl for the
alkyl group and chlorine for halogen are specifically captured as most
preferred embodiments. Therefore, not only is DAPA covered by claims of IN
147, as is admitted by the plaintiffs, the said claims are, as indicated
above, supported by the disclosure of the specification.
xxxvi. IN 625 is also vulnerable on the ground of prior publication. This is
evident if one were to read section 64(1)(e) along with Section 13(2) of the
Act. In the instant case, IN 625 is liable to be revoked on the ground of lack
of novelty due to prior publication of WO2001/27128 [in short "WO'128"] which
is the PCT equivalent of the genus patent IN 147. WO'128 was published on
19.04.2001 whereas the priority date of IN 625 admittedly is 20.05.2002.
xxxvii. A careful perusal of WO'128 with IN 625 would show that the written
description qua the background of respective purported inventions is
identical. A perusal of the detailed description of two documents would also
show that in large swathes they are identical and is, therefore, a classic
case of cut, copy, paste. Besides this, the description of preferred
embodiments substituents possible combinations with other pharmaceutical
ingredients and suggestive doses are all identical. What is ironical and also
similar is: that there is a complete absence of any Signature Not I.A.Verified

containing purportedly novel compounds in either document. There is, in both
documents, a complete absence of any data relating to efficacy let alone
significant enhancement of efficacy or indeed any activity whatsoever.
xxxviii. The balance of convenience is in favour of the defendants since they
would be manufacturing their drug in India which would generate employment and
align with the policies of Government of India i.e. Make in India. The
plaintiffs, on the other hand, would be importing their product for marketing
in India.
xxxix. The plaintiffs are guilty of misrepresentation and concealment. The
plaintiffs have concealed relevant facts from the Indian Patent Office at the
time of filing patent application for IN 625 including the following.
▪ The plaintiffs already hold a valid patent which discloses the sale compound
i.e. DAPA;
▪ As per the plaintiffs' own admission, IN 625 is part of a catalogue of
patents including IN 147, therefore, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to
disclose the same to the examiner ▪ The Plaintiffs have failed to disclose
material particulars of their corresponding US patents which is violative of
Section 8(2) of the Act.
▪ The plaintiffs failed to disclose the non-final rejection letter issued by
USPTO dated 30.07.2002 and the terminal disclaimer dated 19.07.2002 field in
response thereto to the said objection.
xl. The plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate irreparable injury. Irreparable
injury is understood to be an injury which is not monetarily compensable.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 There is no presumption qua
irreparable injury where the validity of a patent has not been tested in
litigation. [See: Nutrition 21 vs. The United States of America, US 930 F.2d
867] This principal is important for cases in India as there is no presumption
of validity in India as provided in Section 13(4) of the Act.
xli. There are at least two entities i.e. Sun and Abbott which have obtained a
license qua IN 625. The packaging of the two products which are used by Sun
and Abbott establish this fact. Therefore, the plaintiffs, clearly, have not
sought market exclusivity but have shown willingness to monetise the patent
via licensing. The logical sequitur of this would be that the royalty payable
by the aforementioned licensees could provide a reasonable basis to assess the
damages if the plaintiffs were to finally succeed in the instant actions.
[See: Polymer Technologies, Inc. vs. Bridwell, 103 F.3d 970, 974
(Fed.Cir.1996); T.J. Smith and Nephew Ltd. vs. Consolidated Medical Equip.
Inc., 821 F.2d 646; and Dynamic Mfg. Inc. vs. Craze, No. 97-1165, 1998 WL
241201] xlii. The defendants being large enterprises who possess financial
wherewithal and are not fly by night operators would be able to pay damages if
proved under the law.
xliii. Furthermore, without prejudice to the contentions made hereinabove,
interim injunction ought to be denied to the plaintiffs given the
considerations of the public interest.
xliv. The plaintiffs and their aforementioned licensees [i.e. Sun and Abbott]
are marketing DAPA under various brand names such as FORXIGA, XIGDUO, OXRA,
GLADEPA and various fixed dose combinations at Rs. 54.4 for a 5-milligram dose
and Rs. 57.29 for a 10-milligram dose. Thus, a strip of 14 tablets would cost,
qua the aforesaid dosages, between Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in

761.60 and Rs. 802.90 respectively. The cost per patient vis-à-vis plaintiffs'
drug in the market would range approximately between Rs. 1523.20 and Rs.
1605.80. As against this, the defendants propose to sell their drugs for Rs.
13.90 for 5-milligram and Rs. 17.50 for a 10-milligram dose. Thus, a strip
comprising of 14 tablets would have a price range of Rs. 194.60 and Rs. 245
respectively. Thus, the drugs manufactured by the defendants would lay a
financial burden on a patient that would range between Rs. 490 and 554.50 per
month. The difference in percentage would be approximately 250%.

prevalent, the probability of a diabetic person being afflicted with the virus
is exponentially high.
Rejoinder arguments on behalf of the plaintiffs: -
9\. In the rejoinder, the plaintiffs were led by Mr. Harish Salve, learned
senior counsel, who addressed arguments, in some detail, with regard to two
aspects:
a. First, the true and correct ratio of the Novartis judgement. b. Second, the
applicability of Section 53(4) of the Act to the instant case.
10\. In respect of the first aspect, Mr. Salve drew my attention to various
paragraphs of the Novartis judgement to demonstrate that the said judgement
concerned, essentially, the applicability and interpretation of Section 3(d)
of the Act [along with the explanation appended thereto] in the context of
facts obtaining in that case. It was sought to be pointed out by Mr. Salve
that Novartis before the Supreme Court had inter alia contended that beta
crystalline imatinib mesylate was a new invention qua which there were no
teachings in the earlier patent i.e. the Zimmerman patent.
Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020 & I.A. No.
8859/2020 in CS (COMM) No. Digitally Signed  411/2020 Page 41 of 84 By:VIPIN
KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 10.1 It was pointed out that
Novartis had argued that while imatinib-in-free- base was claimed in the
Zimmerman patent, there were no teachings in the Zimmerman patent on how to
prepare imatinib mesylate from the former and that there was no mention of
polymorphism or crystalline structure in the said patent.
10.2 Mr. Salve endeavoured to demonstrate that it was, in this context, that
one of the arguments, which was advanced on behalf of Novartis was that while
imatinib mesylate was covered by the Zimmerman patent, it was not disclosed
therein and that coverage or claim in a patent was distinct from the
disclosure made in a patent.
10.3 In other words, the boundary laid out by the claim for coverage is
permitted to be wider than disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent.
It was sought to be pointed out that in Novartis case, on facts, the Supreme
Court found that the US Board of Patent Appeals had noticed that the Zimmerman
patent taught the person skilled in the art how to use imatinib - a compound
of formulae 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a
pharmaceutical composition for treating tumours or a method of treating warm-
blooded animals suffering from a tumoral disease.
10.4 Apart from this, as pointed out by Mr. Salve, the Supreme Court had also
noticed the fact that in an article published in a journal going by the name
Cancer Research and Nature Medicine [which was co-authored by several persons
including Jurg Zimmerman], there was a detailed discussion about anti- tumoral
properties of imatinib and its methanesulfonate salt i.e. imatinib mesylate.
My attention was drawn also to the fact that the Court noticed yet another
article published in the aforementioned journal in which there was a
discussion about imatinib designed to inhibit Abl Protein-Tyrosine Kinase in
Vitro and in Vivo by a 2-phenulaminopyrimidine derivative. Signature Not

CS (COMM) No. Digitally Signed  411/2020 Page 42 of 84 By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI
Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 10.5 Mr. Salve, thus, submitted that it was
in this background that the Supreme Court concluded that imatinib mesylate was
not a new product and that it was a known substance seen in the Zimmerman
patent. Furthermore, Mr. Salve pointed out that the Supreme Court said that
for imatinib mesylate to be construed as a new product i.e. an invention it
should have features which involved technical advance over existence knowledge
and would make invention not obvious to the person skilled in the art.
10.6 In short, Mr. Salve submitted that the observations made in paragraphs
118 and 119 of the Novartis case concerning coverage and disclosure have to be
understood in this context. According to Mr. Salve, what was emphasized was
that Novartis was not able to prove inter alia therapeutic efficacy of its
claimed invention. It was emphasized that what the Court disapproved was,
perhaps, clever drafting of descriptions and specifications which, then, are
used as a ploy to extend the validity period of the patent.
10.7 According to Mr. Salve, the Court did not do away with the Markush
structure which is what the plaintiffs are relying upon in the instant case
and that this aspect is evident if one were to carefully peruse the
observations made in paragraph 134 of the Novartis case.
10.8 As regards, Section 53(4) of the Act, Mr. Salve contended that it had no
application to the facts obtaining in the instant case.
11\. Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned senior counsel, in rejoinder, concentrated on
the aspects concerning balance of convenience apart from what was stated in
the opening by him which was recorded in my order dated 01.10.2020.
12\. Mr. Anand also made submissions in rejoinder and submitted an additional
note of written submissions to counter the arguments raised by the defendants
and also distinguish the judgements cited by the defendants in Signature Not

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 support of their case.
Analysis and reasons: -
13\. I have heard the matter, at some length, on 9 dates running into several
hours. Counsels on both sides have relied upon a plethora of documents,
pleadings, written submissions and judgements in support of their respective
stand. I have attempted to capture the significant parts of the submissions
advanced on both sides.
13.1 To my mind, what is important, at this juncture, is to bear in mind the
stage of the proceedings and, therefore, contextualise the submissions and
pleadings bearing this aspect in mind.
14\. Given this backdrop, let me begin by noticing certain facts over which
there is no dispute.
i. First, the actions concern two patents i.e. the genus patent i.e. IN 147
and the species patent i.e. IN 625.
ii. Second, the aforementioned patents have corresponding patents in the USA
i.e. US 126 [which is the genus patent] and US 117 [which is the species
patent] iii. Third, the Indian genus patent i.e. IN 147 expired on 02.10.2020.
iv. The Indian species patent i.e. IN 625 expires on 15.05.2023.
v. The prayers made in the suit actions including the captioned interlocutory
applications seek injunction against purported infringement of not only IN 147
but also of IN 625. The suit actions were filed on 30.09.2020 i.e. two days
prior to expiry of validity period of IN 147 which, as indicated above, ended
on 02.10.2020.
vi. Before the USPTO, the plaintiffs filed a terminal disclaimer which, in
sum, meant that the validity period of the corresponding US patent i.e.
Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020 & I.A. No.
8859/2020 in CS (COMM) No. Digitally Signed  411/2020 Page 44 of 84 By:VIPIN
KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 US 126 [US genus patent] and US 117
[US species patent] would end on the same date. The terminal disclaimer was
filed by the plaintiffs as an objection had been raised by the USPTO qua non-
obviousness/double patenting. The plaintiffs, of course, claim that such
applications are filed in the normal course in the USA to obviate objections
raised by the USPTO and that this step cannot be construed as an admission of
the objection qua obviousness and double patenting raised by USPTO.
vii. Apart from the plaintiffs, DAPA is being marketed with the permission of
the plaintiffs by two entities namely Sun and Abbott. The brand names, under
which DAPA is being marketed, are FORXIGA, XIGDUO, OXRA, GLADEPA. The
defendants claim that Sun and Abbott are plaintiffs' licensees whereas the
plaintiffs assert that these entities are only their distributors. This fact
is noted only in the context of the argument advanced that damages if any
caused, are compensable. This aspect of the matter will be discussed by me in
the latter part of the judgement.
15\. Thus, given the aforesaid broad points of reference, it would be
important to deal, in the very first instance, with the issue as to whether or
not, at this stage, I am required to ascertain the validity of IN 625 by
conducting a mini- trial. In other words, would it suffice from the
defendants' point of view, given the fact that the actions are at the stage
where the plaintiffs are seeking a preliminary injunction, to demonstrate that
they have raised a credible challenge to IN 625?
15.1 In this context, on behalf of the defendants, it was argued that a patent
is valid only till such time it is challenged and, therefore, there is no
presumption as to its validity. It was emphasized that a challenge could be
raised both, at the pre and post-grant of a patent, and also by way of
revocation or counter-claim. 15.2 The plaintiffs, on the other hand, have
sought to bring to fore the fact that Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020
in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020 & I.A. No. 8859/2020 in CS (COMM) No. Digitally
Signed  411/2020 Page 45 of 84 By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020
15:05:16 because there has been no challenge to the suit patents either by way
of pre or post-grant challenge or even by way of revocation or counter-claim,
up-until 2020, is the very reason why this Court should not countenance
arguments which seek to raise doubts qua the validity of the suit patents.
15.3 The plaintiffs argue that although given the scheme of the Act, there are
various stages at which validity of a patent can be challenged, it does not
follow that there is a presumption as to the invalidity of the patent. Mr.
Chandra, in this context, had cited the following judgements.
a) Order dated 15.03.2018, passed in CS (COMM) 737/2018, titled Pfizer Inc.
and Ors. vs. Nagesh Palepu and Ors.; and
b) Judgement dated 09.07.2015, passed in CS(OS) 442/2013, titled
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) vs. Mercury Electronics & Anr.
16\. Given the arguments and counter-arguments, it would be helpful if one
were to look to the scheme of the Act.
16.1 Section 25(1) accords leeway to oppose grant of a patent once an
application for the said purpose has been published. The grounds on which
opposition can be filed are set out in subclause (a) to (k) of Subsection (1)
of Section 25 of the Act.
16.2 Subsection (2) of Section 25 of the Act allows a person who is interested
in opposing the patent granted by the Controller by giving notice to him in
the prescribed manner on one or more grounds referred to in clause (a) to (k)
of the said subsection. However, the notice of opposition has to be given at
any time after the grant of the patent but before the expiry of the period of
one year from the grant of the patent. Pertinently, both under subsection (1)
and (2), the grounds of opposition are restricted to those referred to in the
respective sub- clauses.
16.3 Section 48 sets out the rights of the patentee subject to other
provisions Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020
& I.A. No. 8859/2020 in CS (COMM) No. Digitally Signed  411/2020 Page 46 of 84
By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 contained in the Act and
conditions specified in Section 47. The section, broadly, gives a right of
exclusivity to the patentee whereby he can exclude third parties from acts of
making ["act of using" in a process patent], using, offering for sale, selling
or importing for the purposes indicated herein before, that product ["that
process" in the case of process patent] in India as long as they do not have
the consent of the patentee.
16.4 Section 64 of the Act confers a right revocation of a patent. Thus, any
person interested [or the Central Government] can seek revocation of a patent
by either moving the appellate board constituted under the Act or by filing a
counter-claim in an infringement suit filed before the High Court. This apart,
Section 105 confers an independent right to file a declaratory suit for non-
infringement.
16.5 Pertinently, the grounds of revocation are set out in subclause (a) to
(q) of subsection (1) of Section 64 of the Act. Besides this, there are
special provisions for seeking revocation of patent or amendment of complete
specification conferred on the Central Government in matters relating to
atomic energy. 16.6 Likewise, Central Government can also seek revocation of a
patent in the public interest if it believes that the patent or the mode in
which it is exercised is mischievous to the State or generally prejudicial to
the public, albeit, after giving the patentee an opportunity of being heard in
the matter.
17\. Therefore, what is clear [and something which is conceded by both sides
as noticed above], a challenge can be laid either at the stage when an
application is moved for grant of a patent, albeit, after its publication or
after its grant, although, within the timeframe provided in the relevant
provision or even by seeking revocation by moving the appellate board or by
way of a counterclaim in the infringement suit.
18\. All this, points in the direction that the interested third parties can
lay challenge to an invention which is the subject matter of either the patent
application or the patent at various stages. The clearest indication of the

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 legislative intent is embedded in
subsection (4) of Section 13. Section 13 is a provision which empowers the
examiner before whom an application for grant of patent is placed to make
investigations to ascertain if a patent is anticipated by previous publication
and/or by a prior claim. 18.1 In this context, subsection (4) makes it clear
that examination and investigations required under Section 12 or Section 13
shall not be deemed, in any way, to warrant inter alia the validity of the
patent. In other words, even when the patent crosses the threshold of
examination by the patent office, it does not, as per the Statute, warrant its
validity. Therefore, quite clearly, irrespective of when the challenge is
laid, the challenger [i.e. the person interested] can put the patent in
jeopardy. [See: Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam vs. Hindustan Metal
Industries1, (1979) 2 SCC 511] 18.2 Thus, till the time the patent is
invalidated i.e. revoked, the patentee has the right to exclude third parties.
Therefore, the observations made in Pfizer Inc. and Ors. case and
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) case cannot, in my view, be read in a
manner whereby they roil against express provisions of the statute.
18.3 Furthermore, the argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs that since
the suit patents are old and thus, should be presumed to be valid cannot be
accepted for two reasons.
i. First, there is a period of overlap between the genus patent i.e. IN 147
and the species patent i.e. IN 625. The defendants, in this case, chose  1
This extract is taken from Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam vs. Hindustan Metal
Industries, (1979) 2 SCC 511 at page 521.
"32. It is noteworthy that the grant and sealing of the patent, or the
decision rendered by the Controller in the case of opposition, does not
guarantee the validity of the patent, which can be challenged before the High
Court on various grounds in revocation or infringement proceedings. It is
pertinent to note that this position viz. the validity of a patent is not
guaranteed by the grant, is now expressly provided in Section 13(4) of the
Patents Act. 1970. In the light of this principle, Mr Mehta's argument that
there is a presumption in favour of the validity of the patent, cannot be
accepted."

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 to wait [in line with arguments
advanced in their defence of the suit actions] till such time the validity
period of the genus patent i.e. IN 147 expired.
ii. Second, as indicated above, the scheme of the Act does not foreclose the
right of the defendants in defence to an infringement action to question the
validity of the patent. Section 107 of the Act, expressly confers a right on
the defendants to raise, in defence, in an infringement suit, all those
grounds on which the patent can be revoked under Section 64 of the very same
Act. Therefore, the judgement in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Ors vs. J.D.
Joshi and Ors., MANU/DE/1889/2015, if read in context, would demonstrate that
it has not emasculated the right of the defendant, as conferred under the Act,
to challenge the validity of the patent. The presumption of validity exists
only till such time the patent is challenged - a challenge which is credible
and no further. In my opinion, if the plaintiffs' argument was to be accepted,
then, it would have to be held that the older the patent, the stronger the
firewall. Such an interpretation, in my view, would be contrary to the plain
words of the Statute.
19\. The next question which arises for consideration is: at the stage of
preliminary injunction, what is the threshold that the challenger has to meet?
In other words, is the challenger required to demonstrate that the patent is
invalid or is the challenger required to establish that the patent is
vulnerable and that the validity is not vexatious.
19.1 This issue came up for consideration before a Division Bench of this
Court in F. Hoffmann-LA Roche Ltd. & Anr. vs. Cipla Ltd., 2009 (110) DRJ 452
(DB), wherein, the Court clearly set out the judicial standard which ought to
operate at the preliminary injunction stage. The Court, in no uncertain terms,

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 stated that validity of a patent is
required to be looked at the stage of trial. 19.2 However, at the stage of
preliminary injunction all that the defendant is required to demonstrate is
that she/he has made a credible challenge or that the patent is vulnerable and
that validity is not vexatious. The relevant observations made by the Division
Bench in this behalf are extracted hereafter.

55\. The question before this Court is when can it be said that the defendant
has raised a credible challenge to the validity of a patent held by the
plaintiff in an infringement action? During the course of the argument it was
suggested by counsel that the challenge had to be both strong and credible.
Also, the defendant resisting the grant of injunction by challenging the
validity of the patent is at this stage required to show that the patent is
"vulnerable" and that the challenge raises a "serious substantial question"
and a triable issue. Without indulging in an exercise in semantics, the Court

Page 50 of 84 By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 for grant of
injunction and a corresponding plea of the defendant challenging the validity
of the patent itself, must enquire whether the defendant has raised a credible
challenge. In other words, that would in the context of pharmaceutical
products, invite scrutiny of the order granting patent in the light of Section
3(d) and the grounds set out in Section 64 of the Patents Act 1970. At this
stage of course the Court is not expected to examine the challenge in any
great detail and arrive at a definite finding on the question of validity.
That will have to await the trial. At the present stage of considering the
grant of an interim injunction, the defendant has to show that the patent that
has been granted is vulnerable to challenge. Consequently, this Court rejects
the contentions of the plaintiffs on this issue and affirms the impugned
judgment of the learned Single Judge."
[Emphasis is mine] 19.3 This view has been reiterated in Natco Pharma vs. Bear
Healthcare LLC, 2019 80 PTC 131 [See: paragraphs 17 to 21]; and Natco Pharma
vs. Bristol Myers Squibb Holding, 263 (2019) DLT 622 [See: paragraphs 34 and
35].
19.4 The reliance by the plaintiffs on Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL)
case is, in my view, misplaced as that case concerned decision on the issue as
to which of the contesting parties should be burdened with proving a
particular issue. Interestingly, the Court, while distinguishing the judgement
rendered in TEN XC Wireless Inc. & Anr. vs. Mobi Antenna Technologies
(Shenzhen) Co. Ltd., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 4648 : (2012) 187 DLT 632 made the
following observations.
10\. Reliance on Bishwanath (supra) and Ten XC Wireless (supra) by the learned
counsel for the defendants is also misplaced. In fact, Bishwanath was premised
on Section 13(4) of the Patents Act, according to which there is no
presumption of validity of a patent only to the extent that no liability shall
be incurred by the Central Government or any other officer thereof in
connection with the grant of patent. In Ten XC Wireless, no presumption was
drawn in favour of the patent only for the purposes of an interim injunction
and not for onus of proof.
[Emphasis is mine] 19.5 Likewise, a perusal of the order in Pfizer Inc. and
Ors. case shows that the defendants in that case did not make any submission
as to how the challenge raised by them qua the patent-in-issue was credible.
It is in this context, that the Court granted the injunction. Pertinently,
this order was passed when the suit Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020

15:05:16 was listed for issuance of summons and notice in the interlocutory
application. The defendants, obviously, at that stage had no chance of showing
to the Court that there was a credible challenge to the patent-in-issue. The
Court left that window open by observing as follows.
"... Of course, this would not debar the defendants to raise a substantial,
tenable and credible challenge in its pleading."
19.6 This judgement is distinguishable as in the instant suit actions the
defendants have raised a credible challenge as discussed hereafter.
19.7 Similarly, J.D. Joshi case is distinguishable as the Court came to a
prima facie conclusion that the plaintiffs had a valid patent and the defences
raised did not enable it, at that juncture, to doubt the validity of the
patent. [See: paragraph 88 in J.D. Joshi] Such is not the position in the
present case.
ARE THE SUIT PATENTS VULNERABLE?
20\. The challenge to the species patent i.e. IN 625 is, broadly, laid on the
following five grounds.
i. First, since IN 147 expired on 02.10.2020 and according to the admissions
made by the plaintiffs in various paragraphs of the plaint that DAPA is
covered in the suit patents, in particular, in the genus patent i.e. IN 147,
it cannot be protected in terms of Section 53(4) of the Act.
ii. Second, IN 625 is vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1)(a) read
with Section 13(1)(b) of the Act on the ground of lack of novelty in view of
prior claiming by the genus patent i.e. IN 147.
iii. Third, IN 625 is vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1)(e) of the
Act on the ground of lack of novelty due to prior publication of WO'128 which
is the PCT equivalent of the genus patent i.e. IN 147.
iv. Fourth, IN 625 is vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1)(f) of the
Act as it lacks inventive step as provided in Section 2 (1) (ja) i.e. lacks

significance and is obvious to a person skilled in the art.
v. Lastly, IN 625 is vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1) of the Act
in view of the failure of the plaintiffs to make full and fair disclosure as
required under Section 8 of the Act.
21\. Insofar as the first aspect is concerned, let me quote the relevant
extracts from some of the paragraphs in the plaint.
CS (COMM) 410/2020 "16. The Plaintiffs' suit patents IN 205147 [genus patent]
and IN 23 5 625 [ species patent] cover the Plaintiffs' drugs comprising inter
alia its invention DAPAGLIFLOZIN, which are made available by the Plaintiff
under the brands FORXIGA, XIGDUO, XIGDUO XR, XIGDUO IR, QTERN.
xxx xxx xxx V. THE PLAINTIFFS' SUIT PATENTS
22\. DAPAGLIFLOZIN falls within the scope of the Plaintiffs Indian Patent
Numbers IN 205147; IN 235625. ...
36\. DAPAGLIFLOZIN is covered by the Markush claim in patent IN '147. However,
it is specifically disclosed only in patent IN 235625 (IN '625) and falls
within the scope of claim 1 thereof which specifically claims said compound as
well as pha11naceutically acceptable salts, stereoisomers, or prodrug esters
thereof. Further, claim 2 of the suit paten t IN '625 claims pharmaceutical 32
compositions prepared using DAP AGLIFLOZIN. The Plaintiffs have filed a copy
of the complete specification and granted claims of IN '625 in the present
proceedings and are not extracting the above claims for the sake of brevity."
[Emphasis is mine] 21.1 There are several other paragraphs, for instance,
paragraphs nos. 56 and 86 of the plaint filed in CS (COMM) 410/2020, wherein,
a similar averment has been made by the plaintiffs.
21.2 The fact that IN 147 has been worked commercially in India cannot be
disputed if one were to peruse Form 27 filed by the plaintiffs in consonance
with the provisions of Section 146(2) read with Rule 131 of The Patent Rules,
2003 [in short "Rules"].

not in dispute that both applications concerned the drug Farxiga which is the

21.6 Therefore, the fact that both in the pleadings and in the aforementioned
documents, there is a definitive assertion that DAPA is covered in both the
genus patents granted in USA and India i.e. US 126 and IN 147 cannot be
disputed. The plaintiffs, however, submit [and an averment to that effect has
been made in paragraph 28 of the plaint], that while DAPA is covered in IN
147, it is not disclosed. The plaintiffs rely upon the Markush structure in
support of their plea.
21.7 Markush structure or Markush claim/group is a methodology employed

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 by a patent drafter to select a
particular element of the invention wherein all elements share a common
characteristic. Thus, a patent drafter who does not use a Markush claim/group
would be required to write a series of alternate dependent claims claiming use
of each of the elements selected from the group. In a nutshell, Markush claim
allows a patent drafter to condense a multitude of alternate dependent claims
into one single claim2. 21.8 The argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs
that coverage does not necessarily include disclosure is founded on the
Markush claim/group. It is also contended by the plaintiffs that the judgement
of the Supreme Court did not close this gap between what is covered and that
which is disclosed. The emphasis, in this behalf, was laid on paragraph 134 of
the Novartis case. This argument though was apart from the other features of
the Novartis case which were sought to be highlighted to establish that case
was distinguishable on facts from those obtaining in the instant suit actions.
21.9 Mr. Vaidyanathan, on the other hand, relied upon portions of the Novartis
case to demonstrate that in the very least what is claimed is certainly
disclosed; although according to him, the observations in paragraph 118 and
119 of the Novartis case obliterate the distinction between coverage and
disclosure. In support of this plea, Mr. Vaidyanathan pointed out the
submissions advanced by the counsel for Novartis before the Supreme Court to
the effect that imatinib mesylate which was covered in the Zimmerman patent
was not disclosed - a submission which was ultimately rejected by the Supreme
Court.
22\. In my view, the fact that the plaintiffs have taken out an infringement
action both for IN 147 and IN 625 is a sufficient clue, at least at this
juncture, that DAPA is claimed in both suit patents. It seems incongruous to
me that a patent holder can take out an infringement action for a patent and
yet aver it is  2 See: Eric, Markush Claims, what are they, when should I use

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 not disclosed.
22.1 This is especially so as under our Act the "complete specification"
provision encapsulated in various subclauses of subsection (4) of Section 10
require setting out by an applicant who seeks grant of patent to fully and
particularly describe the invention and its operation or use and the method by
which it is performed, disclose the method of performing the invention which
is known to her/him and for which she/he is entitled to claim protection and
end with a claim or claims defining the scope of the invention. [See: Section
10(4)(a) to (c)] The applicant is also required to provide an abstract of
technical information qua the subject invention. The claim or claims forming
part of complete specification inter alia are required to be "fairly based on
the matter disclosed in the specification" [See: Section 10(5) of the Act].
22.2 Therefore, in my view, the defendants' submission that IN 625 should be
revoked on account of prior claiming under the provisions of Section 64(1)(a)
of the Act has substance, at least at this stage.
22.3 What lends credence to this plea are the provisions of Section 13 (1) (b)
of the Act which require the examiner to ascertain as to whether the
application referred to him for investigation under Section 12 adverts to an
invention which is anticipated by a prior claim. Section 13 (1) (b), simply
put, allows an examiner to make use of an Indian patent application or an
Indian patent which, though published, after the impugned patent bears a
priority date which is earlier than the impugned patent. The fact that the
said patent was published after the impugned patent does not come in the way
of the investigation carried out by the examiner.
22.4 In the present case, the Indian genus patent i.e. IN 147 bears the
priority dates 12.10.1999 and 05.04.2000 whereas the Indian species patent
i.e. IN 625 bears 20.05.2002 as its priority date. For the purposes of Section
64(1)(a) this ingredient is sufficient. Therefore, as long as the defendant
can establish that the inventions so far claimed in any claim of the complete
specification [in this case Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS

625] was claimed in a valid claim of an earlier priority date contained in the
complete specification of another patent [i.e. IN 147] - a ground for
revocation is made out.
22.5 I must indicate that the plaintiffs, in support of their submission, have
cited the judgement rendered by the English Court of Appeal in Daikin Kogyo
Co. Ltd. (Shingu and Another's) Application, (1974) R.P.C. 18. This was a case
where grant of process patent was opposed on the grounds of prior claim and
insufficiency of description. The specification related to a process for
making tetrafluoroethylene [TFE] by pyrolysis of chlorodifluoromethane [CDM]
with water vapour. Furthermore, it was specifically asserted that the
invention insofar as claimed in Claim 2 of the application in suit is claimed
in Claim 21 of the opponent's patent.
22.6 The Court ultimately concluded that the process claimed differed in terms
of steps and features. One specific feature that the Court noticed was that
surface to volume ratio had to be less than 130 reciprocal metres, a feature
which was not contained in example 2 of the cited patent. The Court noted that
the reaction zone was such that the surface to volume ratio was over 130.
Importantly, the Court based its decision on an earlier judgement rendered in
Kromshroder's Patent [1960] R.P.C. 75. The Court of Appeal also noted the
judgement rendered in Merck & Co. (Macek's) Patent, [1967] R.P.C. 157 which
was a case of revocation based on prior claiming. Pertinently, the Court of
Appeal did not, in any manner, dilute the ratio of the Merck & Co. (Macek's)
case. The facts in Merck & Co. (Macek's) case reveal that 4 claims of the
letters patent in the suit read as follows.
> "The four claims of the letters patent in suit read as follows :

liquid.
4\. A composition as claimed in claim 1 in which the antibiotics are
incorpora- ted in an ointment vehicle."
22.7 Noticing the aforementioned claims, the Court observed that Claim 1 is
comprehensive which permits alternative additions to novobiocin which
alternative additions consist of one or more of the named antibiotics.
According to the Court, it was a convenient submission of what, in effect,
were number of separate claims to different compositions of which some would
relate to compositions having two ingredients and some to three or more
ingredients. 22.8 The Court went on to re-write the claim to make plain this
differentiation. The patentees contended [an aspect which was noticed by the
Court] that such notional dismemberment of their claim necessarily involved
destruction of the generality of the inventive step and, thus, deprived them
of the real differentiation between what they sought to protect and that which
was cited as prior document. The Court, in this background, made the following
pertinent observations.

23\. The plaintiffs also cited the decision of U.S. Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals [CCPA] rendered in Application of Virgil W. Vogel and Paul W.
Vogel, 422 F.2d 438 (C.C.P.A. 1970) in support of their stand. 23.1 This
appeal arose from a decision of the Patent Office Board of Appeals whereby
rejection of claims 7, 10 and 11 in the appellant's patent application for
"Process of Preparing Packaged Meat Products for Prolonged Storage" was
affirmed. In this case, the sole ground of rejection of claims 7, 10 and 11
was that they were unpatentable over appellant's co-pending patented claims in
Vogel et al in view of Ellies.
23.2 It was typically a double patenting type of rejection. The CCPA viewed
the matter from two angels. First, was it the same invention i.e. identical
subject matter? Second, whether the claim in the application, defined merely
an obvious variation of an invention disclosed and claimed in the patent.
Insofar as the first aspect was concerned, the CCPA observed as follows.
> "The first question is: Is the same invention being claimed twice? The
> answer is no. The patent claims are limited to pork. Appealed claims 7 and
> 10 are limited to meat, which is not the same thing. Claims 7 and 10 could

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 23.3 As regards the other aspect
which is whether the appeal claim defined merely an obvious variation of the
invention disclosed, the CCPA noted that the appeal Claim 11 recited beef
which did not read on the pork process disclosed and claimed in the patent.
The CCPA, thus, concluded that Claim 11 did not define merely an obvious
variation of the pork process. It found that the specific time and temperature
consideration concerning pork might not apply to beef. Accordingly, it held
that Claim 11 did not present any kind of double patenting situation. However,
in the case of Claim 10, it made the following pertinent observations.

24\. Furthermore, qua the arguments advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs that
DAPA, though, covered in IN 147, was not disclosed therein, is answered, to my
mind, by the judgement of the United Kingdom Supreme Court [UK SC] in
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (Respondent). vs. Kymab Ltd. (Appellant), (2020)
UKSC 27 [Majority view 4:1].
24.1 This was a case where a dispute related to two patents obtained by
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. [RPI] with a priority date of 16.02.2001 and
each with substantially the same disclosure to justify different claims. The
two patents were briefly referred to as "287 patent" and "163 patent". The 163
patent was divisional of 287 patent.
24.2 The challenge to the validity arose because RPI alleged infringement by

and Claim 5 and 6 of 283 patent by offering to the pharmaceutical industry its
own transgenic mouse i.e. "Kymouse" with reverse chimeric locus some of which
included the whole of the human variable segments in both the heavy and the
light chain loci. The UK SC was faced with a challenge to the aforementioned
patents which sought to confer monopoly over the creation of a range of
transgenic mouse. 24.3 The Court observed that "in order to patent an
inventive product the patentee must be able to demonstrate (if challenged)
that a skilled person can make the product by the use of teachings disclosed
in the patent coupled with common general knowledge which is already available
at the time of priority date without having to undertake undue experimental
burden or apply any inventiveness on their own". This requirement, according
to the UK SC, is labelled as sufficiency. Applying this test, the Court culled
out certain principles which are set out in paragraph 56 of the judgement. A
couple of principles that the Court adverted to reads as follows.
> "iii) Patentees are free to choose how widely to frame the range of products
> for which they claim protection. But they need to ensure that they make no
> broader claim than is enabled by their disclosure.
> iv) The disclosure required of the patentee is such as will, coupled with

> to enable the skilled person to make substantially all the types or

> skilled person using the disclosure in the patent will, subject to de
> minimis or wholly irrelevant exceptions, be bound to exceed the contribution
> to the art made by the patent, measured as it must be at the priority date.
> vi) This does not mean that the patentee has to demonstrate in the

25\. Applying these principles, it would have to be said that the arguments of
the plaintiffs that DAPA was not claimed in IN 147 seem to be untenable at

Pharmaceuticals decision, in my opinion, has a greater persuasive value than
the decisions rendered in Eli Lily, Apotex, 2010 FCA 214 and Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories (UK) Ltd vs. Eli Lilly and Co Ltd. (2009) EWCA 1362 cited on
behalf of the plaintiffs, which are, distinguishable on facts. 25.1 It must be
stated that it was portrayed on behalf of the plaintiffs that the genus patent
i.e. IN 147 ringfenced certain compounds which were disclosed only when the
species patent i.e. IN 625 was granted, which would, essentially, mean that
the written description/complete specification of IN 147 covered DAPA but did
not disclose it. To my mind, such written descriptions/specifications would be
flawed as it would prevent third parties from carrying out research in future.
The Federal Court, in an en banc decision in Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vs.
Eli Lilly and Company, 598 F.3d 1336, made some pertinent observations in this
behalf.
> "The written description requirement also ensures that when a patent claims

Ariad complains that the doctrine disadvantages universities to the extent
that basic research cannot be patented. But the patent law has always been
directed to the "useful Arts," U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8, meaning
inventions with a practical use, see Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 532-36,
86 S.Ct. 1033, 16 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966). Much university research relates to basic
research, including research into scientific principles and mechanisms of
action, see, e.g., Rochester, 358 F.3d 916, and universities may not have the
resources or inclination to work out the practical implications of all such
research, i.e., finding and identifying compounds able to affect the mechanism
discovered. That is no failure of the law's interpretation, but its Signature

Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 intention. Patents are not awarded for
academic theories, no matter how groundbreaking or necessary to the later
patentable inventions of others. "[A] patent is not a hunting license. It is
not a reward for the search, but compensation for its successful conclusion."
Id. at 930 n. 10 (quoting Brenner, 383 U.S. at 536, 86 S.Ct. 1033). Requiring
a written description of the invention limits patent protection to those who
actually perform the difficult work of "invention"--that is, conceive of the
complete and final invention with all its claimed limitations--and disclose
the fruits of that effort to the public.
That research hypotheses do not qualify for patent protection possibly results
in some loss of incentive, although Ariad presents no evidence of any
discernable impact on the pace of innovation or the number of patents obtained
by universities. But claims to research plans also impose costs on downstream
research, discouraging later invention. The goal is to get the right balance,
and the written description doctrine does so by giving the incentive to actual
invention and not "attempt[s] to preempt the future before it has arrived."
Fiers, 984 F.2d at 1171. As this court has repeatedly stated, the purpose of
the written description requirement is to "ensure that the scope of the right
to exclude, as set forth in the claims, does not overreach the scope of the
inventor's *1354 contribution to the field of art as described in the patent
specification." Rochester, 358 F.3d at 920 (quoting Reiffin v. Microsoft
Corp., 214 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2000)). It is part of the quid pro quo of
the patent grant and ensures that the public receives a meaningful disclosure
in exchange for being excluded from practicing an invention for a period of
time. Enzo, 323 F.3d at 970."
26\. In my opinion, given the aforesaid discussion, a credible defence to the
infringement action is set up by the defendants.
27\. This takes me to the other aspect i.e. challenge laid to IN 625 on the
ground that it was anticipated by what was published or publicly known from IN
147. Concededly, the PCT publication date of IN 147 is 19.04.2001 which is
well before, as noted above, the priority date of IN 625, that is, 20.05.2002.
It is contended on behalf of the defendants that since DAPA is both claimed
and "fully and particularly described" as required under Section 10(4)(a) of
the Act as a part of its complete specification, there is a credible case that
DAPA was known and, therefore, vulnerable under Section 64(1)(e). 27.1 In this
behalf, reference was made to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Monsanto
Company vs. Coromandel Indag Products, (1986) 1 SCC 642. It was contended on
behalf of the defendants that the expression publicly known is to be
understood from the point of view of a person engaged in the pursuit of
knowledge of the patented product which in this case would be a man of science
dealing with organic/medicinal chemistry.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 27.2 Thus, based on the comparison
of written descriptions of WO'128 and IN 625, it was contended that to the man
of science of ordinary skill but otherwise interested in the field of
organic/medicinal chemistry having reasonable experience, DAPA was not new and
was known prior to the priority date of IN
625\. 27.3 In support of this contention, the counsel of the defendants laid
stress on the fact that the person skilled in the art, ultimately, would
filter down to a small class of compounds since the prior publication set out
a series of preferred claims. Thus, according to the defendants, even if the
prior art referred to infinite number of molecules, a person skilled in the
art would be able to narrow it down to 8 molecules. In support of this
submission, the defendants have, to a large extent, relied upon the affidavit
of their expert witness i.e. one, Dr. Stephen F. Martin.
27.4 The plaintiffs, on the other hand, have relied upon an affidavit of one,
Dr. Easwaran dated 18.10.2020 to contend that WO'128 which is the PCT
equivalent of the suit patent IN 147 would have structures which would cover
millions of compounds and, therefore, going by the Markush formula they would
have to be taken down and made one by one. This would take a lifetime. It was
also contended that substitutions indicated by Dr. Martin, such as, A, CH- 2,
R1 had no obvious logic and, therefore, could only be carried out by hindsight
wisdom.
28\. Having heard arguments of both sides on this aspect of the matter, in my
view, while counsel for the defendants, based on the affidavit of Mr. Martin,
did try to convey that a person skilled in the art could iterate the claims
and arrive at 8 molecules based on prior publication and not hindsight, this
is an aspect which would be required to be tested in a trial. Therefore, on
this score, the defendants' defence, at this stage, in my opinion, does not
inject vulnerability.
29\. This brings me to the ground for revocation taken under Section 64(1)(f)
i.e. that IN 625 is vulnerable as it does not involve any "inventive step". It

By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 required to be noticed
that the expression "inventive step" has been defined under Section 2(1)(ja)
as follows.
> "(ja) "inventive step" means a feature of an invention that involves
> technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic
> significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person
> skilled in the art;"
29.1 A plain reading of the definition would show that it has two parts to it
and both are inextricably linked with the other. In other words, if a patentee
is unable to measure up to the ingredients of either of the two parts, the
invention claimed is not construed under the Act as an inventive step. 29.2
First part involves patentee to show that the invention claimed in any claim
involves "technical advance" as compared to the existing knowledge or has
"economic significance" or both. The second part of the definition alludes to
the fact that the invention should not be obvious to the person skilled in the
art. 29.3 A comparison of the complete specifications/descriptions of Indian
genus patent i.e. IN 147 and Indian species patent i.e. IN 625 shows that
there is no technical advance of the latter over the former. This is clearly
evident if one were to peruse the following extracts from Indian genus patent
i.e. IN 147 and Indian species patent i.e. IN 625.
Extracts from Indian Patent 147 [internal page Extracts from Indian Patent 625

29.4 The plaintiffs sought to get over this by seeking to rely upon Dr.

technical advance. The data pertaining to technical advance is set out in Dr.

following broad headings.

> rats (short-term animal model) C. Enhanced ability to reduce plasma glucose
> over a 15-day period after oral administration to ZDF rats (longer-term

29.5 Based on the data set out in the affidavit, Dr. Washburn made the
following conclusions.
> "29. In my opinion, the increased selectivity and the reduction of glucose
> levels obtained with dapagliflozin compared to Example 12 of WO '128 in the

30\. In my opinion, if this information was not available at the time the
application for grant of patent was filed, then, this cannot be taken into
account, at this juncture, by the plaintiffs in support of their plea that IN
625 involved an inventive step. There is no clue in IN 625 of an unknown
technical effect on its priority date. Dr. Washburn's affidavit, who professes
to be the co-inventor of DAPA, could have come to the rescue of the plaintiffs
to demonstrate technical advance if, at least a seed of that nature had been
planted in IN 625, on its priority date.
30.1 The plaintiffs' argument that post filing data relating to the invention
is admissible is based on two grounds.
i. First and foremost, the applicant may not be fully aware of the advances
and properties of the subject invention, in this case, the compound DAPA, on
the priority date. In this behalf, it is stated that DAPA's properties for
treatment of heart failure came to be known only subsequently.
ii. Second, there is no requirement in law that all properties, advantages,
and characteristics should be stated on the filing date of the patent
application.

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 In support of their plea, the
plaintiffs relied upon Genetics institute, LLC, vs. Novartis vaccines, 655
F.3d 1291 (2011); and Knoll Pharm. Co. vs. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 367 F.3d
1381, 1385. It was argued that the plaintiffs had complied with the best code
rule as engrafted in Section 10(4) of the Act which is qualified by the
expression "known to the applicant". It was also contended that they had
satisfied the examiner on the aspect of inventive step and factually the
examiner had raised no such objection in his examination report of October
2007. The plaintiffs also sought to contend that they met the plausible
unknown technical effect test as formulated in Generics (UK) Limited vs. Yeda
Research and Development Company Limited, (2017) EWHC 2629 (Pat).
30.2 In this context, I may refer to the judgement in Generics (UK) Limited
vs. Yeda Research and Development Company Limited, (2017) EWHC 2629 (Pat)
cited on behalf of the defendants. In this case, Generics, which was the
claimant, sought revocation of a European patent [entitled low-frequency
glatiramer acetate therapy] of which the defendant i.e. Yeda was the
registered proprietor and a third party [i.e. Teva] was the exclusive
licensee. One of the issues which arose for consideration before the Court
concerned the lack of inventive step for want of technical contribution and
insufficiency. 30.3 On behalf of Generics, it was contended that the claimed
inventions made no technical contribution to the art and, therefore, did not
involve inventive steps as summarized in another judgement i.e. Generics (UK)
Ltd vs Yeda Research and Development Co Ltd, [2013] EWCA Civ 925
Alternatively, it was argued that the technical contribution was insufficient
as per principles summarised by Kitchin LJ in Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc vs.
Gilead Sciences Inc, [2016] EWCA Civ 1089. The Court after discussing the
issue made the following crucial observations.
197\. In case this case goes further, I must briefly address the Defendants'
reliance upon evidence which post-dates the priority date of the Patent. It is

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 common ground that such evidence
can only be relied upon to confirm the existence of a technical effect which
is plausible in the light of the specification and the skilled person's common
general knowledge, and not to establish the existence of a technical effect
for the first time.
[Emphasis is mine] 30.4 Therefore, what emerges is this: that post priority
date evidence which has been furnished in Dr. Washburn's affidavit to show
technical advance can only be taken into account to confirm the existence of
technical effect which is found embedded in the specification of IN 625 and is
capable of being understood by a skilled person having common general
knowledge and not to rely upon the same to establish its effect for the first
time. 30.5 The plaintiffs have not been able to demonstrate, at least at this
stage, the existence of such technical effect in the specifications. The
plaintiffs' argument that the examiner should have been conscious of the
inventive step objection or that evidence of technical advance could be placed
before the Court even at this juncture fails to take into account the plain
language of Section 64(1)(f) read with Section 2 (1)(ja) of the Act. The
defendants are entitled, as noted above, to submit, in support of their
challenge, that there is no demonstrable technical advance as on the date of
priority of IN 625.
30.6 Whether or not the examiner raised this issue, the defendants are
certainly entitled to raise the same in defence to an infringement action. The
plaintiffs' submissions, to my mind, would only buttress the stand of the
defendants that there is a credible challenge to IN 625. The reference by the
plaintiffs to some of the attributes which, according to them, are referred to
in IN 625 does not demonstrate, at least at this stage, technical advance.
31\. On the last aspect, which is, as to whether the plaintiffs failed to make
a complete disclosure in terms of Section 8 of the Act, the following facts
need to be noticed.
i. The plaintiffs had, vide a letter dated 10.01.2005, filed the corresponding
US patent with the Indian Patent Office. The Indian Signature Not I.A.Verified

Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 Patent Office, while issuing its first examination
report on 12.10.2007, against serial no. 13 concededly sought the following
information.
ii. In response thereto, the plaintiffs on 08.10.2007, stated the following.
"Regarding paragraph 13 of the official letter, we have the honour to submit
herewith copies of the EPO decision to grant and the EP granted patent, which
in turn meets with the requirement of Section 8(2)"
iii. Clearly the plaintiffs did not provide to the Indian Patent Office, the
office action/examination report dated 30.07.2002 issued by the USPTO in
connection with US 117 which corresponds to IN 625. In the examination report
of 30.07.2002, the USPTO inter alia stated the following.
"1. Claims 1-17 are rejected under the judicially created doctrine of double
patenting over claims 14-30 of U. S. Patent No. 6,414,126 since the claims, if
allowed, would improperly extend the "right to exclude" already granted in the
patent. The subject matter claimed in the instant application is fully
disclosed in the patent and is covered by the patent since the patent and the
application are claiming common subject matter, as follows:
Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably
distinct from each other because the present claims are directed towards
glucoside structures characterized by specific stereochemistry and further
these compounds are characterized by biaryl substitution (SGLT2 inhibitor
compounds), their pharmaceutical acceptable salts and a method of treatment of
diabetes employing an SGLT2 Inhibition (i.e. C-Aryl glucoside compounds) which
encompass the invention cited in claims in 14-30 of '126 which are directed
toward the (SGLT2 inhibitor compounds), their pharmaceutical composition and a
method of treatment of diabetes with an SGLT2 inhibitor.
The issued patent '126 differ from the present application in that it does not
include the acetyl derivatives of glucoside structures characterized by
specific stereochemistry in a C-Aryl glucoside compounds (22 claim 17).
Furthermore, there is no apparent reason why applicant was prevented from
presenting claims corresponding to those of the instant application during
prosecution of the application which matured into a patent. See In re
Schneller, 397 F.2d 350, 158 USPQ 210 (CC)A 1968). See also MPEP 804."
iv. It is in response to the same that the plaintiffs, on 19.08.2002
voluntarily sought to limit the term of US 117 [equivalent to IN 625] to the
date when the US genus patent 126 was to expire. It was only after terminal
disclaimer was filed by the plaintiffs, which was accepted by USPTO, that US
117 was granted on 20.09.2002, albeit, Signature Not I.A.Verified No.

Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 with the caveat that it would expire on the same date
as the US genus patent i.e. US 126. This information was not furnished to the
Indian Patent Office.
31.1 In this behalf, the plaintiffs contend that the Indian Patent Office was
aware of the fact that the continuation- in- part application had been moved
before the USPTO which, according to the plaintiffs, would have indicated to
the Indian Patent Office that the corresponding US patent was to terminate on
the same date.
31.2 Second, the fact that USPTO had already granted patents, it was not
incumbent upon the plaintiffs to file the examination reports generated by the
USPTO. It was also contended that the error, if any, was bona fide and,
therefore, could not lead to revocation under Section 64(1)(m) of the Act. In
support of their plea, the plaintiffs placed reliance on judgement dated
07.11.2014, passed in FAO (OS) No. 16/2014, titled Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl &
Anr. vs. Koninklijke Phillips Electronics.
32\. In my view, the judgement in Chemtura Corporation vs. Union of India
(UOI) and Ors., 2009 (41) PTC 260 (Del) sets the tone as to what all needs to
be provided to the patent office when a prospective patentee seeks grant of
patent.
32.1 In the instant actions, specific details were sought by the Indian Patent
Office concerning search and examination report. What was submitted by the
plaintiffs to the Indian Patent Office via the letter dated 10.01.2005 were
the corresponding US patents and not the examination reports. It is not denied
by the plaintiffs that the examination report dated 30.07.2002 issued by the
USPTO qua US species patent 117 was not furnished.
32.2 It is also not denied by the plaintiffs that their response of
19.08.2002, whereby, the validity period of US 117 was voluntarily aligned
with the US genus patent i.e. US 126 was not placed before the Indian Patent
Office. These Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No.

documents which ought to have been furnished to the Indian Patent Office.
32.3 The submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs that the terminal
disclaimer is an obviation and not an admission of obviousness is not an
answer to the provisions of Section 8(2) of the Act which is mandatory.
Assuming, under the USA patent law, it is construed as an obviation, even
then, in my view, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to furnish the
examination report of the USPTO. As to what would have followed from there,
would obviously be within the ken of the examiner at the Indian Patent Office.
The scope of Section 8 of the Act has been captured in Chemtura Corporation
case. The relevant observations are replicated hereafter for the sake of
convenience.

49\. This Court holds that for the aforementioned reasons, in view of the
prima facie non-compliance by the Plaintiff with the requirement of Sections 8
(1)(b) and 8(2) of the Act, the ground for revocation as contained in Section
64 (1) (m) is prima Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No.

..."
[Emphasis is mine] 32.4 The reliance placed on behalf of the plaintiffs on a
judgement of the Division Bench i.e. in Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl case, in my
view, misses a vital distinction between this case and the judgement rendered
in Chemtura Corporation case. In this context, it is required to be noticed
that the judgement in Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl case was rendered in the
context of Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 [in short
"CPC"] whereas the judgement in Chemtura Corporation case was foregrounded in
the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the CPC [See paragraph 39 in
Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl case].
32.5 Furthermore, in Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl case, the Court ruled that
because the power to revoke patent was discretionary [on account of the
expression 'may' inserted in subsection (1) of section 64 of the Act], a
decision in the matter could be reached only after a trial in view of absence
of an unequivocal and/or unambiguous admission by the plaintiff in that case.
32.6 A careful perusal of the facts found in Maj. (Retd.) Sukesh Behl case
would show that the plaintiffs' attorney while furnishing information
concerning foreign applications had missed out some part of the information.
However, the plaintiffs' attorney on their own, albeit after a lapse of time,
had filed a letter with the Indian Patent Office whereby the information which
was missed out was furnished. In the letter, it was indicated that the
documents received by the attorney had some part of the information
incorporated on the reverse side of the said documents. It was stated that the
paralegal who was assisting the attorney had inadvertently left out the said
information. 32.7 Construing these facts, the Court ruled that it was not a
case of a clear and unambiguous admission, thus, triggering the provisions of
Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC. Pertinently, the Court agreed with the judgement
rendered in Chemtura Corporation case that the provisions of Section 8 were
mandatory. Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020

By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 32.8 As indicated above,
the plaintiffs in support of their submission that filing of terminal
disclaimer was only an obviation and not admission of obviousness and double
patenting had relied upon the judgement of the US Federal Court in Quad
Environment vs. Union Sanitary, 946 F2d 870. The defendants, on the other
hand, relied upon the judgement of the US Supreme Court in Festo Corp. vs.
Shoketsu Kinzoku3, 535 U.S 722 (2002); and another judgement of the US Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit SimpleAir, Inc. vs. Google LLC, Appeal
Number: 16-2738, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
32.9 A perusal of these judgements would show that while terminal disclaimers
are not treated as admissions, they are taken into account to ascertain the
prosecution history of the patent i.e. the reason as to why the patentee chose
to narrow down its claim. Thus, while terminal disclaimer filed by a patentee
is not treated as a complete bar against the defence of non- obviousness,
depending on facts, it can operate as estopped by conduct.
33\. The point to be stressed here is that under our Act, was the examiner
under the Indian Patent Office not entitled to know as to what was the
prosecution history of the plaintiffs qua the corresponding patents in US. In
my opinion, the answer to this has to be in the affirmative. Chemtura
Corporation case, while interpreting the provisions of Section 8 of our Act,
in a sense, in its own language, brings to fore this seminal point. 33.1
Therefore, to my mind, as to whether or not the Court would, ultimately,
revoke the suit patents for failure to furnish information, as sought for by
the  3 "... When the patentee is unable to explain the reason for amendment,
estoppel not only applies but also "bar[s] the application of the doctrine of
equivalents as to that element." Ibid. These words do not mandate a complete
bar; they are limited to the circumstance where "no explanation is
established." They do provide, however, that when the court is unable to
determine the purpose underlying a narrowing amendment--and hence a rationale
for limiting the estoppel to the surrender of particular equivalents--the
court should presume that the patentee surrendered all subject matter between
the broader and the narrower language."

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 Indian Patent Office, would be
ruled upon after the trial. It, nevertheless, is an important factor to be
taken into account at a preliminary injunction stage; at which point, the
Court exercises equitable jurisdiction.
34\. This brings me to the arguments raised concerning the balance of
convenience, and irreparable harm. In my view, if, as held by me above, the
defendants have been able to set up a credible challenge and/or establish, at
least at the preliminary injunction stage, the vulnerability of the suit
patents, even if the balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiffs,
the injunction cannot be granted.
34.1 On the other hand, if the plaintiffs had established a strong prima facie
case for grant of a preliminary injunction, they would still have to satisfy
the Court as to whether or not balance of convenience was in their favour and
that denial of interim relief would cause irreparable damage. In this
background, let me examine the rival contentions made on behalf of the parties
before me. 34.2 The plaintiffs claim that the Indian genus patent i.e. IN 147
survived its full validity period and the Indian species patent i.e. IN 625 is
in 18 th year of its lifecycle. The plaintiffs' product is being sold in India
since 2015 at reasonable prices. The defendants, according to the plaintiffs,
should be asked to "clear the way" as contemplated in Merck Sharp and Dohme
Corporation and Ors. vs. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, MANU/DE/0852/2015 by
following any of the following rules i.e. i. Seeking voluntary license;
                 ii.     Seeking compulsory license;
                iii.     Filing revocations;
                iv.      Filing pre-grant opposition and post-grant opposition; and
                 v.      Filing a declaratory action for non-infringement.
34.3 The suit patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625 were published in 2005 and were

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 granted nearly 13 and 11 years ago
respectively. Besides this, the plaintiffs have obtained injunctions in
several pending suit actions which have been instituted in this Court.
Furthermore, if the injunction is not granted, it would destroy the
plaintiffs' market qua their product. Besides this, doctors have expressed
concerns about the quality of the products that the defendants may launch. It
is also contended that the damages are difficult to compute. Monetary
compensation, according to the plaintiffs, will not be adequate. It is
emphasized that the plaintiffs are interested in a real and not a pyrrhic
victory by having their rights enforced under the Act.
34.4 The defendants, on the other hand, say that the plaintiffs' suit actions
are abusive which are intended to re-monopolise their rights that admittedly
came to an end on 02.10.2020. It is emphasized by the defendants that grant of
an injunction would not only impact the defendants' rights to enter the market
but would deprive the public at large to obtain their drug at relatively cheap
prices. It is contended that since the plaintiffs are interested in licensing
their product to third parties, the damage if any caused is compensable in
monetary terms in accordance with the mandate of the law.
34.5 As against this, if an injunction is granted, the opportunity lost by the
defendants to market their products cannot be quantified in monetary terms.
Therefore, even from the point of restitution, the balance tilts in favour of
the defendants.
35\. Having considered the case from the point of view of facets involving
balance of convenience and irreparable harm, it has to be stated that the fact
that a challenge has been laid at the stage when the plaintiffs seek to
enforce their rights under the patents would not propel the Court [as
indicated above] to grant an injunction if the challenge is credible.
35.1 The provisions of the Act do not provide any shield of inviolability.
This principle is true not only in India but jurisdictions across the world.
In no country, a mere grant of a patent by the patent offices' guarantees
their validity. Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No.

to remember that grant of monopoly to the inventor, which is necessary for
her/him to recoup investments and/or derive profits from her/his inventions,
comes with a quid pro quo as noticed in paragraph 38 of Report on the Revision
of the Patents Law by Shri Justice N. Rajagopala Ayyangar (September, 1959).
Paragraph 38 reads thus:
> "38. I have already set out the considerations which are said to constitute
> the quid pro quo for the grant of the patent monopoly, namely; (1) the
> working of the invention within the country so as to result in the
> establishment in the country of a new industry or an improvement of an
> existing industry which would profitably employ the labour and capital of
> the country and thus increase the national wealth, and (2) disclosure to the
> public of the invention and the manner of its working so that on the expiry
> of the life of the patent the public are enabled to work the invention
> themselves and in competition with each other. Where the patentee has no
> intention of working the invention in this country either because he
> considers that this is not profitable or because he prefers to expand the
> production in his home country so as to achieve there greater efficiency and
> more production or is otherwise not interested in working the invention in
> India, the grant of the Indian patent might tend to improve the economy of
> the patentee's home country but offers little advantage to us. Unless
> therefore the law provides for measures to be taken to compel the patentees
> to work the invention within the country, and these measures are effective
> to achieve their purpose, the social cost involved in the grant of the
> patent is not offset by any benefit to the community. As regards the
> possible advantage which might result by disclosure it should be noted that
> most of the inventions patented by foreigners in this country are also
> patented abroad and the theory therefore that but for patent protection the

KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 35.3 India, it appears, brought in
certain amendments to balance the interests of the inventors as also those of
her citizens. The insertions inter alia of Sections 2(1)(j), 2(1)(ja), and
2(1)(l); Section 3(d); Section 8; Section 10(5); Section 53; and Section
107(A) were a step in that direction. The trade-off, it appears, was between
uniformly increasing the validity of patents including those which were
granted for drugs for 20 years as against the right of the local industries to
be able to work the patent to provide the fruits of the invention to its
citizenry at reasonable prices and to embed skills locally. 35.4 This is
acutely true when seen in the context of enforcement of patents concerning
drugs. The Court has to be vigilant towards attempts of the patentee that aims
at evergreening an invention which does not inter alia involve an inventive
step i.e. technical advance or economic significance. Therefore, depriving the
defendants, at this stage, from manufacturing and selling their drugs, when,
during the validity period of the genus patent i.e. IN 147 they largely held
themselves in check would, in my opinion, not be appropriate, especially, when
they have set up a credible challenge to the suit patents. 35.5 What persuades
me to decline injunction, in addition to what I have stated above, is also the
fact that in this case damages if proved at trial, appear to be compensable.
The defendants have averred that the plaintiffs have, possibly, licensed their
rights under the suit patents to two entities i.e. Sun and Abbott. The
packaging of the products of the drug sold through these entities is
indicative of this aspect. The plaintiffs, however, for reasons best known to
them have not placed on record the agreements arrived at with these entities
in support of their plea. Therefore, it has to be inferred that the said
entities are licensees.
35.6 Besides this, the plaintiffs also aver that they are importing their drug
into the country. Therefore, the plaintiffs seek to monetize their invention.
Thus, at the end of the trial, if they were to succeed, they could be granted
damages, if proved, under the law. Thus, as long as a mechanism can be put in
place for Signature Not I.A.Verified No. 8826/2020 in CS (COMM) No. 410/2020 &

damages by the plaintiffs, it would, at this stage, balance the interest of
the parties. [See: Dynamic Manufacturing, Inc. vs. David A. Craze, and Miller
Industries, Inc., 1998 WL 241201] PUBLIC INTEREST: -
36\. The parties have also advanced submissions on the aspect concerning
public interest. The plaintiffs have submitted that the quality of the drug
could be an issue. The plaintiffs have also contended that the drug sold by
them is priced reasonably.
36.1 To my mind, this aspect can be quantitatively verified, to a large
extent, if one were to compare the price of the drugs sold by the plaintiffs
both, directly and/or indirectly, and the prices at which the defendants seek
to offer their drugs.

far cheaper. Concerns as to quality, at this juncture, appear to be a self-
serving argument. The concerned statutory authority can, in my view,
adequately deal with this issue if and when such a situation arises.
37\. I may also indicate herein that an argument was raised that diabetes is a
lifestyle disease and, therefore, the concerns generally expressed by Courts
qua drugs which are used to treat life-threatening diseases such as Cancer,
HIV/AIDS etcetera should not impact this matter.
37.1 The defendants on the other hand have emphasised that diabetes is no
longer construed as a lifestyle disease. According to them, given the spread
of Coronavirus, diabetes can cause comorbidity in a patient leading to a
potentially life-threatening situation.
38\. On this aspect, judicial notice needs to be taken of the following
figures published by the Government of India and World Health Organisation on
diabetes.
▪ The National Centre for Disease Control, Directorate General of Health
Service, Government of India, in its "Diabetes Special Edition on Occasion of
World Health Day 2016" [April 2016]4 has noted thus:

▪ The World Health Organisation, in its 'Diabetes Country Profiles, 2016'
concerning India, has noted the following.
38.1 Therefore, if one were to bear in mind the aspect concerning price as
also the nature of the disease which is sought to be treated by the drug-in-
issue, the scales of balance, in my opinion, at this stage, would weigh in
favour of the defendants.
39\. Before I conclude [and dehors what has been observed by me hereinabove],
there is literature and scholarly articles available of well- established
academicians which point in the direction that the doctrine of double
patenting needs to be strengthened.
39.1 Some of the academicians in the US, familiar with patent law, decry the
weakening of double patenting doctrine by the Federal Courts in the country by
disregarding the earlier view of the US Supreme Court which held that
"invention of the genus patent is not determined only by the claims but also

By:VIPIN KUMAR RAI Signing Date:02.11.2020 15:05:16 the embodiments disclosed
in the specifications".
39.2 Some of the academicians appear to be of the view [based on the
precedents of the US Supreme Court and also some Federal Circuit Court
judgements] that it must be presumed that the party with genus patent has
invented the full scope of the genus. It is argued that when the same inventor
holds a genus patent for a pharmaceutical product, such an inventor should be
estopped from obtaining a species patent which is within the scope of genus,
whether or not the genus patent constitutes prior art. [See: O'Reilly vs.
Morse, 56 U.S. 62, 114 (1853); Singer Mfg. Co. vs. Juune Mfg Co., 163 U.S. 169
(1896); and Schriber-Schroth Co. vs. Cleveland Trust Co., 305 U.S. 47 (1938)]
39.3 In this behalf, see the abstract of the article published in Northwestern
Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, Volume 14, Issue 3 (Winter
2017) titled Double Patenting: Follow-on Pharmaceutical Patents that Suppress
Competition, authored by Douglas L. Rogers, which is extracted hereafter.
> "ABSTRACT Prices for pharmaceutical products over the last 10 years have
> skyrocketed, increasing far more rapidly than the general cost of living.
> This article argues there should be greater competition for the production
> of follow-on drugs through the strengthening of the double patenting
> prohibition:
preventing extending exclusive rights beyond the original patent term by
dressing up part of that invention as a new one. This prohibition against the
same party holding two patents covering the same composition announced by the
Supreme Court in the 1800's has been weakened by lower federal courts to (1)
only considering the claims and not the rest of the specification in
determining if the same invention is being claimed by the inventor in two
patents and (2) only applying the prohibition when the earlier patent did not
satisfy the technical meaning of "prior art" within §102 of the Patent Act.
The rulings weakening the double patenting doctrine have disregarded that the
"invention" of a genus patent is not determined only by the claims, but also
by the embodiments disclosed in the specification, and under Supreme Court and
Federal Circuit precedent it must be presumed that the party with a genus
patent has invented the full scope of the genus. These weakening rulings have
also disregarded that the double patenting doctrine arises from §101 of the
patent statutes, rather than §§102 and 103, which the Federal Circuit models
it double patenting test on, often incorrectly concluding there is no double

different purposes than §101. This article argues that when the same inventor
holds a genus patent for a pharmaceutical product, it should be estopped from
obtaining a patent on a species within the scope of the genus, whether or not
the genus patent constitutes prior art. Applying this strengthened double
patenting doctrine would increase competition for the development of follow-on
pharmaceutical products."
Conclusion: -
40\. Thus, for the foregoing reasons I am not inclined to grant an injunction
in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. Consequently, the
captioned applications are dismissed.
41\. The defendants will, however, via their respective affidavits, place on
