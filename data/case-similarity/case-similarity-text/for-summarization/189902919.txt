Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:-
1\. Sole accused Manoj Kumar was sent up for trial in this case for offences
u/s.63 & 68A of Copyright Act, 1957. The case of the prosecution in brief is
that the complainant Naresh Kumar, on behalf of Indian Music Industry (IMI in
short), gave a complaint dated 01.4.1997 in which he alleged that he is a
Senior Investigator of IMI and duly authorised by IMI to take appropriate
action against infringement. It is mentioned in the complaint that certain
persons are doing infringement of audio cassettes and inlay cards. Name of the
person so involved in the infringement is not mentioned nor is the address of
the premises mentioned in the complaint. The complaint is a computer typed
complaint on which only the date of complaint is handwritten and the words
"ACP Crime Branch, Udyog Sadan, New Delhi" is handwritten and remaining
contents are typed. It is further the case of prosecution that pursuant to the
said complaint, a raiding party comprising of investigating officer SI Suresh
Khunga alongwith complainant Naresh, JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR
NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 2 of
14 k Ramesh Kumar and other police officials i.e. HC Ahmed Ali, Ct. Jaipal and
Ct. Ravinder was formed and the said raiding party reached house no.2255,
Sarai Topkhana, Kodia Pool, Delhi, and on entering the house, at the first
floor of the house, accused was found. It is mentioned in the ruqqa that
accused was displaying infringed audio cassettes for sale on racks. Nine
thousand such pirated audio cassettes were allegedly recovered, out of which
nine cassettes were separated as sample and the case property was taken into
police possession. On completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed.
2\. My Ld. Predecessor court on 30.11.2000 framed charges against the accused
for the offence u/s.63 & 68 of Copyright Act, 1957. the accused claimed trial
to the said charge and in support of its case, prosecution examined eight
witnesses namely PW1 Ct. Jaipal, PW2 Sharbati Devi, PW3 Rajiv Sogani, PW4
Ramesh Kumar, PW5 S. Sidhore, PW6 M.H. Khan, PW7 Inspector Suresh Khunja and
PW8 SI Virender Singh.
3\. After the prosecution evidence, entire incriminating evidence was put to
the accused in his examination u/s.313 r/w section 281 Cr.P.C, to which the
accused generally denied stating that he has been falsely implicated in this
case. Accused initially stated that he wants to lead defence evidence, but
vide a separate statement dated 28.8.2009, the accused closed his defence
evidence without leading any defence evidence.
4\. Out of the eight witnesses examined by the prosecution, JUDGMENT/STATE VS.
MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 /
Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 3 of 14 k PW2, PW3, PW5, PW6 and PW8 are all formal
witnesses.
PW3 Rajiv Sogani proved the assignment agreement regarding the assignment of
copyright of movies 'Raja Hindustani' and 'Hero No.1' and also their copyright
as Ex.
PW3/A to Ex.PW3/D.
PW5 S. Sidhore was the Secretary General of IMI, who proved that he authorised
the complainant Naresh Kumar to take legal action against the accused and
others vide authority letter Ex. PW5/A.
PW6 SI M.H. Khan was the Duty Officer, who proved the FIR Ex. PW6/A.
PW8 SI Virender Singh collected the electricity and water bills belonging to
PW2 Sharbati Devi and regarding proof of ownership of premises from where
recovery was effected.
5\. PW2 Smt. Sharbati Devi deposed that on 26.3.1997, the accused put certain
cassettes at her house which were taken into police possession by the police
on 01.4.1997 and she also proved the electricity bill, water bill and copy of
ration card as Ex. PW2/A to PW2/C to prove her ownership of the premises
no.2255, Sarai Topkhana, Kodia Pool, Delhi. In the cross examination, PW2
stated that she does not know the person, who left the cassettes at her
premises. The testimony of this witness is not of any importance to the case
of prosecution for the reason that she did not say as to whether the accused
was tenant of this witness in JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR
NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 4 of
14 k the said premises and in what the capacity, the accused was present, if
at all on 26.3.1997 and on 01.4.1997. She was not shown the case property to
identify that the case property alleged to be recovered from the accused was
the same case property which this witness wants the Court to believe that it
was recovered by the police from her premises. In absence of identification of
case property by this witness, absolutely no inference can be drawn against
the accused. Not only this, if it was the case of prosecution that this
witness was present at the time of recovery of infringed articles from the
accused, nothing prevented the prosecution to have obtained signatures of this
witness on the recovery memo Ex. PW4/A, but Ex. PW4/A does not bear signatures
of PW2 Sharbati Devi. Even otherwise, PW2 Sharbati Devi in her statement
u/s.161 Cr.P.C claimed that she was not present in the house when the recovery
was effected. Therefore, testimony of PW2 that any cassettes were recovered
cannot be accepted and it is nothing more than hearsay.
6\. Besides the above witnesses, prosecution examined three recovery witnesses
i.e. PW1 Ct. Jaipal Singh, PW4 Ramesh Kumar and PW7 Inspector Suresh Khunga.
7\. PW1 Ct. Jaipal when appeared in the court, did not support the case of
prosecution and instead stated that he does JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/
FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 5
of 14 k not know anything about this case. This witness was declared hostile
by the Ld. APP and was cross examined. Even during cross examination of this
witness, nothing material could be taken out against the accused. In the cross
examination, this witness stated that it was correct to suggest that he took
ruqqa for registration of FIR to PS Kotwali and that it was correct to suggest
that personal search of accused Ex. PW1/A bears his signatures and accused was
personally searched in his presence. Besides admission of these suggestions,
this witness nowhere deposed that any infringed articles were recovered from
the possession of accused nor the infringed articles were shown to this
witness to be identified that they were the same articles which were recovered
from the accused. Thus, testimony of PW1 is also of no help to the case of
prosecution.
8\. Turning to the testimony of PW4 Ramesh Kumar, he supported the case of
prosecution alongwith PW7 investigating officer Inspector Suresh Khunga and
both of them deposed that on 01.4.1997, recovery as alleged was effected from
the house no.2255, Sarai Topkhana, where the accused was present and those
cassettes were infringed cassettes.
9\. PW4 specifically mentioned that they raided the house of accused on a
secret information. But what is interesting is that no such secret information
finds JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright
Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 6 of 14 k mention in the ruqqa Ex.
PW7/C. Another interesting aspect of this matter is that this Ramesh Kumar
s/o. Balraj Singh is the real brother of complainant Naresh Kumar. The witness
PW4 in his testimony nowhere deposed that in the house from where recovery was
effected, the cassettes were in any manner displayed for sale or offered for
sale. It is not the case of prosecution that any duplicating equipment/plate
was recovered from the said house. When the case property was produced for the
first time in the Court in the testimony of PW4, it was without intact seals.
The witness PW4 admitted in his cross examination that when the case property
was produced, it was in torn condition and the gunny bags were also torn. PW4
in the cross examination even stated that when they left for the house of
accused, they carried gunny bags alongwith them. It means that they had prior
information about the accused and his residence, then what prevented the
prosecution and the investigating agency to mention the premises number and
the name of accused in the records. Absence of the same creates a very serious
doubt.
10\. Similarly, PW7 also nowhere deposed that audio cassettes recovered
allegedly from the accused were displayed for sale/hire. PW7 confronted PW4 by
saying that complainant did not disclose the address of place JUDGMENT/STATE
VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 /
Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 7 of 14 k of recovery or name of accused nor it was
mentioned in the complaint. Admittedly, the place where recovery was effected
is a house and not shop. PW7 claimed that gunny bags were already lying in the
room from where recovery was effected.
11\. So far as offence u/s.68A of Copyright, 1957, is concerned, the same is
not made out against the accused for the reason that it is nobody's case that
cinematograph films and sound recordings were published within the meaning of
section 3 of Copyright Act.
12\. Section 52A of Copyright Act, 1957 provides that no person shall publish
a sound recording in respect of any work unless particulars as mentioned in
Sub-section (1) Clause (a) i.e. name and address of the person who made the
sound recording; name and address of the owner of the copyright in such work;
and year of its first publication are displayed on the sound recording or any
container thereof.
13\. The necessary ingredient of section 52A of Copyright Act is publication
of a sound recording and when these particulars are lacking, a person shall be
guilty for 68A of Copyright Act.
14\. What is publication is defined in Section (3) of the Copyright Act, 1957
and it says, that for the purposes of this Act, "publication" means making a
work available to the JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A
of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 8 of 14 k public by issue
of copies or by communicating the work to the public.
15\. The word communication of a work to the public is defined in Section 2
(ff) of the Act which says that "Communication to the public" means making any
work available for being seen or hear or otherwise enjoyed by the public
directly or by any means of display or diffusion other than by issuing copies
of such work regardless of whether any member of the public actually sees,
hears, or otherwise enjoys the work so made available.
16\. In the present case, admittedly none of the VCD/CD allegedly recovered
from the possession of accused were published within the meaning of section 2
(ff) and section 3 of the Act. Nor accused is alleged to have issued any
copies thereof to the public.
17\. Coming to the offence u/s.63 of Copyright Act, 1957, the offence of
infringement is defined in section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and it is
punishable u/s.63 Copyright Act, 1957.
18\. Infringement is defined in Section 51 of Copyright Act and it states that
Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed when any person, without a
licence granted by the owner of the copyright or, by Registrar of Copyrights
does anything, the exclusive rights to do which is by the Act conferred upon
the owner of the copyright of the said Act. It JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/
FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 9
of 14 k further provides that copyright shall be deemed to be infringed if any
person makes for sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade
displays or offers for sale or hire any infringing copies of the work. It also
provides that when any person distributes for the purposes of trade any
infringing copies, it shall be deemed infringement. Admittedly, Clause (a)
Section 51 and sub clause (iii) and (iv) of Clause (b) of section 51 are not
applicable in this case.
19\. What are the exclusive rights of a copyright holder, is defined in
Section 14 (1) (d), in the case of cinematograph film, and it says that
copyright in a cinematograph film means, exclusive rights to make copy of film
including the photographs of an image; to sell or give on hire or offer for
sale or hire any copy of the film; and to communicate the film to the public.
Similarly, section 14 (1) (e) provides the exclusive rights given to a
copyright holder, in case of sound recording. Therefore in order to prove
infringement it was incumbent on the prosecution to show that accused did
anything, the exclusive rights to which vested with the copyright holder, or,
the prosecution ought to have proved that accused sold or gave on hire or by
way of trade displayed or offered for sale or hire the infringing copies.
20\. Section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 makes punishable an offence of
infringement when a person knowingly infringes the copyright in a work. The
word 'knowing infringes' is of great JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR
NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 10 of
14 k significance, which requires active mens rea present.
21\. In the case of 1994 CRI. L. J. 2469 in the case of A. K. Mukherjee v.
State Hon'ble DELHI HIGH COURT held as follows;
" 8. A bare perusal of the provision would go to show that emphasis is on the
words "knowingly infringes.... the Copyrights in a work." These words clearly
postulate a knowledge on the part of the accused that he was infringing the
Copyright in a work. Mere possibility of his having known it would not
suffice. There has to be clear and conclusive proof of the requisite
knowledge. Even the existence of reasonable means of knowing would not be
enough. In short thus the use of the work "knowingly" in the provision results
in requiring "mens rea in the full sense" [See Prof. J.C. Smity, "The Guilty
Mind in the Criminal Law" 1960 Law Quarterly Review Vo. 76,p. 79]. This in
short being the legal requirement under Section 63 of the Copy-right Board,
evidence shall have to be led to bring home the required guilty knowledge."
22\. In the present case, none of the three recovery witnesses have deposed
that case property which was recovered from the possession of accused was in
any manner displayed for sale or hire in the premises from where it was
recovered. Admittedly the place of recovery is a house and not a shop. In such
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act,
1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 11 of 14 k circumstances, even otherwise, it
is highly unlikely that the case property was displayed for sale. It is
nobody's case that the accused reproduced those audio cassettes or made for
sale those audio cassettes, no prosecution witness has deposed that the
accused made the audio cassettes for sale. No duplicating equipment/plate is
recovered from the possession of accused which could have shown that the
accused reproduced/made audio cassettes for sale/hire. In such circumstances,
necessary ingredients of section 51 of Copyright Act, 1957, it defines
infringement is not fulfilled.
23\. Even otherwise, as mentioned above in the present case, despite
availability of independent witnesses, no independent witness is joined from
the locality where the search was effected. Even the house owner PW2 Sharbati
Devi, was not joined as a witness in the seizure memo and she did not sign the
same. Both Naresh Kumar and Ramesh Kumar are brothers and, therefore, their
testimony has to be taken with pinch of salt. There is no denial of fact by
the prosecution that these witnesses have appeared in a number of cases of IPR
violation and they are witnesses in a number of such raids. In such
circumstances, there is absolute non compliance of section 100 Cr.P.C. Sub Sec
(4) of Sec 100 of the Criminal Procedure Code specifically provides that
whenever any search or seizure is effected by an investigating officer, the
investigating officer before making search or seizure shall join at least two
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MANOJ KUMAR/ FIR NO.385/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act,
1957 / Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 12 of 14 k independent respectable local
inhabitants from the same locality in which search is to be effected. Again
the word used in sub Sec (4) of Sec 100 is "shall" which makes it mandatory.
An investigating officer is granted liberty to join independent witnesses from
other locality only when the witnesses from the same locality are either not
available or they refuse to become witness. It appears that no sincere effort
was made to join local respectable witness from the same locality before
making search and seizure .
24\. Even provisions of section 64 of Copyright Act, 1957 not complied with.
Besides this, there is non-compliance of section 64 of Copyright Act. The
Copyright Act 1957, in the Sec 64, specifically provides that whenever any
search and seizure is effected by an investigating officer pertaining to
infringed articles, the said recovered infringed articles should be produced
immediately before a class one magistrate. The word used in the Sec is "shall"
which makes it mandatory. But in the present case admittedly the case property
was not produced before the class one magistrate immediately after its
seizure.
25\. This fact assumes importance particularly when the case property produced
in the Court for the first time in the testimony of PW4 was without legible
seal and seals were not intact.
26\. The Investigating Agency even failed to prove the DD entry JUDGMENT/STATE

Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 13 of 14 k of the departure and the arrival of the
police officials to lend credence to their case.
27\. All these facts create a very serious doubt about the genuineness of case
of prosecution and benefit of same goes to the accused. Accordingly, accused
is acquitted to the charges. Surety bond and personal bond of the accused
stands cancelled. His surety is discharged. Endorsement, if any on the

u/s.63 & 68A of Copyright Act, 1957. The case of the prosecution in brief is
that the complainant Naresh Kumar, on behalf of Indian Music Industry (IMI in
short), gave a complaint dated 01.4.1997 in which he alleged that he is a
Senior Investigator of IMI and duly authorised by IMI to take appropriate
action against infringement. It is mentioned in the complaint that certain
persons are doing infringement of audio cassettes and inlay cards. Name of the
person so involved in the infringement is not mentioned nor is the address of
immediately before a class one magistrate. The word used in the Sec is "shall"
which makes it mandatory. But in the present case admittedly the case property
was not produced before the class one magistrate immediately after its
seizure.
25\. This fact assumes importance particularly when the case property produced
in the Court for the first time in the testimony of PW4 was without legible
seal and seals were not intact.
26\. The Investigating Agency even failed to prove the DD entry JUDGMENT/STATE

Acquitted/01.9.2009 /Page 13 of 14 k of the departure and the arrival of the
police officials to lend credence to their case.
27\. All these facts create a very serious doubt about the genuineness of case
of prosecution and benefit of same goes to the accused. Accordingly, accused
is acquitted to the charges. Surety bond and personal bond of the accused
stands cancelled. His surety is discharged. Endorsement, if any on the
documents stand cancelled. File is consigned to Record Room.
