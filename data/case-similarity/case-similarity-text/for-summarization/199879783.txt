    2.4    Assessee has selected Transaction Net Margin Method (TNMM)
as the most appropriate method and also applied multiple year data to select
the comparables. It had selected 23 comparables. Though, TPO has accepted the
TNMM as the most appropriate method, he rejected the TP study of assessee and
has made fresh TP study with data for the FY 2007-08. TPO had selected the
above 19 comparables.
2.5 After comparing the average margins of the comparables to the financials
of the assessee, the TPO computed the adjusted arm's length margin as under:
> Arithmetic Mean of PLI as arrived at by the TPO : 26.20% Add: Negative
> working capital adjustment : 0.27% Arm's length margin as arrived at by the
> TPO : 26.47% 2.6 Accordingly, the TPO who passed an order u/s 92CA(3) of the
> Act on 24/10/2011, recommended adjustment of Rs. 3,55,03,343/-.
The same was incorporated by the AO in the draft assessment order. Assessee
preferred a petition before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DR) raising various
objections.
3\. DRP has given partial relief to the assessee as under:
3.1 The DRP has eliminated the company M/s Celestial Biolabs Ltd. as
comparable, as it is engaged in research activities which results in
development of proprietary products and services for specific sectors. It
provides contract research services and is also diversified into marketing and
manufacturing activities. It is recognized as a research facility by the Dept.
of Scientific and Industrial Research, GOI. Thus,  4 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012
United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
the functional profile of Celestial is very much different from the assessee
company.
3.2 Considering the above findings of DRP, the AO has reduced the adjustment
u/s 92CA to Rs. 2,61,59,851/-.
4\. Aggrieved with the above order, assessee is in appeal before us.
5\. Grounds raised by the assessee are as under:
> TRANSFER PRICING MATTERS - Relating to determination of Arm's Length Price
> ("ALP") in respect of provision of software services to Associated
> Enterprises (" AEs") under Transactional Net Margin Method ("TNMM") Based on

8\. The assessee has not pressed the grounds raised above except ground No. 8
and additional grounds. Therefore, all other grounds are rejected as not
pressed.
9\. The ld. AR objected to the selection of following comparables by the TPO.
Therefore, we will deal with each of the company that was objected by the
assessee.
1\. Infosys Technologies Ltd.
1.1 The ld. AR objecting to the aforesaid company being treated as comparable,
relied on the decision of the ITAT, Hyderabad in assessee's own case for AY
2007-08 and 2005-06.
1.2 The ITAT in AY 2007-08 vide ITA No. 1658/H/2011 and others held as
follows:
> "7.2.3. We have considered the submissions of the parties and perused the
> materials on record. On considering the same, we are of the view that this
> company cannot be considered as comparable to Assessee due to various
> factors such as its size, turnover, brand value, scale of operation,
> diversified activities and owning of intangibles. As can be seen from the TP
> order, the turnovers of Infosys Technologies Limited during the year under
> consideration are Rs.13,149 crores as against Rs. 42 crores of Assessee.
> Though it is a fact that Assessee in the TP documentation, has selected
> Infosys Technologies Ltd. as comparable but that cannot prevent Assessee
> from objecting to the aforesaid company being selected as comparable, if
> there are valid reasons for doing so. In this context, the contention of the
> learned AR that Assessee has selected Infosys Limited on the basis of three
> 8 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> years financial data, whereas the TPO considered only the current year data
> also needs to be appreciated. Therefore, considering the enormity of
> turnover of the company as well as other relevant factors, the aforesaid
> company cannot be treated as comparable to Assessee in any manner. This view
> of ours is also in tune with the view expressed by different Benches of this
> Tribunal as stated below as well as that of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
> the case of CIT Vs. Agnity India Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,[2013] 85 CCH 146.
> a) M/s. Foursoft Limited (ITA.No.1903/H/2011) b) M/s. Conexant System India
> P. Ltd. ITA.1978/H2011 c) M/s. Virtusa (I) P. Ltd. ITA.No.1962/Hyd/2011 d)
> Telcordia Technologies India P. Ltd. ITA.7821/Mum/2011 e) Triology
> E-Business Solutions ITA.No.1054/Bang/2011 f) Adaptec (India) P. Ltd. vs.
> DCIT ITA.No.1801/Hyd/2009 g) Trinity Advanced Software Labs P. Ltd. vs. ACIT
> ITA.No.1129/Hyd/2005.
> We therefore direct the Assessing Officer /TPO to exclude this while
> computing ALP.
1.3 The ITAT in AY 2005-06 in assessee's own case for AY 2005-06 vide ITA No.
1480/H/10 and others held as follows:
> "15. We have heard submissions of the parties and perused the materials on
> record. So far as Infosys Technologies Ltd. is concerned the issue of
> comparability of the aforesaid company has been considered by different
> Benches of the Tribunal including the Hyderabad Benches. It is to be noted
> that the consistent view of different Benches of the Tribunal is to the
> effect that Infosys Technologies Ltd. being a big company in all respects
> including the range of turnover is not a comparable to small companies which
> are captive service providers having considerably low turnover. In fact, the
> Hon'ble Delhi Court in a judgement dated 19.7.2013 in the case of Agnity
> India Ltd. upheld the decision of ITAT Delhi Bench in excluding Infosys
> Technologies Ltd., as a comparable in view of its size. Therefore, keeping
> in tune with the consistent view of different Benches of the Tribunal in
> respect of the aforesaid company, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the
> aforesaid company from the list of comparables."
1.4 The ld. AR also placed reliance on the following decisions:
1\. Invensys Development Centre India Pvt. Ltd., 1692/H/12 AY 2008-09
2\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd, (TS-359-ITAT-2013(Bang)-
TP) AY 2008-09.
3\. Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 5848/D/12 - AY 2008-09.
9
ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
1.5 The ld. DR, on the other hand relied on the orders of revenue authorities.
1.6. After considering the submissions of both the parties and keeping in tune
with the consistent view of different benches of the Tribunal in respect of
the aforesaid, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the aforesaid company from the
list of comparables.
2\. Kals Information Systems Ltd., 2.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as
comparable, the AR of the assessee relied on the decision of ITAT in
assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 wherein the tribunal held as follows:
> 7.9. As far as Kals Information System Limited is concerned, learned Counsel
> for Assessee submitted that it is functionally different from Assessee. In
> support of his contention, the learned Counsel for Assessee relied upon the
> decision of the Bangalore Tribunal in the case M/s. Trilogy E-Business
> Software India Private Limited (supra) wherein at paras 46 and 47 of its
> order, the Tribunal has discussed the functional dissimilarity with Assessee
> therein and has directed that the company should be excluded from the list
> of comparables. Similarly, the Tribunal at Bangalore in the case of M/s. HCL
> EAI Services Ltd. vs. DCIT IT(TP) A. No. 1348/ Bang/2011 at para 17 at pages
> 24 to 26 of its order has discussed at length the reasons for not
> considering the said company as comparable to software development services
> company. The relevant portion of the order is reproduced hereunder :
> (d) KALS Information Systems Ltd.
> 46\. As far as this company is concerned, the contention of Assessee is that
> the aforesaid company has revenues from both software development and
> software products. Besides the above, it was also pointed out that this
> company is engaged in providing training. It was also submitted that as per
> the annual report, the salary cost debited under the software development
> expenditure was Rs.45,93,351. The same was less than 25% of the software
> services revenue and therefore the salary cost filter test fails in this
> case. Reference was made to the Pune Bench Tribunal's decision of the ITAT
> in the case of Bindview India Private Limited Vs. DCI, ITA No. ITA No
> 1386/PN/1O wherein KALS as comparable was rejected for AY 2006-07 on account
> of it being functionally different from software companies. The relevant
> extract are as follows:
> "16. Another issue relating to selection of comparables by the TPO is
> regarding inclusion of Kals Information System Ltd. Assessee has objected to
> its inclusion on the basis that functionally the company is not comparable.
> With reference to pages 185-186 of the Paper Book, it is explained that the
> said company is engaged in development of software  10 ITA No. 1720
> /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> products and services and is not comparable to software development services
> provided by Assessee. The appellant has submitted an extract on pages
> 185-186 of the Paper Book from the website of the company to establish that
> it is engaged in providing of I T enabled services and that the said company
> is into development of software products, etc. All these aspects have not
> been factually rebutted and, in ITA No.1658/Hyd/2011 & 1239/Hyd/2013 M/s.
> United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad 19 our view,
> the said concern is liable to be excluded from the final set of comparables,
> and thus on this aspect, assessee succeeds."
> Based on all the above, it was submitted on behalf of Assessee that KALS
> Information Systems Limited should be rejected as a comparable.
> 47\. We have given a careful consideration to the submission made on behalf

2.2 Ld. AR also relied on the decision of Invensys Development Centre India
Pvt. Ltd., 1692/H/12 AY 2008-09, wherein the Tribunal held as follows:

> 2.. Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 5848/D/12 - AY 2008-09.
2.4 Ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities. 2.5 In view of the
above, in line with the decisions of the various benches of this Tribunal, we
hold that this company is to be omitted from the list of comparable companies.
3\. Tata Elxsi Ltd. (Seg.) 3.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as
comparable, the ld. AR relied on the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's
own case for AY 2007-08 wherien the Tribunal held as follows:
> "7.7 From the facts and material on record and submissions made by the
> learned AR, it is seen that the Tata Elxsi is engaged in development of

> ALP."
3.2 Ld. AR also relied on the decision of the Tribunal in case of Invensys
Development Centre India Pvt. Ltd., (supra) wherein the it has held as
follows:
> "4.5.4 We have heard both parties and carefully perused and considered the
> material on record. From the details on record, we find that this company is
> predominantly engaged in product designing services and not purely software
> development services. The details in the Annual Report show that the segment

> similar to software development services performed by assessee.
> 4.5.5 The Hon'ble Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Telecordia Technologies
> India Pvt. Ltd. V ACIT (ITA No.7821/Mum/2011) has held that Tata Elxsi Ltd.

3.3 Ld. AR also relied on the following decisions:

3.4 Ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities.
3.5 In view of the above, in line with the decision of the various benches of
this Tribunal, we direct the AO to exclude this company as comparable.
4\. Wipro Ltd., 4.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as comparable, the AR
relied on the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY 2007-08
wherein the bench held as follows:
> 4.6.1. This company was selected as a comparable by the TPO. Before the TPO,
> the assessee had objected to the inclusion of this company in the list of
> comparables on several grounds like functional dissimilarity, brand value,
> size, etc. The TPO, however, brushed aside the objections of the assessee
> and included this company in the set of comparables.
> 4.6.2 Before us, the learned Authorised Representative of the assessee
> contended that this company i.e. Wipro Ltd., is not functionally comparable
> to the assessee for the following reasons :-
> (i) This company owns significant intangibles in the nature of customer
> related intangibles and technology related intangibles, owns IPRs and has
> been granted 40 registered patents and has 62 pending applications and its
> Annual Report confirms that it owns patents and intangibles.
> (ii) the ITAT, Delhi observation in the case of Agnity India Technologies
> Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No.3856(Del)/2010 at para 5.2 thereof, that Infosys
> Technologies Ltd. being a giant company and a market leader assuming all

> is not functionally comparable to a software service provider.
> (iv) Wipro Ltd. is engaged in both software development and product

ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
4.4 In view of the above, we hold that this company cannot be considered as a
comparable to the assessee. We, therefore, direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to
omit this company from the set of comparable companies.
5\. AVANI CINCOM TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED :
5.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as comparable, the ld. AR of the
assessee submitted that this company is into software products and company's
website gives details that company develops and sells customized software
solutions like DX change, CARMA, etc. and relied on the decision of the
Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 wherein the Tribunal held as
follows:
> 7.1. Assessee has basically sought exclusion of above company on two
> grounds, firstly, this company has revenue from both product and software
> services and segment-wise data is not available and secondly, it is
> contended that the company has shown super normal profit of 52.59% against
> average margin of other comparables. It is very much evident from the TP
> order that Assessee has been categorised as a software development service
> provider. Coordinate Bench of this Tribunal in the case of Virtusa (India)
> Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No. 1962/Hyd/2011 dated 30/08/2013) after following some
> other decisions of the Tribunal has held this company cannot be treated as
> comparable as this company is also into product development. As segmental
> details of operating income of software development services and sale of
> software products are not available, it could not be ascertained whether the
> profit ratio of this company can be taken into consideration for comparing
> with Assessee. As the aforesaid decision of the Coordinate Bench pertained
> to the same assessment year i.e. A.Y. 2007-08, following the same, we hold
> that this company cannot be treated as comparable to Assessee. Other cases
> considered the same comparable and rejected are as under:

5.2 The AR also relied on the decision of the ITAT Hyderabad in case of
Invensys Development Centre P. Ltd. (supra) wherein the coordinate bench held
as follows:
> "4.1.4 We have heard both parties and perused and carefully, considered the
> material on record. It is seen from the record that the TPO has included
> this company in the final set of comparables only on the basis of
> information obtained under section 133(6) of the Act. We also find
> substantial merit 6 ITA.No.1692/Hyd/2012 M/s. Invensys Development Centre
> India (P) Ltd., Hyderabad. in the contention of the learned Authorised
> Representative that this company has been selected by the TPO as an
> additional comparable only on the ground that this company was selected in
> the earlier year. Apart from placing reliance on the judicial decisions
> cited above, including assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007-08,
> assessee has brought on record evidence that this company is functionally
> dissimilar and different from assessee and hence is not comparable.
> Therefore the finding excluding it from the list of comparables rendered in
> the immediately preceding year is applicable in this year also. Since the
> functional profile and other parameters by this company have not undergone
> any change during the year under consideration which fact has been
> demonstrated by assessee, following the decisions of the co-ordinate benches

5.3 The ld. AR also relied on the following cases:
> 1\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd, (TS-359-ITAT-2013(Bang)-
> TP) AY 2008-09.
> 2.. Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 5848/D/12 - AY 2008-09.
5.4 Following the above decisions, as the company is functionally dissimilar
and different from the assessee, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said
company from the list of comparables.
17
ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
6\. Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. (Seg.) 6.1 The ld. AR objecting to the said
company as comparable, relied upon the decision of the ITAT, Hyderabad in
assessee's own case for AY 2005-06 wherein the Bench held as follows:
> "20. The Learned AR submitted that since the aforesaid company fails the RPT
> filter it cannot be treated as a comparable. The learned DR supported the
> order of the TPO.
> 21\. We have considered the submissions of the parties and perused the
> materials on record. The ground on which the learned AR seeks for exclusion
> of the aforesaid company is, its related party transaction as a percentage
> to the total revenue is 34.68% which is more than the accept/reject matrix
> of more than 25% fixed by the TPO. It is to be noted that in final filters
> adopted by the TPO in para 9.7 of his order he himself has excluded
> companies having RPT of more than 25%. We, therefore, direct the Assessing
> Officer/TPO to examine this aspect and exclude it from the list of
> comparables if the assessee's contention is found to be correct.
6.2 The ld. AR also relied upon the following cases:
1\. ITAT Delhi in case of Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No. 5848/D/2012 for
AY 2008-09 6.3 It is to be noted that in the case of 3DPLM Software Solutions
Ltd, (TS-359-ITAT-2013(Bang)-TP) AY 2008-09, the coordinate bench has taken
this company as comparable.
6.4 Ld. AR submitted that this company is engaged in providing open and end to
end web solutions, software consultancy, design and development of software
and also submitted that this is into business of software products. For that
he submitted snap shot of companies profile from the net in page 561 of the
paper book, which states as "we also provide product engineering and
enterprise services to Fortune 500 firms and SMES". Also "As a partner of
industry leading technology providers, Bodhtree delivers best-in-class
solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of global SME's and fortune
listed organizations". Ld AR also submitted a letter from Chartered
Accountats, M/s Gokhale & Co., which is addressed to ACIT (TP),  18 ITA No.
1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Hyderabad (Refer pages 563 & 564 of the paper book). M/s Gokhale & Co.,
submits details about the Bodhtree e paper solutions.
6.5 After analyzing the above submissions, we are of the view that the
submissions on profile of the company, it is mentioned as "we also provide
product engineering and enterprise services to fortune 500 firms". This also
will be categorized as software services and cannot be categorized as software
product. The auditor of this company submitted the letter before TPO, which
was part of assessment proceedings. These submissions are made by ld. AR as
additional evidence and we direct AO/TPO to analyse this comparable with the
submissions of the assessee after giving them an opportunity of being heard.
In case, this comparable is found to be into software products, it may be
eliminated from the list of comparables.
7\. E-Zest Solutions Ltd.
7.1 Objecting to the said company as comparable as this company is engaged in
e-business consultancy services and also in BPO services, the ld. AR relied on
the decision of the coordinate bench of Hyderabad in case of Invensys
Development Centre P. Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as follows:
> "4.2.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused carefully the
> material on record. It is seen from the record that the TPO has included
> this company in the list of comparables only on the basis of the statement
> made by the company in its reply to the notice under section 133(6) of the
> Act. It appears that the TPO has not examined the services rendered by the
> company to give a finding whether the services performed by this company are
> similar to the software development services performed by assessee. From the
> details on record, we find that while assessee is into software development
> services, this company i.e. e-Zest Solutions Ltd., is rendering product
> development services and high end technical services which come under the
> category of KPO services. It has been held by the co-ordinate bench of this
> Tribunal in the cases of Capital I-Q Information Systems (India) (P) Ltd.
> that KPO services are not comparable to software development services and
> are therefore  19 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development

> not comparable. Further, the decisions of the coordinate bench in the
> aforesaid cases of (i) Agnity India Technologies P. Ltd., vs. DCIT, Circle
> 1(1), New Delhi ITA.No.6485/Del/2012 dated 20th September, 2013 and (ii)

> Bangalore vs. DCIT, Circle 11(1), Bangalore I.T.(T.P.)A.No.1303/ Bang / 2012
> dated 28.11.2013, we hold that this company, i.e. e-Zest Solutions Ltd. be
> excluded from the set of comparables.
7.2 The ld. AR also relied on the decision in the case of 3DPLM Software
Solutions Ltd, (TS-359-ITAT-2013(Bang)-TP) AY 2008-09.
7.3 Ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities.
7.4 Respectfully following the above, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said
company from the list of comparables as comparable.
8\. LGS Global Ltd.
8.1 Objecting to the said company as comparable, ld. AR submitted that this
company is offering services in consultancy services, BPO, testing services
and application maintenance outsourcing. Further, this company has capital
work-in-progress towards capitalized software and product development cost. In
principle, software products cannot be considered as comparables for software
services company. The ld. AR relied upon the decision of the ITAT Delhi Bench
in case of Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as
follows:
> 15\. As regards the argument of Ld. A.R. regarding exclusion of LGS Global
> Ltd., Avani Cincon, Kals Information Systems and Bothtree Consultants, we
> are of the opinion that the company having similar functions can only be
> compared with the assessee and as per various decisions of the Tribunal as
> relied upon by the Ld. A.R., these companies were into development of the
> product also in addition to the business of providing services.
> 16\. Ld. D.R. had argued that the TPO had taken segmental figures only to
> make the comparison. Therefore, we hold that this  20 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012
> United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> issue can be examined by the Assessing Officer afresh to ascertain as to
> whether segmental data relating to the provision of services were used or
> consolidated results were used for making comparison.
> 17\. As regards the last argument of the Ld. A.R. regarding inclusion of
> finance and bank charges in operating expenses while computing the margin
> and comparables, we are in agreement with the argument of the Ld. A.R. that
> finance and bank charges form part of operating expenses and need to be
> included while calculating margin of comparables.
> 18\. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances of the present case
> and in view of the discussions made above and in view of various judicial
> pronouncements, we direct the Assessing Officer to re-adjudicate the issue
> of arms length pricing and determine the same by excluding the comparables
> having turnover of more than Rs.200 crores. The Assessing Officer will also
> take into account the bank and finance charges as part of operating expenses
> of com parables for arriving at the margin. Similarly, Assessing Officer
> will only take segmental results relating to services only for comparing the
> companies Ws. Kals Information Systems, Avani Cincon, LGS GLobal Ltd. and
> Bodhtree Consulting Systems as the consolidated results of these companies
> cannot be compared with the assessee, as assessee is admittedly into service
> providing activities. It is further directed that if segmental results of
> the above companies relating to similar services as being provided by
> assessee are not available, then these companies will have to be excluded as
> comparables as held in various judicial pronouncements relied upon by Ld.
> A.R .
8.2 In view of the above and also ld. AR submitted that the revenue in FY
2007-08 is three times higher than the revenue of FY 2006-07. We direct the AO
to apply the turnover filter and exclude the companies whose turnover are more
than 200 crores. Since, we do not have segmental report, we direct AO to
determine the service and product details from this company and if in case it
is found that it is into product, this company will have to be excluded from
the list of comparables.
9\. Persistent Systems Ltd.
9.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as comparable, ld. AR submitted that
this company is engaged in software product designing  21 ITA No. 1720
/Hyd/2012 United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
and analytical services. It has also expenditure in R&D. The ld. AR relied on
the decision of the coordinate bench of ITAT Bangalore in case of 3DPLM
Software Solutions Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as follows:
> 17.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully
> considered the material on record. It is seen from the details on record
> that this company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd., is engaged in product
> development and product design services while the assessee is a software
> development services provider. We find that, as submitted by the assessee,
> the segmental details are not given separately. Therefore, following the
> principle enunciated in the decision of the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of
> Telecordia 41 IT(T.P)A No.1303/Bang/2012 Technologies India Pvt. Ltd.
> (supra) that in the absence of segmental details / information a company
> cannot be taken into account for comparability analysis, we hold that this
> company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd. ought to be omitted from the set of
> comparables for the year under consideration. It is ordered accordingly.
9.2 Ld. AR also relied on the decision in the case of Cash Edge India Pvt.

9.3 Ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities. 9.4 Respectfully
following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said company
as comparable from the list of comparables.
10\. Qunitegra Solutions Ltd.
10.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as comparable, the ld. AR relied on
the decision of the coordinate bench of ITAT Banlgaore in case of IDPLM
Software Solutions Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as follows:
> "18.3.1 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully
> considered the material on record. It is seen from the details brought on
> record that this company i.e. Quintegra Solutions Ltd. is engaged in product
> engineering services and is not purely a software development service
> provider as is the assessee in the case on hand. It is also seen that this
> company is also engaged in proprietary software products and has substantial
> R&D activity which has resulted in creation of its IPRs. Having applied for
> trade mark registration of its products, it  22 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012
> United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> evidences the fact that this company owns intangible assets. The co-ordinate
> bench of this Tribunal in thecase of 24/7 Customer.Com Pvt. Ltd. (ITA
> No.227/Bang/2010 dt.9.11.2012) has held that if a company possesses or owns
> intangibles or IPRs, then it cannot be considered as a comparable company to
> one that does not own intangibles and requires to be omitted form the list
> of comparables, as in the case on hand. 18.3.2 We also find from the Annual
> Report of Quintegra Solutions Ltd. that there have been acquisitions made by
> it in the period under consideration. It is settled principle that where
> extraordinary events have taken place, which has an effect on the
> performance of the company, then that company shall be removed from the list
> of comparables.
> 18.3.3 Respectfully following the decision of the co-ordinate bench of the
> Tribunal in the case of 24/7 Customer.Com Pvt. Ltd. (supra), we direct that
> this company i.e. Quintegra Solutions Ltd. be excluded from the list of
> comparables in the case on hand since it is engaged in proprietary software
> products and owns its own intangibles unlike the assessee in the case on
> hand who is a software service provider."
10.2 Respectfully following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude
the said company as comparable from the list of comparables.
11\. Softsol India Ltd.
11.1 Objecting to the said company as comparable, the ld. AR relied on the
decision of coordinate bench of ITAT Banglaore in case of 3DPLM Software
solutions Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as follows:
> 19.2 Per contra, the learned Departmental Representative supported the
> action of the TPO in including this company in the list of comparables as
> this company was a pure software development service provider like the
> assessee. 19.3 We have heard both parties and perused and carefully
> considered the material on record. We find that the co-ordinate bench of
> this Tribunal in the assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007-08 in ITA
> No.845/Bang/2011 has excluded this company from the set of comparables for
> the reason that RPT is in excess of 15% following the decision of another
> bench of this Tribunal in the case of 24/7 Customer.Com Pvt. Ltd. in ITA
> No.227/Bang/2011. As the facts for this year are  23 ITA No. 1720 /Hyd/2012
> United Online Software Development (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> similar and material on record also indicates that RPT is 18.3%, following
> the afore cited decisions of the co-ordinate benches (supra), we hold that
> this company is to be omitted from the list of comparables to the assessee
> in the case on hand."
11.2 Ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities.
11.3 Respectfully following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude
the said company as comparable from the list of companies.
