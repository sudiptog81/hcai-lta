By this order, above mentioned two writ petitions,which involve the same
question of law and similar facts are being decided. For the purpose of this
order facts are being taken from CWP No.25646 of 2014.
The grievance which is being raised in the present writ petition 1 of 14  :::
Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected
case -2-
is that the service, which the petitioner has rendered with Fish Farmers
Development Agency (hereinafter referred as 'FFDA') has not been taken into
account as qualifying service for computing pensionary benefits of the
petitioner. The prayer of the petitioner is that the said service, for which
the petitioner has already been granted the benefit of pay protection and the
same has also been taken into consideration for the grant of benefits under
Assured Career Progression Scheme and leave encashment, should be taken into
account as qualifying service for computing pensionary benefits.
FFDAs came into being in the year 1976. Initially, the said agency was
established at Karnal and, thereafter, keeping in view the result being given
by the said agency by the year 1999, FFDAs were created in all the districts
of the State of Haryana. Initially all the employees of the FFDAs were the
employees of Fisheries Department, Haryana, who were sent on deputation there
to discharge the duties. There were 216 posts, which were sanctioned in the
various FFDAs and out of the said 216 posts, 172 posts were held by the
employees of the Fisheries Department, Government of Haryana by way of
deputation. Against remaining 44 posts, recruitment was done by FFDAs and
petitioner was appointed as fisheries extension worker during the said
recruitment. The grant-in-aid was given to the FFDAs by the Government of
Haryana and the salary, which was being paid to the employees of the FFDAs,
who were on deputation or recruited by the FFDAs, was being paid by the State
Government. Initially, the Deputy Commissioner of the concerned district was
the administrator of the FFDA but later, FFDAs were governed/administrated by
the Director Fisheries Department. This was for 2 of 14  ::: Downloaded on -

the reason that most of the employees, who were working in FFDAs were on
deputation from the Fisheries Department, Haryana.
It is a matter of fact that in the year 2004, the Fisheries Department,
Haryana as well as FFDAs were restructured by the Commissioner and Secretary
of Government of Haryana, Department of Fisheries and certain posts existing
in the Fisheries Department as well as in FFDAs were abolished. Further,
keeping in view the order of the Government of Haryana, the FFDAs were merged
with Fisheries Department. The order restructuring the department of Fisheries
and merger of FFDA with fisheries department of Government of Haryana was
passed on 26.05.2004. Consequently, upon the merger of the FFDAs with the
Fisheries Department, the employees who were working in FFDAs, who were
recruited fresh by the said agency, were also absorbed in the fisheries
department of Haryana vide order dated 17.12.2004. After the said absorption,
the petitioner who was working in FFDA was absorbed as fisheries extension
worker in the Fisheries Department of Haryana Government. At the time of
absorption, all the employees were asked to give an affidavit that they will
abide by the terms and conditions of the absorption as and when approved by
the Government and they were to be appointed in the initial pay scale of the
post against which, they were absorbed . Petitioner also gave the said
affidavit, copy of which has been attached by the respondents as Annexure R-3
with the additional affidavit.
While absorbed staff was working in the Fisheries Department, Government of
Haryana vide letter dated 21.4.2008, all the absorbed employees were granted
the benefit of pay protection, which they were drawing in the FFDAs. Though,
initially, at the time of absorption of the 3 of 14  ::: Downloaded on -
19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected case -4-
employees of FFDAs into the Fisheries department of Government of Haryana in
the year 2004, no benefit of the previous service rendered in FFDAs was
granted to them but it is a matter of fact, which is not denied by the learned
counsel for the respondents, that after the said absorption, even the period
of service which the employees had rendered in FFDAs was taken into account
for granting them the benefit of ACP Scheme. The order to this effect passed
by the Government of Haryana on 15.09.2015 has been attached as Annexure R-7
by the respondents with additional affidavit. It is not disputed by the
learned counsel for the respondents that the benefit of leave encashment for
the period spent by the employees in FFDAs has already been extended to them.
The only benefit which has not been extended to the employees who were earlier
working with FFDAs is counting of their service, which they have rendered in
FFDA, as qualifying service for computing pensionary benefits.
It is matter of fact that when the petitioner retired from service on
attaining the age of superannuation on 30.11.2013, he was granted the
pensionary benefits, which benefit was later on withdrawn by the respondents
on the ground that the petitioner did not had ten years service with the
Fisheries department, Government of Haryana and, therefore, petitioner is not
entitled for the pensionary benefits, which order is impugned in the present
writ petition.
In CWP No.11106 of 2015, the benefit of pension was not granted and the prayer
of the petitioners in both the writ petitions is that the service, which they
had rendered in FFDA be treated as qualifying service for computing their
pensionary benefits.
Upon notice of motion, respondents have filed reply. In the 4 of 14  :::
Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected
case -5-
reply, it has been stated that at the time when the merger of FFDAs with the
Fisheries Department was under consideration in June, 2004, a draft was
prepared for the conditions to be laid down for absorption, wherein, as per
condition No.7, it was proposed that no benefit of the service rendered in the
FFDAs will be given while calculating pensionary benefits and, therefore,
keeping in view the said proposal, the benefit of the service rendered by the
petitioners in FFDA cannot be taken into account as qualifying service for
computing the pensionary benefits. In the reply, respondents have admitted
that benefit of pay protection has already been given to the petitioners while
being absorbed in the department of Fisheries. Further, the service rendered
with the FFDA has been taken into account for the grant of benefit under
Assured Career Progression Scheme. It has also been admitted by the
respondents in the reply that even the benefit of leave encashment in respect
of the service rendered by employees in the FFDA has been extended. Relevant
paragraph of the reply is as under:-

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record
with their able assistance.
The only question posed before this Court is whether in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, service, which has been rendered by the
petitioners in FFDAs, can be treated as qualifying service for computing their
pensionary benefits.
First of all, it has to be noticed here that FFDA, where the petitioners were
initially appointed was merged with the Fisheries Department. Once the FFDA
was merged with the Fisheries Department, the benefit of service, which the
petitioners have rendered with the FFDA cannot be ignored while computing the
pensionary benefits. It is not the case where the petitioners became surplus
from a particular department 6 of 14  ::: Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56
::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected case -7-
and they were retrenched and, thereafter, were absorbed in any other
department so as to deny them the benefit of the service rendered in the
previous department. In the present case, it is admitted by the respondents
that FFDAs were merged in the Fisheries Department and merger does not take
away the right of an employee to claim the benefit of service rendered by
him/her prior to the said merger and that too for pensionary benefits.
A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court while deciding CWP No.16541 of 1990 titled
as Lt. Col. Gurdev Singh Sandhu (Retd.) vs. Union of India on 06.03.1992, has
held that where there is merger between the two departments, the incumbents,
who are being absorbed upon merger, are entitled for counting their total
length of service for computing pensionary benefits. Relevant paragraph of the
judgement is as under:-
> "After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, I am of the view that
> there is considerable force in the argument of the learned counsel for the
> petitioner. If an incumbent had no choice, whether to be absorbed in the
> Indian Army or the Territorial Army and he had to obey the orders of the

> then there is no justification not to count the State force service for

> hold that the action of the respondent in not counting the State Force
> service of the petitioner for purposes of pension, arbitrary and
> discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
> India.
Further, a co-ordinate Bench of this Court, has held that where two cadres are
merged, the service rendered in one cadre cannot be taken 7 of 14  :::
Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected
case -8-
away even for the grant of seniority. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court while
deciding CWP No.3476 of 1985 titled as Raj Mal Bhatia vs. Punjab State Civil
Supplies Corporation on 17.05.1991 has held that where two cadres are merged,
the employees are entitled for counting the total length of service rendered
on both the cadres. Relevant paragraph of the judgement is as under:-
> "I am not impressed by the argument of the respondents that according to the
> Regulations of the Corporation, which came into force on 1st April 1979, the
> seniority was to be determined on the basis of length of service on a post

> Therefore, even according to the draft regulations which were being
> followed, the seniority had to be reckoned on the basis of length of service
> in the Corporation.
> The present case is also the case of merger of two departments.
From the facts and circumstance of this case, it is clear that Fisheries
department was administrating authority of FFDAs before merger of FFDAs in
Fisheries department, hence, the service rendered in FFDAs by the petitioners
cannot be ignored for the grant of pensionary benefits. Therefore, the action
of the respondents in declining the benefit of the service rendered in FFDA by
treating it as previous department is incorrect. Once the FFDA's were merged
with the Fisheries Department, 8 of 14  ::: Downloaded on - 19-01-2020
04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected case -9-
the FFDAs are to be treated as Fisheries Department for all intent and
purposes and, therefore, service, which the petitioners had rendered with the
FFDA cannot be ignored for grant of pensionary benefits.
Further the question of grant of benefit of previous service also came up for
consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India while deciding Civil Appeal Nos.5363- 64 of 1997 on 14.12.1999 titled
as S.I. Rooplal vs. Lt. Governor through Chief Secretary, Delhi held that
where an employee has been absorbed in a new department, declining the benefit
of previous service will be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India. Relevant paragraph of the judgment is as under:-
> "It is clear from the ratio laid down in the above case that any Rule,
> Regulation or Executive Instruction which has the effect of taking away the
> service rendered by a deputationist in an equivalent cadre in the parent
> department while counting his seniority in the deputed post would be
> violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Hence, liable to be
> struck down. Since the impugned Memorandum in its entirety does not take

> the rights of the appellants could be preserved, we agree with the prayer of
> the petitioners/ appellants and the offending words in the Memorandum
> "whichever is later" are held to be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the
> Constitution, hence, those words are quashed from the text of the impugned

> Consequently, the right of the petitioners/appellants to count their service
> from the date of their regular appointment in the post of Sub-Inspector in
> BSF, while computing their seniority in the cadre of Sub- Inspector
> (Executive) in the Delhi Police, is restored.
In S.I. Rooplal's case (Supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has granted
seniority on absorption in a new department by counting service rendered in
the previous department. If the benefit of seniority can 9 of 14  :::
Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected
case -10-
be granted on absorption, declining the benefit of the said service while
computing pensionary benefits will be totally discriminatory and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, declining the benefit of
service rendered by the petitioner in FFDA for computing his pensionary
benefits cannot be sustained being contrary to the settled principle of law.
Further, it is clear that even when the FFDA's were working separately, the
same were under the Fisheries Department of Government of Haryana and 75%
employees of the Fisheries Department were working on deputation in FFDAs. The
FFDAs were controlled by the Director, Fisheries Department or the Deputy
Commissioner of the concerned district, as the case may be, at the relevant
time. Once, even while working in the FFDA, the controlling authority of the
petitioners was Fisheries Department and they were being paid salary by the
Government of Haryana, declining of the benefits of counting the service
rendered in FFDAs as qualifying service, is totally without any rationale.
Petitioners continued working without any interruption from the date they were
appointed in the FFDAs till their retirement therefore, the benefit of service
rendered by them in FFDAs cannot be ignored for computing pensionary benefits.
Even otherwise, keeping in view the facts recorded above, it is clear that
service, which the petitioners had rendered in the FFDAs, has been taken into
account for pay protection after being merged in the Fisheries Department .
Once the benefit of the said service has been given for pay protection, there
is no rationale as to why the said service cannot be taken into account as
qualifying service for computing pensionary 10 of 14  ::: Downloaded on -
19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected case -11-
benefits. Further, it has been admitted by the respondents themselves that the
service rendered by the petitioners in the FFDA has been taken into account
while granting benefit of Assured Career Progression Scheme. So, once the
benefit of service rendered in FFDA is to be taken into account for grant of
higher pay scale, the same cannot be declined for taking into account as
qualifying service for the grant of pension.
Further, even while computing benefit of leave encashment, which is a retiral
benefit, the service which the petitioner had rendered in FFDA has been taken
into account. Leave encashment is a retiral benefit and when for a particular
retiral benefit, service rendered by the petitioner in FFDAs has been taken
into account, there is no rationale to decline the benefit of the said service
for another retiral benefit such a gratuity and pension.
Learned counsel for the respondents has not been able to point out any valid
justification for declining the petitioners, the benefit of service rendered
by them in FFDA. The only reason given by the State counsel is that as before
the merger, there was proposal to decline the benefit of service rendered in
FFDAs towards the pension, hence, the said benefit has not been extended to
the petitioners. Nothing has been placed on record that the said proposal was
ever brought into force at the time of actual merger, which was carried out in
December 2004. The proposal was made in June, 2004 but there is nothing on
record that it was accepted by the competent authority at the time when the
actual merger of FFDAs with the Fisheries Department was undertaken. A bare
perusal of order dated 26.05.2004 (Annexure P/13), which is an actual order of
merger, does not have any such restriction. Further, in the affidavit which
was taken from 11 of 14  ::: Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646
of 2014 (O&M) and connected case -12-
the petitioners, before they were merged with fisheries department of Haryana,
it has been mentioned that they will abide by any terms and conditions, which
were yet to be approved by the Government in respect of the merger. No
approval of the Government for the proposed condition of denying the benefit
of service rendered by the petitioners in FFDA for the grant of pension has
been placed before this Court. Therefore, it cannot be said that there was any
condition approved by the competent authority at the time of merger that
petitioners will not be granted the benefit of service rendered in FFDA for
the grant of pension.
Even if, it is assumed for the sake of arguments that proposal which was made
in May, 2004 for declining the benefit of service rendered by the employee in
FFDA is to be treated as qualifying service still, the same has to be on valid
justification and rationale. Keeping in view the subsequent development which
has come into being, once after merger, which was effected in December, 2004,
the petitioners have been granted the benefit of service rendered in FFDAs
towards pay protection, leave encashment, grant of benefit of ACP scheme and
grant of higher pay scale, there is no valid justification for declining the
benefit of same service towards the grant of pensionary benefits.
Therefore, in view the facts and circumstance which have been detailed above,
no justifiable reason has been given by the respondent- State to deny the
petitioners, the benefit of service which they had rendered in the FFDA to be
treated as qualifying service for computing pensionary benefits.
No other argument has been raised by the learned counsel for the respondents.
12 of 14  ::: Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M)
and connected case -13-
In view of the above, the claim of the petitioners is allowed. Service
rendered by the petitioners in FFDA, which was controlled by the Fisheries
Department, Haryana and for which the petitioners were being paid salary by
the Government of Haryana cannot be declined to be treated as qualifying
service for computing pensionary benefits.
Let pensionary benefits after the retirement of the petitioners be
recalculated and for whatever benefits, the petitioners are entitled under
this order be released to them within a period of three months from the date
of receipt of certified copy of this order.
At this stage, learned counsel for the respondents states that while the
petitioners were working in FFDA, there was no contribution deposited by the
petitioners toward contributory fund. Learned counsel for the respondents
relies upon memorandum issued by the department on 07.01.2002, which deals
with the situation, where the person has been appointed from non-pensionable
to pensionable post. Relevant portion of the said instructions is as under:-
> "On appointment from non-pensionable to pensionable organisation:
> If pension scheme is not in existence in the previous Organisation but the
> same is in existence in the new organisation, in such case on
> appointment/absorption of an employee of State Autonomous Body in any
> Department under Haryana Government, he will have the option to get benefit
> of qualifying service rendered in the previous organisation for the purpose
> of pension in new organisation by foregoing employer's share of CPF with
> interest received from the old organisation which will be paid to new
> Organisation. This option will be exercised within six months from the date
> of appointment on regular basis in the new Organisation. If no option is
> exercised within the stipulated period, the employee shall be deemed to have
> opted to receive and retain CPF benefits. Option once exercised shall be
> final."
A bare perusal of the above would show that where a person who has been
appointed from non-pensionable post to pensionable post, 13 of 14  :::
Downloaded on - 19-01-2020 04:47:56 ::: CWP-25646 of 2014 (O&M) and connected
case -14-
he/she has to deposit the employee's share of GPF with interest.
Learned counsel for the petitioners prays that petitioners are ready to
deposit their contribution towards GPF in respect of service which they had
rendered with FFDA along with interest and their contribution be deducted from
the arrears of the pensionary benefits, which petitioners become entitled for
under this order.
Learned counsel for the respondents raises no objection to the said prayer and
submits that the petitioner's contribution will be deducted alongwith interest
by the respondents from the arrears of the recalculated pensionary benefits,
for which the petitioners will be found entitled under this order and rest of
the amount will be released in their favour within a period of two months from
the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
Both the writ petitions stand allowed in above terms.
