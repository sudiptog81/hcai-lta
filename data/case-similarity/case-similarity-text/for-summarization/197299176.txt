                 ::  VERSUS ::
         1.  Shyam Pukhraj Asopa,
              Aged about 44 years,
only the aggrieved party may approach the Civil Court if there was violation
of fundamental judicial procedure or if process of law was abused by the
statutory forum/Tribunal or that it acted in violation of the provisions of
the Statute. This being the position, if, in view of averment in the plaint,
the plaintiffs have statutory remedy, the plaintiffs must first approach the
statutory forum for an order of injunctive reliefs available under the Statute
against the respondents including the Bank concerned.
Scheme and Object/purport of the SARFAESI Act leads us to the above
conclusion. Hence, no interference is required in the impugned judgments and
orders in the facts and circumstances of the case. The substantial question is
answered accordingly.

             JUDGMENT.
             1. 
This appeal is filed by the appellants/original plaintiffs against Judgment
and Order, dated 2.2.2013 passed by the learned District Judge-1, Amravati in
Regular Civil Appeal No.135 of 2006 whereby the appeal was dismissed. The said
appeal arose from the Judgment and Order passed by the learned 6th Joint Civil
Judge (Jr.Dn.), Amravati in Regular Civil Suit No.404 of 2005, whereby the
suit was dismissed for want of jurisdiction in view of the finding below
preliminary issue under Section 9-A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
2\. The facts, briefly stated, are thus :-
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
3 sa159.13.odt Appellant No.1 is wife of one Bhagwantrao Patil, who had
purchased an open plot No.32 in the field bearing Survey No.31/1A, plot
admeasuring 1150 square feet of mouza Tarkheda, Taluka and District Amravati.
He had constructed a house bearing Municipal House No.320 in Ward No.1 on the
said plot. Bhagwantrao Patil had abandoned appellant No.1/plaintiff No.1 since
July 1995; since then he is not heard as alive. Appellant No.1 was left
without any source of income.
Defendant No.1, as a friend of her husband, had assisted plaintiff
No.1/Savita. In December 1997, defendant No.1 sought help from plaintiff
No.1/Savita to purchase a Truck/Vehicle by asking her to execute the nominal
Sale deed in his favour so that he can obtain a loan from the Bank. The
plaintiffs averred that the Sale Deed was nominal and void. The Bank
(respondent no.2) has already initiated proceedings for realisation of loan.
On 6.8.2003, notice of attachment was issued on the suit property (vide
Exh.28) issued under Section 13 (2) the Securitization and Reconstruction of
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter
referred to as "the SARFAESI Act").
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
4 sa159.13.odt
3\. The suit was filed. The prayer in the suit was; (i) for relief of
declaration that the Sale Deed, dated 19.12.1997 executed by the plaintiff in
favour of defendant no. 1 is void and, (ii) to restrain the defendants from
dispossessing the plaintiffs on the basis of the said Sale Deed. Later relief
(ii) was in effect to restrain the Bank from realising it's non-performing
assets under the SARFAESI Act. On 12.1.2006, a preliminary issue was raised
before the trial Court objecting jurisdiction of the Court to entertain and
try the suit.
4\. The trial Court framed the preliminary issue and heard the parties. The
trial Court refused to entertain the suit for seeking the relief (ii) of
injunction for want of jurisdiction but directed the parties to proceed
further in view of prayer clause (i) regarding declaration sought. As the Bank
has already initiated proceedings under the SARFAESI Act, the Civil Court
refused to entertain prayer for injunction by well-reasoned order.

5 sa159.13.odt
5\. The first Appellate Court in Regular Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, decided
on 2.2.2013 affirmed the order passed by the trial Court.
6\. The second appeal is admitted on the substantial question of law stated as
under :-
> Whether the Courts below were right in holding that the suit claiming the
> consequential relief of injunction restraining the respondents/defendants
> from dispossessing the appellants / plaintiffs from the suit property is
> barred by the provisions of the Section 34 of the Securitization and
> Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security interest Act,
> 2002?
7\. On behalf of the appellants, it is submitted that the Civil Court could
not have bifurcated the prayers so as to hold the suit maintainable for the
relief of declaration to determine validity of the Sale Deed and to hold that
the prayer for grant of injunction to restrain the defendants by an injunction
order was not maintainable for want of jurisdiction.
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
6 sa159.13.odt
8\. On behalf of the respondents, it is urged that, by the concurrent
findings, the Courts below held that, in view of appeal provided for under
Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, the plaintiffs have statutory remedy to pray
for injunction before the special forum under the Act. Section 34 of the Act
bars the Civil Court from granting relief of injunction in respect of the
cases required to be heard under the Act.
9\.
Let us now consider the Legal position :
The object of SARFAESI Act is very good aiming at reducing 'Non-performing
Asset", the constitutional Courts had to interpret the provisions of the Act
dealing with many complicated issues and keeping in view the interest of the
borrowers. Many issues under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act are settled
now. The two most important cases in that process are Mardia Chemicals Ltd vs.
Union of India, (2004)4 SCC 311 and Transcore v. Union of India reported in
AIR 2007 SC 712 wherein the Supreme Court has settled the legal position
substantially with regard to the SARFAESI Act and  ::: Downloaded on -
26/04/2014 23:39:00 ::: 7 sa159.13.odt made the rigor of SARFAESI Act for the
recovery of NPAs effective in letter and spirit. When the Statute creating
rights and obligations constituted the forum to enforce them, such special
forums ordinarily are considered right over and above the general law. Section
9 of the Code of Civil Procedure makes the intention of the Legislature clear.
Civil court does have plenary jurisdiction to try all civil suits, unless
barred expressly or by necessary implication. The maxim "Ubi jus ibi remedium"
i.e. wherever there is right there is remedy denotes plenary jurisdiction of
the Civil Court to decide about its own jurisdiction on the basis of the
averments in the plaint. Ouster of the jurisdiction is not to be readily
inferred. But, at the same time, jurisdiction cannot be conferred where there
is none.
Neither parties can confer jurisdiction by consent because if the court
decides without jurisdiction, the decree would be nullity ab initio. When the
special Statute has provided the adequate or sufficient alternative
efficacious remedy, jurisdiction of the Civil Court is excluded expressly or
by necessary implication.
Section 34 of the SURFAESI Act mentions expressly that the Civil Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the Civil Suit in  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014
23:39:00 ::: 8 sa159.13.odt relation to the matter required to be determined
by the Debt recovery Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal. The Civil Court
cannot grant injunction against an action under the SURFAESI Act or its Rules.
Section 35 mentions the non-obstante clause which has overriding effect. The
crux of the question is as to which of the rights or obligations are sought to
be enforced. If remedy is available to get the right or obligation adjudicated
under the special Act, the suit would not be entertained by the Civil Court as
it would not lie in the Civil Court. Plenary jurisdiction of the Civil Court
under general law could be resorted to when the statutory
Authorities/Forum/Tribunal have acted without jurisdiction or when fundamental
principles of the judicial procedure was not complied with.
10\. A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Firm of
Illury Subbayya Chetty and Sons ..vs..
State of Andhra Pradesh, reported at AIR 1964 SC 322, placing reliance upon
the judgments in the cases of the Privy Council Secretary of State ..vs.. Mask
and Co., reported at AIR 1940 Privy Council 105 and Raleigh Investment Co.
Ltd. ..vs.. The  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 ::: 9 sa159.13.odt
Governor General in Council, reported AIR 1947 PC 78, held as under :
> "...................there is a general presumption that there must be a
> remedy in the ordinary civil court to a citizen claiming that an amount had
> been recovered from him illegally and that such a remedy can be held to be
> barred only on very clear and unmistakable indication to the contrary. The
> exclusion of the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain civil cause will
> not be assumed unless the relevant Statute contains an express provision to
> that effect or leads to a necessary and inevitable implication of that
> nature.............."
11\. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ram
Swarup and Ors. v. Shikar Chand and Another., reported at AIR 1966 SC 893,
held that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts to deal with civil causes can
be excluded by the Legislature by Special Act which may deal with special
subject-matters, but the statutory provision must expressly provide for such
exclusion or must necessarily and impliedly lead to that inference. However,
the said bar would not be relevant if the plea raised before the Civil Court
goes to the root of the matter and would, if upheld, lead to the conclusion
that the impugned order is a nullity.

12\. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Dhulabhai and Anr. ..vs.. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr., reported at AIR
1969 SC 78, held that exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Court by express
provision may not be a complete bar to entertain a suit if party satisfies the
Civil Court that the Statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the
fundamental principles of judicial procedure. More so, the Statutory Tribunal
must be competent to provide all the remedies normally associated with the
actions' in Civil Courts, which are either prescribed by the said Statute or
not. More so, the exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily
to be inferred unless the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled. In the case of
Dhulabhai and Anr. (cited supra), Hidayatullah, C.J., speaking for the Court
on an analysis of the various decisions cited before the Court expressing
diverse views, laid down as many as seven principles regarding exclusion of
jurisdiction of Civil Court, out of which at least two principles being
germane to the controversy involved in this petition are excerpted below :
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
11 sa159.13.odt "(a) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the
special Tribunal the civil court's Jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if
there is adequate remedy to do what the civil courts would normally do in a
suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the
provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory
Tribunal has not acted In conformity with the fundamental principles of
judicial procedure.
(b) Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the Court, an
examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the
sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to
sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court."
13\. In the case of Sardara Singh (dead) by LRs and another ..vs.. Sardara
Singh (dead) and others reported at (1990) 4 SCC 90, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has held that Civil Court's jurisdiction is available wherever action is taken
without jurisdiction under any Statute.
14\. In the case of D.R.Chawla and others ..vs.. Municipal Corporation of
Delhi reported at (1993) 3 SCC 162, the  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014
23:39:00 ::: 12 sa159.13.odt Supreme Court has held that where statutory
enactments only create rights or liabilities without providing forums for
remedies, any person having a grievance that he had been wronged or his right
is being affected, can approach the ordinary Civil Court, but in case a
Special Forum is provided for enforcement of such right or for protection or
enforcement of a liability without any authority in law, the ouster of the
Civil Court's jurisdiction can be upheld on the finding that the rights and
liabilities in question have been created by the Act without touching the
existing Common Law rights and the remedy provided therein is adequate and
complete. But where adequate redressal machinery is not provided under the
Statutory Forum, the Civil Court can still examine the correctness of the
order passed under the Statute.
15\. In the case of Pavitter Singh and others ..vs..
Niranjan Lal Malhotra reported at JT 2001(8) SC 641, the Apex Court has held
that Section 46 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 bars the
jurisdiction of Civil Court in certain cases. The Court has held that, in such
an eventuality, the Civil  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 ::: 13
sa159.13.odt Court cannot entertain and try a suit as its jurisdiction has
expressly been barred and the only remedy in such cases, if any person is
aggrieved by the order passed under the Act in respect of those evicted, is to
resort to writ jurisdiction of the Writ Court.
16\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while dealing with the provisions of The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939, in the cases of Shri Chand ..vs.. Government of U.P. and
Ors. reported in AIR 1986 SC 242, and Anwar ..vs.. First Addl. District Judge,
Bulandshahr and Ors., reported in AIR 1986 SC 1785, has observed that, in most
of the matters pertaining to the Motor Vehicles Act, the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court is impliedly barred as the matter can be adjudicated upon by the
State Transport Appellate Tribunal only.
17\. In the case of Sankaranarayanan Potti (dead) by LRs ..vs.. K. Sreedevi
and Ors., reported at (1998) 3 SCC 751, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed
as under :
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
14 sa159.13.odt "It is obvious that in all types of civil disputes, civil
courts have inherent jurisdiction as per Section 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure unless a part of that jurisdiction is carved out from such
jurisdiction, expressly or by necessary implication, by any statutory
provision and conferred on any other Tribunal or authority."
18\. Similar view has been reiterated in the case of Shri Panch Nagar Parakh,
Mandsaur ..vs.. Purushottam Das, reported in AIR 1999 SC 3071.
19\. In the case of P. A. Ahammed Ibrahim ..vs.. Food Corporation of India
reported in AIR 1999 SC 3033, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the
applications under the provisions of various Statutes cannot be treated as
suits or claims unless such possibility is specifically provided for under
those particular statutes.
20\. In the case of Bhanu Construction Co.(P.) Ltd. ..vs..
Andhra Bank, Hyderabad reported at AIR 2001 SC 477, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has considered the provisions of  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 :::
15 sa159.13.odt Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act,
1993 and held that, after commencement of the provisions of the said Act ever
since it came into force, the suit could not be instituted as conferring the
jurisdiction upon the Tribunal under the Act would take away the jurisdiction
of the Civil Court.
21\. In the case of Vannattankandy Ibrayi ..vs..
Kunhabdulla Hajee reported in (2001) 1 SCC 564, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
considered the provisions of the Kerala Building and Lease Control Act, 1965,
which barred the jurisdiction of the Civil Court for recovery of premises on
various grounds by the landlord before the Authority prescribed under the Act
and that the suit was not maintainable. The Court held that where the building
stood washed off because of natural calamity; possession of the remaining land
may be recovered before the Civil Court. The Court held that under such
circumstances, the Civil Court may have jurisdiction, but had the building
been there, its jurisdiction was barred by Section 9 of the Code because it
ceased to be a building and  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 ::: 16
sa159.13.odt remained land and in such a situation, only the Civil Court was
competent to entertain and try the suit.
22\. In the case of Shri Ram and Anr. ..vs.. First Addl.
District Judge and Ors. reported in AIR 2001 SC 1250, the Apex Court has held
that, in tenancy matters, generally revenue Court has the jurisdiction, but in
case a suit is filed for cancellation of a void document, Section 9 of the
Code does not impliedly bar such a suit because the document has been obtained
by fraud or impersonation, as in such a case mere declaration of title is
required and the document, being void, is merely to be ignored for giving
relief for declaration and possession.
23\. In the case of Ghulam Qadir ..vs.. Special Tribunal and others. reported
in (2002) 1 SCC 33, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that - in case the
title is to be established, the remedy of Civil Court is available and in such
case, Section 9 of the Code would not bar the Civil Suit and would ask the
::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00 ::: 17 sa159.13.odt Authority only to
avail the remedy under the provisions of J & K State Evacuees (Administration
of Property) Act, 1949.
24\. In the case of M/s. Pearlite Liners Pvt. Ltd. ..vs..
Manorma Sirsi reported in 2004 (1) AWC 764 (SC), the Apex Court has held that,
as contract of service (Private) cannot be enforced in Court, the suit for
declaration/permanent injunction that termination was bad, would not be
entertained.
25\. A party is bound either by provisions of the Constitution, statutory
provisions or any rule or under the terms of the contract which is not against
the public policy. In case, parties under their own agreement expressly agree
that their dispute shall be tried by only one of several forums available to
them, then the party can only file the suit in that Court alone to which they
had agreed vide Shriram City Union Finance Corporation Ltd. ..vs.. Rama Mishra
reported in AIR 2002 SC 2402\.
26\. In the case of Abdul Waheed Khan ..vs.. v. Bhawani and Ors. reported in
AIR 1966 SC 1718, the Apex Court has  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014 23:39:00
::: 18 sa159.13.odt held that a statute ousting the jurisdiction of a Civil
Court must be strictly construed. In fact, it is the pith and substance of the
plaint which is to be seen to determine : whether the suit is maintainable in
a Civil Court or before other competent Authority, as the language might be
used in such a way that it may oust the jurisdiction of a particular Court.
The form of action in relation to void document or instrument regarding
agricultural land depends on the real cause of action with reference to the
facts averred.
27\. In the case of Smt. Bismillah ..vs.. Janeshwar Prasad and Ors. reported
in AIR 1990 SC 540, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
> "It is true that the question of jurisdiction depends upon the allegations

> order to determine the premise, the nature of action, the pleadings should

29\. In the case of Ramaswamy (dead) by LRs ..vs.. M.
Lobo (dead) by LRs., reported in (2001) 10 SCC 176, the Hon'ble Apex Court
rejected the contention that a suit in respect of the agricultural land could
be entertained only by the Revenue Court and not by the Writ Court on the
ground that the use of the land stood changed as it was having the residential
buildings.

has held that suit by a recorded tenure holder in possession for cancellation
of a sale deed being void would be before the Civil Court.
31\. A seven Judges' Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kamla
Mills Limited ..vs.. State of Bombay, reported in AIR 1965 SC 1942 has
considered the issue - under what circumstances a suit of civil nature can be
held to be barred by special statute. The Court has held that, for deciding
the issue, the Court is to be very conscious about the words used in the
statutory provisions on which the plea is rested, the scheme of the relevant
provision, their object and purpose. The issue becomes more important when the
bar is pleaded by necessary implication and it becomes pertinent to inquire as
to whether remedy is normally associated with actions in Civil Courts are
prescribed by the said institute or not.

Supreme Court has held that - for ousting the jurisdiction of the Civil Court,
the other statute should provide for an adequate and satisfactory alternative
remedy to a party that may be aggrieved by the relevant order under its
material provision.
33\. In the case of Sahebgouda (Dead) by L.Rs. and Ors. ..vs.. Ogeppa and Ors.
reported in AIR 2003 SC 2743, the Apex Court has held that - to prove that the
Civil Court does not have jurisdiction, a very heavy onus lies on the party
seeking ouster of Civil Court Jurisdiction as exclusion of jurisdiction is not
to be easily inferred.
34\. In the case of Dwarka Prasad Agrawal ..vs.. Ramesh Chandra Agrawal and
Ors. reported in 2003 (3) SCCD 1210 :
AIR 2003 SC 2696, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered a case as to
whether the jurisdiction of the Civil Court stood barred by the Companies Act.
In that case, the owner of the Printing Press leased out the premises to a
company, of which he himself had been one of the members. Another member of
the Company wanted to disposses the lessor of the Printing  ::: Downloaded on

eviction suit filed by the lessor against the said other member of the Company
was held to be maintainable in view of the provisions of Section 6 of the
Specific Relief Act, 1963 in spite of the fact that the provisions of Sections
9 and 10 of the Companies Act, 1956 barred the jurisdiction of the Civil
Court. The Court held that, in such an eventuality, the statutory provisions
ousting the jurisdiction of a Civil Court requires very strict interpretation.
35\. In the case of Chhedi Lal Gupta and Ors. ..vs..
Mohammad Sattar reported in AIR 1963 SC 448 - a suit under Section 73 of the
Trade Marks Act had been filed in the Civil Court and the objection had been
filed regarding jurisdiction, which was dismissed by the Civil Court. However,
in Writ Petition, the High Court issued the writ of prohibition to the learned
Civil Court not to proceed with the trial of the suit and issued further
direction to return the plaint under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure to enable the plaintiff to file the same in a Court/Authority of
having the jurisdiction in the matter.

36\. In the case of Auto Engineering Works ..vs.. Bansal Trading Company and
Ors. reported in (2001) 10 SCC 630, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that
once the Civil Court comes to the conclusion after having heard on the issue
of jurisdiction that it does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the suit,
the Court must return the plaint to present the same before the Court of
competent jurisdiction.
37\. In the case of S. Govinda Menon ..vs.. Union of India and Ors. reported
in AIR 1967 SC 1274, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that there is no
prohibition for the Writ Court to issue the writ of prohibition to the
inferior Court if it assumes a jurisdiction which it does not possess or this
is to prevent it from exceeding the limits of its jurisdiction, the purpose of
issuing such a writ is to keep the inferior Court/Tribunal within their bounds
of limited jurisdiction. Writ may also be issued in case of departure from the
principles of natural justice.

40\. The principle that emerges from the in-depth discussion is that, if
remedy is made available statutorily, it  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2014
23:39:00 ::: 27 sa159.13.odt must be exhausted first before the Civil Court of
ordinary jurisdiction can be approached upon afore-emphasized grounds.
Conclusion is that when the remedy is specifically made available and specific
remedy of injunction is carved out of the ordinary jurisdiction of the Civil
Court under the special statute, such statutory remedy has to be exhausted
first by the parties in accordance with special statutory provisions and then
only the aggrieved party may approach the Civil Court if there was violation
of fundamental judicial procedure or if process of law was abused by the
statutory forum/Tribunal or that it acted in violation of the provisions of
the Statute. This being the position, if, in view of averment in the plaint,
the plaintiffs have statutory remedy, the plaintiffs must first approach the
statutory forum for an order of injunctive reliefs available under the Statute
against the respondents including the Bank concerned.
Scheme and Object/purport of the SARFAESI Act leads us to the above
conclusion. Hence, no interference is required in the impugned judgments and
orders in the facts and circumstances of the case. The substantial question is
answered accordingly.
