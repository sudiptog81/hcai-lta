K.ARYA, MEMBER (TECHNICAL) Date of Hearing:-14.12.2016 Date of
Pronouncement:16.12.2016 ORDER NO.FO/A/76311/16 Per Shri Ashok K.Arya,
1\. The present appeal is filed against the Order-in-Original NO.
11\. In the instant case, the department raised no demand of service tax on
the fee shared by the appellant with the learning centers. Only the dispute is
pertaining to accreditation fee while in the case of PTU, entire fee
structure was the subject matter of the tax.
12\. Moreover, the Punjab Technical University case has come after 2013, when
the distance education was brought under regulation of the University Grants
Commission. But during the period under consideration, the distance education
was regulated by the Distance Education Council (DEC), IGNOU, Delhi which is
an independent and distinguishable legal entity. The entire fee structure was
brought to the net of service tax in the above case law (PTU) but it is not
the Revenues case in the present case. When it is so then there is no
justification to bring the accreditation fee to the service tax net. Hence,
we set aside the impugned order.
In the result the appeal is allowed with consequential relief.
                   (Pronounced in the open court on 16.12.2016)
    	   S/d.                                                         S/d.		
1\. The present appeal is filed against the Order-in-Original NO.
11/COM/ST/SLG/12-13 dated 4.10.2012 passed by the Commissioner of Customs,
Excise & Service Tax, Siliguri.
2\. The brief facts of the case are that the appellant assessee is a statutory
university located in Sikkim. The appellant is providing distance education
with the approval by Distance Education Council (DEC), Indira Gandhi National
Open University throughout India till 2013. After 2013, with the approval of
University Grants Commission (UGC), the appellant is providing the distance
education services throughout India and abroad.
3\. During the period under consideration, the appellant has established,
maintained learning centers (LCs)/Study Centres (SCs) for distance education
in different parts of the country. For the said purpose they entered into an
agreement with the private parties. Accordingly, they share the fees and also
charge the accreditation/registration fee from each learning/study centre. The
Department opined that only the accreditation fee is subject to service tax so
they demanded the service tax. Being aggrieved the appellant assessee has
filed the present appeal.
4\. With this background Ms. Leena Rachh, CA, on behalf of the appellant,
submits that as per the agreement between the learning centre and the
appellant, no fee can be charged by the learning/study center. No student can
be admitted by the learning center. It is only the appellant, who admits and
charges fees in its own name through the banking channel and provide the
guidelines for establishing learning and study centres, who are to have and
provide qualified teachers and infrastructure. Recognition of the learning
centre can be withdrawn at any time by the appellant. Every fee is charged by
the appellant i.e. the appellant institution.
5\. During the course of arguments Ld. CA/Counsel has drawn the attention to
the Order-in-Original No.47-63/Pr.Commr/ST-I/KOL/2016-17, dated 22.08.2016,
passed by the Revenue Department where the issue was discussed. In the said
order dated 22.08.2016, it is mentioned that the appellant is empowered and is
required, for the purpose of its Distance Education Mode, itself to establish
and collaborate with study centers/learning centers in various parts of the
country and abroad and is required to fulfill the requisite qualifications and
comply with the Distance-Guidelines for regulating Establishment and
Operation of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) Institutions in India 2006
issued by the Distance Education Council, IGNOU, New Delhi. It is also
observed in the said order that Sikkim Manipal University (appellant) was set
up to provide distance learning education which necessarily and inextricably
involved outsourcing pertaining to the teaching and imparting of education;
hence, degrees awarded by the Sikkim Manipal University through Distance
Learning Centers are equivalent to degrees given through campus education.
Thus a candidate will get the degree from Sikkim Manipal University. In the
said order, it is also observed that Learning Centre was therefore providing
all assistance to the University to help the University deliver its graduate
and post graduate programs under the distance education mode.
6\. It is the submission of the Ld. Counsel for the appellant that learning
centers/study centers are not the franchisee of the appellant as wrongly
observed in the impugned order. She has submitted that the relationship
between the appellant and the study centers is established through the
memorandum of agreement. No study center independently can take fees for
admission on its own. In other words, it is the appellant, who charges the
fees and admits the students and shares some parts of the fees with LC/RC but
the said fee has not been brought into the clutches of the service tax by the
authorities concerned. She submits that when the fee charged and shared is
not subject to service tax, then merely accreditation fee amount cannot be
charged to service tax.
7\. On the other hand Shri S.S.Chattopadhyay, Suptd.(AR) has relied on the
order of the lower authorities. He also submits that the issue is covered
against the assassee as per the ratio laid down in the case of Punjab
Technical University vs. Commissioner of Central Excise and Service Tax,
Ludhiana [2016(42)S.T.R. 474 (Tri.-Del.)], where identical facts were
discussed. In the said order, it was stated that students do not identify
themselves with LCs but with appellant university only.
8\. In the rejoinder, the Ld. Counsel for the appellant tried to distinguish
the said case by stating that in the Punjab Technical University (PTU) case,
there was joint venture agreement and not franchise agreement. The learning
centers were at par with the affiliated colleges of the appellant, therefore,
cannot be discriminated vis-`-vis affiliated colleges. In the PTU case, the
university runs its own distance education programme through affiliated
colleges and learning centers. She also submits that PTU regulates its own
distance education as a part of continuing education programme through the
learning centers. The Regional Centers (RCs) will have to issue the State
level advertisements for admission notices for the courses in the leading news
papers in coordination with the university. Regional Centers (RCs) will
arrange to provide training for the latest technologies and teaching pedagogy
to the staff of the LCs in coordination with the University.
9\. But in the case of appellant, the learning/study centers are not
authorized to make any advertisement in the news papers for admitting the
students. The learning centers were not authorized to take students. Even
infrastructure, faculty is to be regulated by the appellant. In the case of
the appellant, the quality control will have to be provided by the appellant,
so the case law cited by Revenue is not applicable to the instant case and is
distinguished on facts and law.
10\. By considering the rival submissions and the materials available on
record, it appears that the case law cited by the Ld. AR, for the revenue i.e.
Punjab Technical University vs. Commissioner of Central Excise and Service
Tax, Ludhiana [2016(42)S.T.R. 474 (Tri.-Del.)] is not applicable and
distinguishable on facts.
11\. In the instant case, the department raised no demand of service tax on
the fee shared by the appellant with the learning centers. Only the dispute is
pertaining to accreditation fee while in the case of PTU, entire fee
structure was the subject matter of the tax.
12\. Moreover, the Punjab Technical University case has come after 2013, when
the distance education was brought under regulation of the University Grants
Commission. But during the period under consideration, the distance education
was regulated by the Distance Education Council (DEC), IGNOU, Delhi which is
an independent and distinguishable legal entity. The entire fee structure was
brought to the net of service tax in the above case law (PTU) but it is not
the Revenues case in the present case. When it is so then there is no
justification to bring the accreditation fee to the service tax net. Hence,
we set aside the impugned order.
In the result the appeal is allowed with consequential relief.
