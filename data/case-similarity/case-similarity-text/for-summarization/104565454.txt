1\. Petitioner seeks appointment of an arbitrator to resolve the disputes
between the petitioner and the respondent in following background:
Resarch". Thus, even the respondent understood the notice of the petitioner
dated 07.04.2015 as one for appointment  Page 7 of 8 HC-NIC Page 7 of 8
Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST 2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER of an arbitrator
in terms of Clause 15 of the agreement.
10\. Though I do not accept the interpretation of the respondent of the said
Clause 15 of the agreement even if such an interpretation is accepted, it can
easily be seen that there is undisputedly an arbitration agreement which would
be, according to the respondent, resorted to once the attempt to resolve the
disputes by the impartial experienced individual fails. In the present case,
when the parties failed to even agree on who such impartial experienced
individual would be, the first requirement of the arbitration clause must be
seen to have been satisfied. It is not as if only when such individual renders
his judgement that the parties can resort to arbitration. Such interpretation
would be too literal, too rigid and plainly not emerging from the reasonable
and conjoint reading of the arbitration clause.
11\. Being a technical matter, let the parties deliberate on the person who
between the petitioner and the respondent in following background:
2\. Petitioner, an institution for Plasma Research, is an autonomous
institution under the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.
Respondent is registered under the Companies Act and is in the business of
surface coatings and manufactures and supplies film coating system to
industries. The petitioner and the respondent entered into an agreement dated
10.08.2005 which was titled as "Technical Knowhow and License Agreement".
Under such agreement, the petitioner Plasma Research Institution would provide
certain technology  Page 1 of 8 HC-NIC Page 1 of 8 Created On Wed Feb 03
01:22:07 IST 2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER and the knowhow to the respondent on
agreed terms, which included payment of royalty. The agreement contained an
arbitration clause in following terms:
"Article 15: Arbitration 15.1 In the event of a dispute arising between FCIPT
& Milman as the first action towards resolution of such dispute, all pertinent
facts will be placed before an impartial erudite and experienced individual
chosen by both parties for arbitration. It the judgement of this individual
does not satisfy one or both parties the dispute, will be finally settled
under the provisions of arbitration and reconciliation act 1996, or its
reenactment, amendment as the case maybe. However, the jurisdiction in any
case shall be Ahmedabad."
3\. In working out of such contractual terms, disputes arose between the
parties. According to the petitioner, the respondent did not submit full
accounts and even after termination of the agreement, continued using the
knowhow which was, according to the petitioner, opposed to the terms of the
contract. On 12.08.2014, the advocates of the petitioner served a legal notice
to the respondent, in which, it was stated as under :
"In the light of the above, in the first instances, it may be noted that the
duration of the agreement is over and you have been unauthorizedly using the
technology of our client which tantamounts to infringement on your part. The
duration of the agreement having come to an end, it is now not open to you to
use the technology of our client.
By this notice, in the first instance, we call upon you to desist from using
our client's technologyor its variants plasma ion  Page 2 of 8 HC-NIC Page 2

nitriding,plasma carbonitriding/nitrocarburising/oxynitriding, etc.
Derivatives of FCIPT Plasma Nitriding Technology cannot be used in any form.
As per the information from our client, you have also been using HV Isolated
Temperature card [developed by FCIPT]. You should stop using such derivatives
forthwith for Plasma Nitriding or any other system.
We also call upon to provide to our client the duly audited accounts and Sales
Record/reportsfrom the date of contract till today as per the requirement of
the above contract, within 21 days from the receipt of this notice. You are
also strongly advised to remove the advertisement and stop canvassing in any
form related to the said technology from your website etc. Upon failure on
your part to comply with the above referred demands, our client will be
constrained to initiate appropriate legal proceedings as may be advised
without any other or further correspondence in this behalf."
4\. The respondent replied to such notice under communication dated 09.01.2015
disputing the allegations made against the respondent.
5\. After further communication between the parties, on 07.04.2015, the
petitioner served a notice to the respondent invoking arbitration clause as
under:
"A conjoint reading of the various correspondences exchanged between you and
our client as also the above referred correspondence reveals that there is a
dispute between your and our client. Your attention is drawn to Article 15 of
the agreement, which requires disputes to be resolved through the process
enumerated therein. As per the requirement of Article  Page 3 of 8 HC-NIC Page
3 of 8 Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST 2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER 15.1 in
the event of such a dispute having arien, the first action towards resolving
all such dispute, all pertinent facts are required to be placed before an
impartial erudite and experienced individual chosen by both parties for
arbitration. We therefore on behalf of our client call upon you to agree to
appointment of Prof. Shri Abhijit Sen (IPR-S.Chandrasekhar Chair) being an
impartial experienced person to resolve the dispute as per Clause 15.1.
You are advised to give your consent within 21 days from the receipt of this
letter, failing which our client would be constrained to initiate appropriate
proceedings under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
without any further notice."
6\. The respondent replied to such notice under communication dated 30.05.2015
and conveyed as under:
"5] Referring to Paragraph No. 2 of your notice which yet persists the
existence of dispute, my Client is however willing to cooperate for best
interest of justice and lasting fair resolution. In this respect, however, my
client denies consent to appointment of Prof. Shri Abhijit Sen as the sole
arbitrator, apprehending unfair bias and impartiality as Shri Sen happens to
be a bonafide employee and thus beneficiary of Institute for Plasma Research.
6] Referring to Article 15.1 of the Technical Know-how and License Agreement,
which requires an impartial erudite and experienced individual to be appointed
as the arbitrator for purpose of dispute resolution, my Client calls upon you
to agree to the appointment of any single person among the following
distinguished individuals for resolution of dispute purported by you:
(a) Prof. K.L.Chopra (Ex. Director, IIT Kharagpur)  Page 4 of 8 HC-NIC Page 4
of 8 Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST 2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER
(b) Prof.S.S.Major (Professor, Department of Physics, IIT Bombay)
(c) Dr. Murali Shastry (Director, Innovation, DSM; Ex Scientist, NCL Pune]
(d) Prof. Indranil Manna (Director, IIT Kanpur)"
7\. At that stage, the petitioner filed this arbitration petition. This
petition is opposed by the respondent on the ground that the said Clause 15 of
the agreement first requires an attempt to resolve the disputes through the
impartial and experienced individual chosen by both sides. Only thereafter,
the arbitration proceedings can be resorted to. According to the respondent,
therefore, stage for appointment of an arbitrator has not arrived. Second limb
of the respondent's argument is that notice dated 07.04.2015 cannot be treated
as one for appointment of an arbitrator.
8\. Both the contentions cannot be accepted. Firstly, as noted, Clause 15 of
the agreement pertained to arbitration and it provided that, in the event of a
dispute arising between the parties, as a first action towards resolution of
such dispute all pertinent facts will be placed before an impartial erudite
and experienced individual chosen by both parties for arbitration. The clause
further provides that, if the judgement of this individual does not satisfy
one or the other parties, the dispute will be finally settled under the
provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The reference to
such impartial experienced individual to be chosen by both parties thus is for
Page 5 of 8 HC-NIC Page 5 of 8 Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST 2016
O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER arbitration. It is true that in the first portion of this
sentence, it is referred that, as the first action towards resolution of the
disputes such reference would be made. Nevertheless, the later expression,
that the issue will be placed before such person "for arbitration" is
significant and in clear terms refers to the task of such individual as that
of arbitration. Thus, the proceedings that such a person would engage to
resolve the disputes would be in the nature of arbitration. It is, in this
context, that the later expression "that the judgement of such an individual
does not satisfy one or both the parties, the dispute would be finally settled
under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act" has to be seen.
Here again, the term used is the judgement that the individual may render. If
the judgement does not satisfy one or the other party, as per this agreement,
the dispute would be finally settled under the provisions of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act. The only reconciliation between the two sentences would
be that the person to be so chosen by two sides would be the sole arbitrator
and, if the decision of the arbitrator aggrieves one or the other side, the
same would be called in question in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996. Any other interpretation would render either the first or the later
sentence redundant. Reference to the proceedings before the chosen individual
as one of the arbitrator and his decision being one in the nature of
judgement, in my opinion, would clinch the issue. The contention of the
counsel for the respondent that such a person would only be a conciliator
cannot be accepted since a conceliator would never render a judgement and the
question of  Page 6 of 8 HC-NIC Page 6 of 8 Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST
2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER one or the other party being dissatisfied with such
a judgement would not arise. Thus, seen the notice of the petitioner dated
07.04.2015 was clearly one for appointment of an arbitrator. As noted, there
were exchanges between the parties referring to several disputes arising out
of the agreement. In this context, the petitioner in the said notice dated
07.04.2015 asserted that the respondent may agree the appointment of Shri
Abhijit Sen as an impartial experienced person to resolve the disputes as per
Clause 15.1. It was added that the respondent should give such consent within
21 days from the receipt of the letter, failing which, the petitioner would be
constrained to initiate appropriate proceedings under the provisions of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 without any further notice.
9\. Two things thus immediately emerge. Firstly, that the petitioner suggested
the name of Professor Shri Abhijit Sen as an arbitrator and called upon the
respondent to consent to such a name, failing which, the petitioner would be
constrained to proceed in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
Secondly, the respondent also in the reply dated 13.05.2015 understood the
notice in such terms when, in para 5, it was conveyed that the respondent
denies consent to appointment of Professor Abhiji Sen as a sole arbitrator,
"apprehending unfair bias and impartiality as Professor Abhijit Sen appears to
be the bonafide employee and thus beneficiary of institution for Plasma
Resarch". Thus, even the respondent understood the notice of the petitioner
dated 07.04.2015 as one for appointment  Page 7 of 8 HC-NIC Page 7 of 8
Created On Wed Feb 03 01:22:07 IST 2016 O/IAAP/45/2015 ORDER of an arbitrator
in terms of Clause 15 of the agreement.
10\. Though I do not accept the interpretation of the respondent of the said
Clause 15 of the agreement even if such an interpretation is accepted, it can
easily be seen that there is undisputedly an arbitration agreement which would
be, according to the respondent, resorted to once the attempt to resolve the
disputes by the impartial experienced individual fails. In the present case,
when the parties failed to even agree on who such impartial experienced
individual would be, the first requirement of the arbitration clause must be
seen to have been satisfied. It is not as if only when such individual renders
his judgement that the parties can resort to arbitration. Such interpretation
would be too literal, too rigid and plainly not emerging from the reasonable
and conjoint reading of the arbitration clause.
11\. Being a technical matter, let the parties deliberate on the person who
may be requested to act as sole arbitrator. For such purpose S.O. to
12.02.2016.
