6\. In this rejoinder the applicant has failed to contradict the stand of the
respondents. Despite opportunity the applicant has failed to file written
submission.
7\. Having considered the matter in entirety and having delved into the
circulars extracted supra, we are of the considered opinion that the applicant
has been rightly given promotion to Botanist after the period of punishment
was over. The O.A. therefore fails and is dismissed. The M.A.No.350/171/2019
which has been preferred for condonation of delay also stands dismissed.
8\. However, his prayer for promotion to Scientist B, if not already accorded
shall be accorded as per his due turn and as per law. No order as to costs.

3\. The long and short of the matter is that a disciplinary proceeding was
initiated against the applicant while he was a Botanical Assistant Grade-ll,
Indian Botanic Garden (IBG). He was suspended vide order dated 01.09.2005. He
was penalised vide order dated 07.11.2007 imposing a penalty of withholding of
next two increments for two years during July 2008 and 2009 without cumulative
effect. A DPC meeting was held on 29.06.2009, while currency was on. His
promotion was recommended after penalty period was over.
4\. The applicant has claimed promotion to the post of Botanist w.e.f.
23.07.2009 and to Scientist B w.e.f. 30.01.2015, as granted to his junior from
the seniority list dated 01.11.2008.
5\. Per contra, the respondents have refuted the claim citing DOPT OMs dated
14.09.1992 (R-V) and 28.04.2014 (R-V) which are extracted hereunder for
clarity.
The DOPT O.M. dated 14.09.1992 exemplifies the following:-

> effect of penalties on promotion - role of Departmental Promotion Committee"
and stipulates the following No. 22011/4/2007-Estt (D) Government of India
Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pension Department of Personnel &
Training North Block, New Delhi, Dated the 28th April, 2014 OFFICE MEMORANDUM
Subject: Guidelines on treatment of effect of penalties on promotion -- role
of Departmental Promotion Committee *** The Department of Personnel & Training
had in its O.M. No.22011/5/86-Estt (D) dated 10.04.1989 issued consolidated
instructions on Departmental Promotion Committee and matters related thereto.
Para 6.2.3 of said O.M. provides that "before making the overall grading after
considering the CRsfor the relevant years, the DPC should take into account
whether the officer has been awarded any major or minor penalty or whether any
displeasure of any superior officer or authority, has been conveyed to him as
reflected in the ACRs." These guidelines further provide that "the DPC should
not be guided merely by the overall grading, if any, that may be recorded in
the ACRs (now APARs) but should also make its own assessment on the basis of
entries in the CRs (now APARs) because it has been noticed that sometimes the
overall grading in a ACR (now APAR) may be inconsistent with the grades under
various parameters or attributes".
2\. It further provides that an officer whose increments have been withheld or
who has been reduced to a lower stage in the time scale, cannot be considered
on that account to be ineligible for promotion to the higher grade as the
specific penalty of withholding promotion has not been imposed on him/her. The
suitability of the officer for promotion should be assessed by the DPC as and
when occasions arise for such assessment In assessing the suitability, the DPC
wiii take into account the circumstances leading to the imposition of the
penalty and decide whether in the light of the general service record of the
officer and the fact of the imposition of the penalty he should be considered
suitable for promotion. However, even where the DPC considers that despite the
penalty, the officer is suitable for promotion, the officer should not be
actually promoted during the currency of the penalty.
3\. Further this Department's O.M. No. No.22034/5/2004-Estt (D) dated
15.12.2004 provides that a Government servant, on whom a minor penalty of
withholding of increment etc. has been imposed, should be considered for
promotion by the Departmental Promotion Committee which meets after the
imposition of the said penalty and after due consideration offull facts
leading to imposition of the penalty, if he is still considered fit for
promotion, the promotion may be given effect after the expiry of the currency
of the penalty.
4\. The procedure and guidelines to be followed for promotion of Government
servants against whom disciplinary/court proceedings are pending or whose
conduct is under investigation has been laid down in this Department's O.M.
No.22011/4/91-Estt (A) dated 14.9.92 and O.M. No.22034/4/2012-Estt (D) dated
02.11.2012 and 23.1.2014.
5\. The role of Departmental Promotion Committee(DPC) in assessment of the
officers being considered for promotion, including the officer(s) against whom
a chargesheet has been issued or oh whom a penalty has been imposed, has been
examined by the Suprerhe Court in several judgments. The observations of
Supreme Court in some of the important cases are summarized as under:
(a) In A.K. Narula case (AIR 2007 SC 2296), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
observed:
"the guidelines give a certain amount of play in the joints to the DPC by
providing that it need not be guided by the overall grading recorded in the
CRs, but may make its own assessment on  6 the basis of the entries in the
CRs. The DPC is required to make an overall assessment of the performance of
each candidate separately, but by adopting the same standards, yardsticks and
norms. It is only when the process of assessment is vitiated either on the
ground of bias, malafide or arbitrariness, the selection calls for
interference. Where the DPC has proceeded in a fair, impartial and reasonable
manner, by applying the same yardstick and norms to all candidates and there
is no arbitrariness in the process of assessment by the DPC, the court will
not interfere".
(b) In Union of India vs. K.V. Janktraman case (A IH 1991 SC 2010). the
Supreme Court has taken cognizance of role of DPC the case of an officer on
whom a penalty has been imposed and has held that:
"An employee has no right to promotion. He has only right to be considered for
promotion. The promotion to a post and more so, to a selection post, depends
upon several circumstances. To qualify for promotion, the least that is
expected of an employee is to have an unblemished record. That is the minimum
expected to ensure a dean and efficient administration and to protect the
public interest. An employee found guilty of misconduct cannot be placed on
par with the other employees, and his case has to be treated differently In
fact, while considering an employee for promotion his whole record has to be
taken into consideration and if a promotion committee takes the penalties
imposed upon the employee into consideration and denies him the promotion,
such denial is not illegal and unjustified."
(c) In UOl & Ann Vs. S.K. Gael & Ors. (Appeal (Civil) 689/2007
-SLP0-2410/2Q07), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:
"DPC enjoyed full discretion to devise its method and procedure for objective
assessment of suitability and merit of the candidate being considered by it.
Hence interference by High Court is not called for. "
While delivering the above judgement, the Division Bench has observed that:
"...it is now more or less well settled that the evaluation made by an Expert
Committee should not be easily interfered with by the Court which do not have
the necessary expertise to undertake the exercise that is necessary for such
purpose." •V
-' 
6\. It has been brought to the notice of this Department that DPCs have been
adopting varying criteria in assessment of officials undergoing penalty that
are not consistent with the extant instructions of the DOPTfor e.g.,
downgradation of grading in ACR/APAR, denying promotion for specified number
of years, etc.
7\. The matter has been examined in consultation with the Department of Legal
Affairs. It is a settled position that the DPC, within its power to make its
own assessment, has to assess every proposal for promotion, on case to case
basis. In assessing the suitability, the DPC is to take into account the
circumstances leading to the imposition of the penalty and decide, whether in
the light of general service record of the officer and the effect of
imposition of penalty, he/she should be considered suitable for promotion and
therefore, downgradation ofAPARs by one level in all such cases may not be
legally sustainable. Following broad guidelines are laid down in respect of
DPC:
aj DPCs enjoy full discretion to devise their own methods and procedures for
objective assessment of the suitability of candidates who are to be considered
by them, including those officers on whom penalty has been imposed as provided
in DoPT O.M. dated 10.4.89 and O.M. dated 15.12.2004.
b) The DPC should not be guided merely by the overall grading, if any, that
may be recorded in the ACRs/APARs but should make its own assessment on the
basis of the entries in the ACRs/APARs as it has been noticed that sometimes
the overall grading in a ACR/APAR may be inconsistent with the grading under
various parameters or attributes. Before making the overall recommendation
after considering the APARs (earlier ACRs) for the relevant years, the DPC
should take into account whether the officer has been awarded any major or
minor penalty. (Refer para 6.2.1(e) and para 6.2.3 of DoPT OM dated 10.04.89)
c) In case, the disciplinary/criminal prosecution is in the preliminary stage
and the officer is not yet covered under any of the three conditions mentioned
in para 2 of DoPT O.M. dated 14.09.1992, the DPC will assess the suitability
of the officer and if found fit, the officer will be promoted along with other
officers. -As provided in this Department's O.M. dated 02.11.2012, the onus to
ensure that only person with unblemished records are considered for promotion
and  7 disciplinary proceedings, if any, against any person coming in the zone
of consideration are expedited, is that of the administrative
Ministry/Department.
d) if the official under consideration is covered under any of the three
condition mentioned in para 2 of O.M. dated 14.09.1992, the DPC will assess
the suitability of Government servant along with other eligible candidates
without taking into consideration the disciplinary case/criminal prosecution
pending. The assessment of the DPC including 'unfit for promotion' and the
grading awarded are kept in a sealed cover. (Para 2.1 of DoPT OM dated
14.9.92).
e) Para 7 of DoPT OM dated 14.09.92 provides that a Government servant, who is
recommended for promotion by the DPC, but in whose case, any of the three
circumstances on denial of vigilance clearance mentioned in para 2 of ibid
O.M. arises after the recommendations of the DPC are received but before
he/she is actually promoted, will be considered as if his/her case had been
placed in a sealed cover by the DPC. He/she shall not be promoted until he/she
is completely exonerated of the charges against him/her.
f) If any penalty is imposed on the Government servant as a result of the
disciplinary proceedings or if he/she is found guilty in the criminal
prosecution against him/her, the findings of the sealed cover/covers shall not
be acted upon. His/her case for promotion may be considered by the next DPC in
the normal course and having regard to the penalty imposed on him/her (para
3.1 of DoPT OM dated 14.9.92).
g) In assessing the suitability of the officer on whom a penalty has been
imposed, the DPC will take into account the circumstances leading to the
imposition of the penalty and decide whether in the light of general service
record of the officer and the fact of imposition of penalty, the officer
should be considered for promotion. The DPC, after due consideration, has
authority to assess the officer as 'unfit' for promotion. However, where the
DPC considers that despite the penalty the officer is suitable for promotion,
the officer will be actually promoted only after the currency of the penalty
is over (para 13 of DoPT OM dated 10.4.89).
h) Any proposal for promotion has to be assessed by the DPC, on case to case
basis, and the practice of downgradation ofAPARs (earlier ACRs) by one level
in all cases for one time, where a penalty has been imposed in a year included
in the assessment matrix or till the date of DPC should be discontinued
immediately, being legally non-sustalnabfe.
i) While there is no illegality In denying promotion during the currency of
the penalty, denying promotion in such cases after the period of penalty is
over would be in violation of the provisions of Article 20 of the Constitution
j) The appointing authorities concerned should review comprehensively the
cases of Government servants, whose suitability for promotion to a higher
grade has been kept in a sealed cover on the expiry of 6 months from the date
of convening the first Departmental Promotion Committee which had adjudged his
suitability and kept its findings in the sealed cover. Such a review should be
done subsequently also every six months. The review should, inter alia, cover
the progress made in the disciplinary proceedings/criminal prosecution and the
further measures to be taken to expedite the completion. (Para 4 of O.M. dated
14.09.1992).
k) In cases where the disciplinary case/criminal prosecution against the
Government servant is not concluded even after the expiry of two years from
the date of the meeting of the first DPC which kept its findings in respect of
the Government servant in a sealed cover then subject to condition mentioned
in Para 5 of this Department's O.M. dated 14.09.1992, the appointing authority
g) Page 4 of 5 may consider desirability of giving him ad-hoc promotion (Para
5 of this Department's O.M. dated 14.09.1992).
8\. Ail the administrative authorities in the Ministries/Department are
advised to place relevant records, including chargesheet, if any, issued to
the officer concerned, penalty imposed, etc., before the DPC/ACC who will
decide the suitability of officer for promotion keeping in view the general
service records of the officer including the circumstances leading to the
imposition of the chargesheet or penalty imposed. If such an officer is found
suitable, promotion will be given effect after the currency of the penalty is
over.
9\. All Ministries/Departments are, therefore, requested to keep in view the
above guidelines while convening DPC for promotion of the Government servants
on whom either penalty has been imposed or where there are adverse remarks in
the reckonable ACRs/APARs.

respondents. Despite opportunity the applicant has failed to file written
submission.
7\. Having considered the matter in entirety and having delved into the
circulars extracted supra, we are of the considered opinion that the applicant
has been rightly given promotion to Botanist after the period of punishment
was over. The O.A. therefore fails and is dismissed. The M.A.No.350/171/2019
which has been preferred for condonation of delay also stands dismissed.
8\. However, his prayer for promotion to Scientist B, if not already accorded
shall be accorded as per his due turn and as per law. No order as to costs.
