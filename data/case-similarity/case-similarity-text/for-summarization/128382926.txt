petitioner could be included in the properties of husband of the petitioner or

    URBAN DISTRICT, BENGALURU (CCH-24) ANNEXURE -A, IN SO
    FAR AS THE PETR. (ACCUSED NO.2) IS CONCERNED.
         THIS PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED FOR
    ORDERS    ON     01.10.2015  AND   COMING    ON   FOR
    PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE
    THE FOLLOWING:
                               ORDER
The Lokayuktha sought to prosecute husband of the petitioner under Section
13(1)(e) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The case
came to be registered in Crime No.54/2012. The check period was taken as
29.8.1992to 22.6.2012.
2\. In the said proceedings, the Lokayuktha police recorded statement of wife
and thereafter she is made as Accused No.2 on the ground that she has
committed an offence punishable under Section 109, 177, 468, 465 and 471 IPC.
On the basis of the charge sheet filed by the Lokayuktha Police the learned
Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences alleged against both husband
as well as the wife.
3
3\. Being aggrieved, the present petitioner who is wife of Accused No.1 has
presented the present petition seeking to allow revision petition and to set
aside the order dated 16.7.2015 in Spl. C C No.327/2015 on the file of XXIII
Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge/Special Judge under PC Act, Bengalore
Urban District, Bangaluru (CCH-24) taking cognizance of the offences in so far
as the petitioner is concerned.
4\. The allegation against the petitioner is that she has instigated her
husband to legalize the income illegally acquired by him. Further the rental
income of Rs.90,000/- is claimed annually for the Assessment Years 2004-05 to
2008-09 and Rs.1,92,000/- for Assessment Year 2009-10 to 2010-11. It is also
alleged that no agricultural income was claimed for Assessment Years 2006-07
to 2007-08 but later agricultural income is claimed and for the Assessment
Years 1997-98, 1998- 99, 2000-01 to 2005-06 agricultural income is
overwritten/tampered. Thus it is alleged that the petitioner has committed
offences punishable u/s 109, 177, 468,465and 471 of Indian Penal Code.
4
5\. The learned Magistrate on the basis of the charge sheet filed by
Lokayuktha Police took cognizance against husband of the petitioner as well as
the petitioner. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner has filed the present
petition as aforesaid.
6\. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the learned
counsel for the respondent Lokayuktha Police and perused the entire records.
7\. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that materials on record do
not establish the allegations made against the petitioner. The petitioner has
been assessed to income tax on the income earned by her. The properties which
are standing in her name belongs to her and are her self acquired or inherited
properties. The petitioner cannot be held liable for the alleged actions of
her husband. There is no material or evidence in support of the charge sheet
that the petitioner has instigated her husband to amass wealth and the
ingredients of Section 109 of IPC are not satisfied at all.  5
8\. It is submitted that the flat at No.B-201, Mantri Pride Apartment,
Byrasandra, Jayanagar 1st Block, Bengaluru was rented out from 2004 to 2006.
After transfer of husband of the petitioner they are staying in the said flat.
The petitioner has never claimed any rental income in respect of the said Flat
from assessment year 2007-08 onwards.
9\. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the income tax
returns are revised for the Assessment Year 2006 to 2007 to 2010 - 2011. The
respondent police have not verified the original income tax returns with the
Income Tax department before making such an allegation against the petitioner.
10\. The petitioner has claimed her agricultural income and business income
for the assessment years 1997-98 to 2001-02 and the same has been duly
accepted by the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax Department has also
issued revised Assessment orders, thereby accepting the income declared by the
petitioner. Without getting any confirmation  6 from the Income Tax
Department, the respondent police have launched a criminal prosecution which
cannot be sustained.
11\. It is submitted that the respondent police have only considered the
assets standing in the name of the petitioner but failed to take into account
the income as per her annual income tax returns. The petitioner has duly
accounted all the income while filing her income tax returns and the
respondent police is bound to consider the same. The entire investigation is
tainted with mala fides. It is submitted that the Income Tax Office has sent
the income tax returns for the years 2003 - 2007. However, the respondent
police have deliberately not made them a part of the documents produced along
with the charge sheet. The respondent police have suppressed the material
evidence with mala fide intention to frame the petitioner.
12\. The respondent police have concluded in the final report that he is not
going to consider the I.T. returns for Assessment Year 2012-13 for the purpose
of income earned to boost up the assets with a mala fide intention to
implicate the petitioner. It is submitted that the court below has not applied
7 its mind while taking cognizance. The order does not indicate that the
learned Magistrate has applied his mind which is a pre- requirement. The
respondent police have no jurisdiction to investigate offences punishable
exclusively under the Penal Code. On recording the evidence of the petitioner,
petitioner is now arrayed as an accused using the said statements against her
in violation of the fundamental right enshrined under Article 20(2) of the
Constitution.
13\. Lastly it is submitted, in the instant case when the petitioner has
submitted all the documents, agricultural land owned by her, petitioner being
partner of M/s.Vasanatha Khan Estates, with her father, the property standing
in her name could not have been considered to be the assets of her husband,
who is a public servant.
14\. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent Lokayuktha
police submits to dismiss the petition. Taking of cognizance of an offence is
an area exclusively within the domain of learned Magistrate and the learned
Magistrate is not required to record reasons. The learned Magistrate is  8
required to apply his judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of the
offence, or, in other words, to find out whether prima facie case has been
made out for summoning the accused persons. It is a settled proposition of law
that even when there are materials raising strong suspicion against an
accused, the court will be justified in rejecting a prayer for discharge and
in granting an opportunity to the prosecution to bring on record the entire
evidence. It is submitted that legislature advisedly used the expression
"satisfactorily account" casting burden on the accused to give plausible
explanation as to how he acquired the large wealth. Exercise of power under
Section 482 of the Code is an exception and not a rule.
15\. It is submitted that mere fact that the family member is assessed to tax
is not sufficient to discharge the accused unless it is shown that there is
independent income and lastly it is contended that either a public servant or
non-public servant, who has been charged for an offence under Section 3(1) of
the PC Act, in the event of which, the Special Judge has got the  9
jurisdiction to try such offences against the public servant as well as
against a non-public servant.
16\. The learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the
following decisions in support of his contentions.
(i) K Dhanalakshmi vs., The Central Bureau of Investigation, Crl.M.C.5389/2014
Para-22 to advance the argument relating to grounds under which inherent
jurisdiction may be exercised namely, allegations on their face value do not
constitute an offence, where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of
the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act to the institution and
continuance of the proceedings and where a criminal proceeding is manifestly
attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for
the grievance of the aggrieved party.  10
(ii) Pepsi Foods Ltd., & another vs., Special Judicial Magistrate & others
(1998) 5 SCC 749 to advance the contention that summoning of an accused in a
criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a
matter of course.
(iii) Sunil Bharti Mittal vs., Central Bureau of Investigation, (AIR 2015 SC
923) Para-45 to 48 to the effect that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused and formation of such an opinion is to be
stated in the order itself.
(iv) Sanjaysinh Ramrao Chavan vs., Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke & others, (2015)
3 SCC 123) to contend that the whole purpose of the revisional jurisdiction is
to preserve the power in the court to do justice in accordance with the
principles of criminal jurisprudence.
    (v)     Mrs.       Asha         Parveen           S.M.       vs.,     State,
            (Crl.P.No.4645/2012            &     connected         matters)   DD
                                      11
16.7.2015 to submit that mere saying that "perused the records" does not
indicate that the Magistrate has applied his mind and found that the
allegations in the charge sheet papers are sufficient to constitute the
offences alleged.
(vi) C Vishvanatha & another vs., State of Karnataka, (2011(6) Kar. L.J. 632
to the effect that the police officers attached to the Lokayukta office can
only operate within the sphere allotted to them in registering and
investigating the cases in respect of the offences which fall under the PC
Act, 1988 and they cannot investigate into the cases involving offences that
fall exclusively under the Indian Penal Code.
17\. The learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the
following decisions in support of the above contentions.
12
(i) Sonu Gupta v. Deepak Gupta & Ors, (2015 AIR SCW 1199) Para-7 & 8, to
contend that at the stage of cognizance and summoning of accused, Magistrate
is required to apply his judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of
the offence, or, in other words, to find out whether prima facie case has been
made out for summoning the accused persons.
(ii) State of M.P. vs., Awadh Kishore Gupta & Ors., (2004) 1 SCC 691) Para- 7
& 13, to advance the submission, even at the stage of framing charge, the
court has to only prima facie be satisfied about existence of sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused.
(iii) Rajan & Others vs., K Ponmudi & Ors. (2014 AIR SCW 942) Para-22, to
submit that the property in the name of an income tax assessee itself cannot
be a ground to hold that it actually belongs to such an assessee, and  13
(iv) State through CBI, New Delhi v. Jitender Kumar Singh, (AIR 2014 SC 1169)
Para-34 to the effect, an accused person, either a public servant or non-
public servant, who has been charged for an offence under Section 3(1) of the
PC Act, could also be charged for an offence under IPC, in the event of which,
the special judge has got the jurisdiction to try such offences against the
public servant as well as against a non-public servant.
18\. On the basis of the above contentions of the learned counsel for the
parties, the point that arises for consideration is, "Whether the petitioner
has made out a case for interference with the order dated 16.7.2015 in
Spl.C.C.No.327/2015 on the file of XXIII Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge and
Special Judge for P.C. Act at Bangalore City?"
My answer would be in favour of the petitioner for the following reasons:
14
19\. It cannot be disputed that the learned Magistrate has to apply his mind
judiciously as to the prima facie case to proceed against the accused person
and the order taking cognizance shall indicate such an application of mind,
though, the learned Magistrate is not required to assign detailed reasons. The
learned Magistrate is entitled to evaluate the materials on record and cannot
appreciate to satisfy sufficiency of reasons to proceed against the accused at
the time of taking cognizance. In the instant case, the order passed by the
learned Magistrate is to the following effect:
> "Perused the final report. Cognizance is taken against the accused No.1 and
> 2. Register the case  and issue summons to accused No.1 and 2 returnable by
> 10.8.2015".
20\. The above order cannot be said to have passed the test of judicial
application of mind. The first accused is alleged with what offences and
second accused, the petitioner is alleged with what offences, is not to be
borne out from the impugned order. It is no doubt true that it is the
exclusive domain of the learned Magistrate to take cognizance of the offences.
There is  15 sufficient basis for proceeding against the petitioner and
formation of such an opinion ought to have been indicated in the order. The
order is liable to be set aside if no reason is given therein while coming to
the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against the accused, though
the order need not contain detailed reasons.
21\. Mere saying that "perused the records" does not indicate that the
Magistrate has applied his mind and found that the allegations in the charge
sheet papers are sufficient to constitute the offences alleged. It is true, at
that stage, the court is taking cognizance not against the accused persons,
but against the offences alleged. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the court to
examine the charge sheet papers and thereafter, apply its judicious mind to
find out whether the allegations are sufficient to constitute the offences
alleged against the accused, then only by means of giving reasons howsoever
short it may be, the court has to pass appropriate orders. This test is not
forthcoming from the impugned order.
16
22\. In the case on hand, initially the case is registered against husband of
the petitioner and petitioner was interrogated and those statements recorded
through the petitioner are made use of for registering the case against the
petitioner, which is not permissible in view of the right enshrined under
Article 20(3) of the Constitution which provides that no person accused of any
offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.
23\. In order to exercise power of inherent jurisdiction to interdict criminal
prosecution, the circumstances are that no case is made out for the alleged
offences on the available materials, to prevent the abuse of process of the
court and to secure the ends of justice. It is alleged that the petitioner has
instigated her husband to legalize the illegal income of her husband by
purchasing site, flat, complex and buildings in her name. Except the
allegation, the prosecution has not placed any material in support of this
allegation.
24\. It is alleged that petitioner claimed Rs.90,000/- as annual rental from
the flat for the Assessment Years 2004-05 to  17 2008-09 and Rs.1,92,000/- as
annual rental income for assessment years 2009-10 and 2010-11. It is submitted
by the petitioner that in fact the flat was rented out only from 2004-06 and
it was in their occupation from 2006. The petitioner has made available copies
of the income tax returns for the assessment years 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10,
2011-12 and 2012-13 at Annexures-D, D1, D2, D3 & D4 and the respective
assessment orders are produced at Annexures-E, E1, E2 & E3 respectively. If
there is any mistake in the Income tax Returns, revised assessment is
permissible and accordingly revised assessment orders are issued in favour of
the petitioner. The respondent police ought to have verified these things from
the Department before alleging offence against the petitioner under Section
177 of IPC.
25\. It is further allegation against the petitioner that she fabricated the
statements filed along with the Return to the Income Tax Department and only
in the internal statement, agricultural income is claimed and that the
agricultural income is over-written/tampered. The Income Tax Department has
18 already issued Assessment orders thereby accepting the income declared by
the petitioner. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondent police
have not verified the original income tax returns filed by the petitioner with
the Department and the respondent police have not got confirmation from the
Income Tax Department regarding over-writing/tampering. The petitioner has
produced the endorsement dated 19.8.2015 vide Annexure-F to the petition that
the information relating to the Assessment Years 1998-99 to 2002-03 is not
furnished since the records are not available in the office. It was incumbent
upon the respondent police to verify the originals before saying that the
petitioner has tampered or forged the income tax returns.
26\. It is true that just because the person is assessed to Income tax and
income tax is paid is the conclusive proof that the income and the properties
assessed in his/her name are the properties of that assessee. Because by
acquiring the property in the name of family members and by assessing the
income and the properties in his/her name and paying the income tax, one can
easily get through. It depends upon the facts of the  19 particular case for
which the other attendant factors are to be considered. Here in the instant
case, the petitioner claims agricultural income as well as the business income
for which she has been assessed all throughout, which are not duly verified
before asserting that the petitioner has committed the alleged offences.
27\. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the police attached
to Lokayukta office has no authority or is he empowered to register and
investigate the cases relating to offences falling exclusively under the Penal
Code and as such, the exercise of such authority by the Inspector of Police
will have to be held as nothing but an act exercised without jurisdiction. In
this regard it is relevant to refer the decision in C Vishvanatha & another v.
State of Karnataka, (2011(6) Kar.L.J. 632) where this Court has taken the view
that the Police Officers attached to the Lokayukta office can only operate
within the sphere allotted to them in registering and investigating the cases
in respect of the offences which fall under the P.C.Act, 1988 and they cannot
20 investigate into the cases involving offences that fall exclusively under
the Indian Penal Code.
28\. As a counter to this contention, the learned counsel for the respondent
placed reliance on a decision in State through CBI, New Delhi v. Jitender
Kumar Singh (AIR 2014 SC 1169) referred to earlier. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Para-34 of the judgment has observed as follows:
> "34......This Court also held, even if a non-public servant, though charged
> only of offences under Section 420 and Section 120B read with Section
> 420,IPC, he could also be tried by the Special Judge with the aid of sub-
> section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act."
Therefore, the Special Judge trying any case under the PC Act, may also try
any offence, other than an offence specified in Section 3, and not otherwise.
In the instant case, the petitioner is charged exclusively with IPC offences
and not in addition to offences as mentioned in Section 3 of PC Act and
therefore, the respondent police could not have registered and investigated
the case as against the petitioner.
21
29\. The respondent police have already registered the case as against husband
of the petitioner alleging offence of disproportionate assets to his known
sources of income. The prosecution is at liberty to establish the said
offences as alleged against him that he has acquired the properties in the
name of the petitioner also. For the alleged acts of husband of the
petitioner, petitioner cannot be held responsible just by alleging some or the
other offences against her. If at all the properties in the name of the
petitioner could be included in the properties of husband of the petitioner or
not would be decided in the said case as against the husband of the petitioner
itself. In the absence of prima facie materials as against the petitioner for
the offences as alleged against her, the case as against the petitioner is an
abuse of process of the court.
30\. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal
law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. The Magistrate has to
carefully scrutinize the materials brought on record, consider the explanation
given by  22 the parties and to find out the truthfulness of the allegations
or otherwise and then examine if any prima facie case is made out to proceed
against the accused. The court below has failed to apply this test before
taking cognizance of the offences alleged against the petitioner.
31\. In the circumstances, I am of the view that this is a case where
petitioner has made out a case for interference and to set aside the impugned
order so far as the petitioner is concerned. In the result, this petition is
allowed. The impugned order is set aside so far as the petitioner is
concerned.

                               ORDER
The Lokayuktha sought to prosecute husband of the petitioner under Section
13(1)(e) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The case
came to be registered in Crime No.54/2012. The check period was taken as
29.8.1992to 22.6.2012.
2\. In the said proceedings, the Lokayuktha police recorded statement of wife
and thereafter she is made as Accused No.2 on the ground that she has
committed an offence punishable under Section 109, 177, 468, 465 and 471 IPC.
On the basis of the charge sheet filed by the Lokayuktha Police the learned
Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences alleged against both husband
as well as the wife.
other offences against her. If at all the properties in the name of the
petitioner could be included in the properties of husband of the petitioner or
not would be decided in the said case as against the husband of the petitioner
itself. In the absence of prima facie materials as against the petitioner for
the offences as alleged against her, the case as against the petitioner is an
abuse of process of the court.
30\. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal
law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. The Magistrate has to
carefully scrutinize the materials brought on record, consider the explanation
given by  22 the parties and to find out the truthfulness of the allegations
or otherwise and then examine if any prima facie case is made out to proceed
against the accused. The court below has failed to apply this test before
taking cognizance of the offences alleged against the petitioner.

petitioner has made out a case for interference and to set aside the impugned
order so far as the petitioner is concerned. In the result, this petition is
