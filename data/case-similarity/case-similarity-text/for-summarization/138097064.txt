Power to ascertain net profits or market-value.—If the Court sees reason to think that the annual net profits or the market-value of any such land, house or garden as is mentioned in section 7, paragraphs (v) and (vi), have or has been wrongly estimated, the Court may, for the purpose of computing the fee payable in any suit therein mentioned, issue a commission to any proper person directing him to make such local or other investigation as may be necessary, and to report thereon to the Court.
10. Procedure where net profit or market-value wrongly estimated.—
(i) If in the result of any such investigation the Court finds that the net
profits or market-value have or has been wrongly estimated, the Court, if the
estimation has been excessive, may in its discretion refund the excess paid as
such fee: but, if the estimation has been insufficient, the Court shall
require the plaintiff to pay so much additional fee as would have been payable
had the said market-value or net profits been rightly estimated.
(ii) In such case the suit shall be stayed until the additional fee is paid.
If the additional fee is not paid within such time as the Court shall fix, the
suit shall be dismissed. 1[***]

Where the amount of mesne profits is left to be ascertained in the course of the execution of the decree, if the profits so ascertained exceed the profits claimed, the further execution of the decree shall be stayed until the difference between the fee actually paid and the fee which would have been payable had the suit comprised the whole of the profits so ascertained is paid. If the additional fee is not paid within such time as the Court shall fix, the suit shall be dismissed.
12. Decision of questions as to valuation.—
(i) Every question relating to valuation for the purpose of determining the
amount of any fee chargeable under this Chapter on a plaint or memorandum of
appeal, shall be decided by the Court in which such plaint or memorandum, as
the case may be, is filed, and such decision shall be final as between the
parties to the suit.
(ii) But whenever any such suit comes before a Court of appeal, reference or
revision, if such Court considers that the said question has been wrongly
decided, to the detriment of the revenue, it shall require the party by whom
such fee has been paid to pay so much additional fee as would have been
payable had the question been rightly decided, and the provisions of section
10, paragraph (ii), shall apply.
13. Refund of fee paid on memorandum of appeal.—If an appeal or plaint, which has been rejected by the lower Court on any of the grounds mentioned in the 1Code of Civil Procedure, is ordered to be received, or if a suit is remanded in appeal, on any of the grounds mentioned in 2section 351 of the same Code, for a second decision by the lower Court, the Appellate Court shall grant to the appellant a certificate, authorizing him to receive back from the Collector the full amount of fee paid on the memorandum of appeal:—If an appeal or plaint, which has been rejected by the lower Court on any of the grounds mentioned in the 1Code of Civil Procedure, is ordered to be received, or if a suit is remanded in appeal, on any of the grounds mentioned in 2section 351 of the same Code, for a second decision by the lower Court, the Appellate Court shall grant to the appellant a certificate, authorizing him to receive back from the Collector the full amount of fee paid on the memorandum of appeal\:" Provided that, if in, the case of a remand in appeal, the order of remand shall not cover the whole of the subject-matter of the suit, the certificate so granted shall not authorize the appellant to receive back more than so much fee as would have been originally payable on the part or parts of such subject-matter in respect whereof the suit has been remanded.
14. Refund of fee on application for review of judgment.—Where an 1application for a review of judgment is presented on or after the ninetieth day from the date of the decree, the Court, unless the delay was caused by the applicant’s laches, may, in its discretion, grant him a certificate authorizing him to receive back from the Collector so much of the fee paid on the application as exceeds the fee which would have been payable had it been presented before 2such day.—Where an 3application for a review of judgment is presented on or after the ninetieth day from the date of the decree, the Court, unless the delay was caused by the applicant’s laches, may, in its discretion, grant him a certificate authorizing him to receive back from the Collector so much of the fee paid on the application as exceeds the fee which would have been payable had it been presented before 1such day."
15. Refund where Court reverses or modifies its former decision on ground of mistake.—Where an application for a review of judgment is admitted, and where, on the rehearing, the Court reverses or modifies its former decision on the ground of mistake in law or fact, the applicant shall be entitled to a certificate from the Court authorizing him to receive back from the Collector so much of the fee paid on the 1[application] as exceeds the fee payable on any other application to such Court under the Second Schedule to this Act, No. 1, clause (b) or clause (d). But nothing in the former part of this section shall entitle the applicant to such certificate where the reversal or modification is due, wholly or in part, to fresh evidence which might have been produced at the original hearing.

of the mode of settlement of dispute referred to in section 89 of the Code of

*[19A. Relief where too high a Court-fee has been paid.—Where any person on applying for the probate of a will or letters of administration has estimated the property of the deceased to be of greater value than the same has afterwards proved to be, and has consequently paid too high a Court-fee thereon, if within six months after the true value of the property has been ascertained, such person produces the probate or letters to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 1[for the local area] in which the probate or letters has or have been granted, and delivers to such Authority a particular inventory and valuation of the property of the deceased, verified by affidavit or affirmation, and if such Authority is satisfied that a greater fee was paid on the probate or letters than the law required, the said authority may—
(a) cancel the stamp on the probate or letters, if such stamp has not been
already cancelled;
(b) substitute another stamp for denoting the Court-fee which should have been
paid thereon; and
(c) make an allowance for the difference between them as in the case of
spoiled stamps, or repay the same in money, at his discretion. ]
*[19B. Relief where debts due from a deceased person have been paid out of his estate.—Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of such Authority that an executor or administrator has paid debts due from the deceased to such an amount as, being deducted out of the amount or value of the estate, reduces the same to a sum which, if it had been the whole gross amount or value of the estate, would have occasioned a less Court-fee to be paid on the probate or letters of administration granted in respect of such estate than has been actually paid thereon under this Act, such Authority may return the difference, provided the same be claimed within three years after the date of such probate or letters. But when, by reason of any legal proceeding, the debts due from the deceased have not been ascertained and paid, or his effects have not been recovered and made available, and in consequence thereof the executor or administrator is prevented from claiming the return of such difference within the said term of three years, the said Authority may allow such further time for making the claim as may appear to be reasonable under the circumstances.
*[19C. Relief in case of several grants.—Whenever 1[***] a grant of probate or letters of administration has been or is made in respect of the whole of the property belonging to an estate, and the full fee chargeable under this Act has been or is paid thereon, no fee shall be chargeable under the same Act when a like grant is made in respect of the whole or any part of the same property belonging to the same estate. Whenever such a grant has been or is made in respect of any property forming part of an estate, the amount of fees then actually paid under this Act shall be deducted when a like grant is made in respect of property belonging to the same estate, identical with or including the property to which the former grant relates.]
*[19D. Probates declared valid as to trust-property though not covered by Court-fee.—The probate of the will, or the letters of administration of the effects, of any person deceased heretofore or hereafter granted shall be deemed valid and available by his executors or administrators for recovering, transferring or assigning any moveable or immoveable property whereof or whereto the deceased was possessed or entitled, either wholly or partially as a trustee, notwithstanding the amount or value of such property is not included in the amount or value of the estate in respect of which a Court-fee was paid on such probate or letters of administration.]
*[19E. Provision for case where too low a Court-fee has been paid on probates, etc.—Where any person on applying for probate or letters of administration has estimated the estate of the deceased to be of less value than the same has afterwards proved to be, and has in consequence paid too low a Court-fee thereon, the Chief Controlling Revenue-Authority 1[for the local area] in which the probate or letters has or have been granted, may, on the value of the estate of the deceased being verified by affidavit or affirmation, cause the probate or letters of administration to be dully stamped on payment of the full Court-fee which ought to have been originally paid thereon in respect of such value and of the further penalty, if the probate or letters is or are produced within one year from the date of the grant, of five times, or if it or they is or are produced after one year from such date, of twenty times, such proper Court-fee, without any deduction of the Court-fee originally paid on such probate or letters: Provided that, if the application be made within six months after the ascertainment of the true value of the estate and the discovery that too low a Court-fee was at first paid on the probate or letters, and if the said Authority is satisfied that such fee was paid in consequence of a mistake or of its not being known at the time that some particular part of the estate belonged to the deceased, and without any intention of fraud or to delay the payment of the proper Court-fee, the said Authority may remit the said penalty, and cause the probate or letters to be duly stamped on payment only of the sum wanting to make up the fee which should have been at first paid thereon. ]
*[19F. Administrator to give proper security before letters stamped under section 19E.—In case of letters of administration on which too low a Court-fee has been paid at first, the said Authority shall not cause the same to be duly stamped in manner aforesaid until the administrator has given such security to the Court by which the letters of administration have been granted as ought by law to have been given on the granting thereof in case the full value of the estate of the deceased had been then ascertained. ]
*[1[19G. Executors, etc., not paying full Court-fee on probates, etc., within six months after discovery of under-payment.—Where too low a Court-fee has been paid on any probate or letters of administration in consequence of any mistake, or of its not being known at the time that some particular part of the estate belonged to the deceased, if any executor or administrator acting under such probate or letters does not, within six months 2[***] after the discovery of the mistake or of any effects not known at the time to have belonged to the deceased, apply to the said Authority and pay what is wanting to make up the Court-fee which ought to have been paid at first on such probate or letters, he shall forfeit the sum of one thousand rupees and also a further sum at the rate of ten rupees per cent., on the amount of the sum wanting to make up the proper Court-fee.]]
1[19H. Notice of applications for probate or letters of administration to be
given to Revenue-authorities; and procedure thereon.—
(1) Where an application for probate or letters of administration is made to
any Court other than a High Court the Court shall cause notice of the
application to be given to the Collector.
(2) Where such an application as aforesaid is made to a High Court, the High
Court shall cause notice of the application to be given to the Chief
Controlling Revenue-authority 2[for the local area in which the High Court is
situated].
(3) The Collector within the local limits of whose revenue-jurisdiction the
property of the deceased or any part thereof is, may at any time inspect or
cause to be inspected, and take or cause to be taken copies of, the record of
any case in which application for probate or letters of administration has
been made; and if, on such inspection or otherwise, he is of opinion that the
petitioner has underestimated the value of the property of the deceased, the
Collector may, if he thinks fit, require that attendance of the petitioner
(either in person or by agent) and take evidence and inquire into the matter
in such manner as he may think fit, and, if he is still of opinion that the
value of the property has been under-estimated, may require the petitioner to
amend the valuation.
