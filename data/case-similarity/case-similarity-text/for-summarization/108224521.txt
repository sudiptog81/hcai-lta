Appearance Shri B. L. Narasimhan, Advocate - for the appellant Shri Govind
Dixit, DR - for the respondent CORAM: Honble Justice G. Raghuram, President
Honble Mr. Sahab Singh, Member (Technical) Final Order No.57226, dated
30.07.2013 Per Justice G. Raghuram :
Heard Mr. Lakshmi Narasimhan, Ld. Counsel for the assessee/appellant and Shri
Govind Dixit, Ld. Departmental Representative for Revenue. The appeal is
preferred against the adjudication order dated 31.12.2012 passed by the
Commissioner of Service Tax, New Delhi-III. The order confirmed service tax
liability of Rs.47,70,236/-; dropped demand of Rs.64,41,366/-; ordered
recovery of interest under Section 75 of the Finance Act, 1994; and imposed
penalties under Sections 76, 77 and 78 of the Act. Proceedings were initiated
against the assessee on assumption by Revenue that during 10-09-2004 to
31-03-2007, assessee had remitted royalty of Rs.10,21,23,166/- to M/s. Musashi
Seimitsu Industry Company Ltd., Japan for providing technical know-how for its
products to the assessee; but had failed to obtain registration as and
Intellectual Property Service (IPS) Provider; failed to file returns and to
remit service tax for the taxable service covered by the provisions of Section
65 (105) (zzr) of the Act as defined in Section 65 (55a) and (55b).
2\. In its response to the Show Cause Notice dated 29-10-2009, the assessee
specifically contended that it had not been the recipient of the IPS from the
Japanese holding company since that company was transferring technologies for
manufacture of specific projects like gears, crankshafts and other driving
elements to the two wheeler industry and the royalty paid for the use of such
technology did not constitute intangible property under any law for the time
being in force in India within the meaning of the taxable service as defined
in Section 65 (55a) and (55b) of the Act. The adjudicating authority in
para-17 of the impugned order considered this contention of the assessee. To
the extent relevant for the purposes of this appeal suffice it to notice that
the adjudicating authority concluded that the holding company of the assessee
had not transferred or delivered any goods but had supplied specifications of
tools, its designs, its process and its manner manufacture, etc., which
constitute intangible goods. With regard to the issue whether these comprise a
right to untenable property under any law for the time being in force, the
definitional requirement of Section 65 (55a), the adjudicating authority
disposed of this contention by this singular observation which may be
extracted; All these are Intangible things and needs protection of law under
IPR, therefore, fall under IPS. It is automatic and this aspect is conceded
faintly by the Ld. Departmental Representative as well, that needing the
protection of law is no part of the definitional requirement. The definition
clearly and unambiguously enjoins that to constitute the Intellectual Property
Rights there should be a right to intangible property, namely, trade marks,
designs, patents or any other similar intangible property, under any law for
the time being in force, but excluding the copy right. What criterion would
satisfy intangible property, to constitute the right to such property under
any law for the time being in force, is an analysis that is inevitable and a
condition precedent, for visiting the assessee with the liability to remit
service tax, under the provisions of the Act.
3\. As the adjudicating order rescinds no reasons nor indicates any process of
analysis on this vital issue, the adjudication order cannot be sustained.
4\. Ld. Counsel for the appellant further contended, a contention not
presented before the adjudicating authority earlier that since the agreement
under which the technology know-how was transferred from the Japanese holding
company to the appellant was entered into in the year 2003, whereby the know-
how and technology was transferred as an one time event and prior to
introduction of the taxable service under Section 65 (105) (zzr) of the Act
with effect from 10-09-2004; the subsequent royalty payments in
instalments/periodically, even when paid after introduction of the taxable
service, would not create a taxable liability, since the provision of the
service occurred on the entering into the agreement. In support of this
contention reliance is placed on the judgement of the Tribunal reported in
2009 (15)S.T.R. 713 (Tri.  Del.), in Modi-Mundipharma Pvt. Ltd. Vs. C.C.E.,
Meerut and an interim order reported in 2012-TIOL-931-CESTAT-DEL in Denso
Haryana Pvt. Ltd. Vs. C.C.E., Delhi III. Ld. Counsel for the appellant also
contended that the Supreme Court at paragraphs 27 and 28 of the judgement in
20th Century Finance Corpn. Ltd. and Another Vs. State of Maharashtra reported
in [2000] 119 STC 182 (SC), clarified the position as to when a taxable
service is said to have been rendered.
5\. Since the issue as to whether the transfer of technology and know-how by
the Japanese holding company to the assessee fulfils the requirements of
Section 65 (105) (zzr) read with the definition of Intellectual Property
Rights in section 65 (55 a), has not been considered by the adjudicating
authority. we are of the considered view that it is appropriate to remit the
matter for consideration afresh and grant liberty to the assessee to raise any
other issue as well before the adjudicating authority including as to whether
the provisions of Section 65 (105) (zzr) are applicable to the assessees
transactions, since the payment of royalties event though subsequent were
pursuant to an agreement which was earlier to introduction of the taxable
service. The assessee shall file a Memorandum of Written Submissions within 3
weeks from today before the adjudicating authority on this aspect but shall
not however be entitled to personal hearing again. Any case supporting the
assessees contentions may also be appended to the Memorandum of Written
Submissions, within the time stipulated herein.
6\. On the preceding analysis, the adjudication order dated 31.12.2012, in
Order-in-Original No.105/AKM/CST/ADJ/2012 is set aside and the matter is
remanded to the Commissioner of Service Tax, Delhi-III for adjudication and
determination de novo. There shall be no order as to costs however.
