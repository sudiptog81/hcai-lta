                                        ORDER
Per Sanjay Garg, Judicial Member:
These three appeals preferred by Revenue are relating to different assessment
years but connected to the same assessee. Since common issues have been raised
in these appeals,hence, these are taken together for disposal with this
consolidated order. The facts for the sake of convenience are taken from the
appeal No.4548/M/12.
ITA No.4548/M/12.(Assessment Year 2008-09)
2\. This appeal has been directed against the order of the CIT(A) dated
30.04.12.The revenue has raised the following grounds of appeal: "1.
          i)      The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case
                                       2                 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                            Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                .
without appreciating the fact that the agreement between the assessee and the
deductee speaks that the copy rights is vested with the producer (in respect
of production charges), which evidences the fact that the agreement is in the
nature of Royalty agreement which attracts the provisions of section 194J of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 for deduction of TDS.
ii) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case by
holding that the dubbing expenses/print processing fees as contract, this work
involves technical expertise which can only be executed by competent persons
in the respective field thus dubbing expenses/pring processing fees attracts
the provisions of section 194J of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for deduction of
TDS.
iii) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case by
relying on the decision of ACIT Vs. Manish Dutt (2011) 12 Taxmann. Com 50
without appreciating that in the said decision, the payments made by the
assessee was for use of rented premises which falls within the purview of
section 194 J of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The ld. CIT(A) failed to
distinguish the instant case with the case of ACIT Vs. Manish Dutt (supra)
which only attracted the provision of section 194 j and not otherwise.
iv) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case
without distinguishing the provisions of section 194C and section 194J, the
former speaks of only payments related to contractual activities, however, the
latter provides for fees for professional or technical services as in the case
of the assessee in question.
2\. The appellant craves leave to amend or alter any ground or add a new
ground which may be necessary at the time of the hearing of the case or
thereafter.
                                             3                 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                                  Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                      .
3\. The order of the CIT(A) being erroneous be set aside and ld. A.O.'s order
be restored."
3\. The assessee is a limited company and is inter-alia engaged in the
business of production of cinematographic motion pictures and small screen
programmes through assigned producers. A survey operation u/s 133A was carried
out in the case of the assessee and it was found that the assessee had debited
"production expenses" and "dubbing expenses/print processing fees" on which
the tax was deducted under section 194C of the Act. The AO was of the view
that the "dubbing expenses/print processing fees" and "production expenses"
were in the nature of 'fees for technical services' and 'royalty'
respectively, and hence the tax should have been deducted under section 194J
of the Act @10%,insteadof @2% deducted by the assessee under section 194C,
with respect to the payments made during the year. After considering the reply
of the assessee in this regard, he computed short deduction of tax under
section 201(1) and raised demand of Rs.4,74,34,481/-.However, the ld. CIT(A)
On appeal by the assessee while allowing the appeal of the assessee deleted
the above said demand of tax. Aggrieved there from, the revenue is in appeal
before us.
4\. 1.Ground no.1(i):Production Expenses:
The A. O. observed that the assessee had made default of short
payment/deduction of tax at Rs. 105927702/-. However he noticed that a sum of
Rs. 61202380/- was liable to be reduced from the said amount as the payee 4
ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
companies had already deposited the due tax on the income received by them,
the confirmation of which was produced by the assessee. He thus made the
demand of Rs. 44725322/- under this head under section 201 of the act.While
doing so, the A.O. mainly relied upon the article II(b) of the production
agreement between Sahara One Media and Entertainment Ltd (referred as 'the
producer') and Ananda Film and Tele-communications Pvt. Ltd. (referred as
assigned producer),wherein, it has been mentioned that the 'assigned producer'
hereby expressly represents and warrants to the 'producer' that it owns the
exclusive, un-encumbered, unrestricted and effective rights of copyright in
perpetuity of the said programme and all its elements like concept/theme,
creative, format process flow and management, script screenplay with dialogues
literary content, characters, visuals, audio, songs and musical works and
performancesetc, and has obtained the required lawfully authority from
PPL/IPRS/TPPL/ respective producers or right holders, if required to use the
material owned by others as part of the said programme( subject to, however,
the approval of the producer) and absolutely grant it to the 'producer' and
that neither prior to signing the agreement, it has granted, transferred
and/or assigned the said rights of the said programme or parts thereof to any
other person, party, company or organization whatsoever, nor would grant,
transfer, assign, use and exploit the same in any way ever except this first
and conclusive assignment to 'the producer' herein.
                                             5                 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                                  Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                      .
5\. The AO observed that the above agreement would fall under the definition
of the royalty as there was transfer of copyrights and therefore, any payment
under the above agreement was liable for deduction u/s194J. He further
observed that the producer of a programme could not be considered as
contractor or subcontractor of the assessee company as regards the television
filmmakingwas concerned. He was actually the author of the film who was fully
in command of making the film. Therefore, the specific clause regarding the
transfer of right was inserted in the agreement.
6\. In appeal, The ld. CIT(A), however, observed that it was evident from the
sample Agreement that the assessee used to hire the producers (who first
approach the assessee) for producing TV programmes for it, on a commissioned
work basis and pay consideration to such assigned producer for producing the
programmes. He further observed that under the provisions of section 194C of
the Act, it has been provided that expression 'work' shall include, inter
alia, broadcasting and telecasting including production of programmes for such
broadcasting and telecasting.Therefore, where the payment was made for
production of TV programmes, it was covered by provisions of section 194C. He
further observed that the principal purpose of entering into the Agreements
was to get the programmes produced through the assigned producers on a
commissioned work basis. The assessee was the exclusive owner of the
programmes to be produced by the producer. He therefore held that the payment
for carrying out the work of producing 6 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One
Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
programmes on behalf of assessee was in the nature of 'work' as defined in
section 194C of the Act and the same could not be treated as 'fees for
technical services' or 'royalty' under section 194J of the Act. While holding
so he relied upon the judgement of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
'CIT vs. PrasarBharti Broadcasting Corpn. Of India' [292 ITR 580]. In the said
case, the assessee was a government corporation engaged in controlling various
TV channels of Doordarshan. It was held that the payments made by it to
various producers of programmes were covered under Explanation III(b) to
section 194C of the Act, as acontract for production of programmes for
broadcasting or telecasting and not as a fee for professional services or
royalty; hence the tax deduction at source was required to be made @2% under
section 194C of the Act and section 194J of the Act was not applicable. He
therefore accepted the contention of the assesse that tax was deductable @2%
under section 194 C of the act and not @ 10% under section194 J of the act.
7\. Before us, the submission of the ld. AR has been that in fact the assessee
being the producer had been the sole owner of the programme. There was no
question of purchase of copyright etc. from the assigned producer as such
rights vested in the producer i.e. assessee from the inception or starting of
the production of the programme. He has further explained the sequence of
events of production as under:
. Assigned Producer approaches the assessee with the concept/theme for
production of the serial;
                                            7                 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                                 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                     .
    .     The assessee agrees to become main producer of the serial made
          according to the agreed concept/theme;
    .     Assigned Producer would produce the serial in accordance to the
          concept/theme of the serial for the assessee;
    .     Assigned Producer is responsible for day-to-day production of the
          serial;
    .     The assessee would oversee and monitor the overall production activity of
          the serial;"
8\. The ld. AR has further submitted that in view of the above sequence of
events, the principal-contractor relationship gets established between the
assessee and the Assigned Producers wherein the Assigned Producer would
produce the serial for the assessee and the assessee would supervise the
production activity undertaken by the Assigned Producer.
9\. On the other hand the ld. DR has submitted that the production expenses in
this case would fall under the definition of royalty and tax was liable to be
deducted u/s 194J of the act. He has relied upon the A.O.
10\. We have considered the submissions of the ld. Representatives of the
parties and have also gone through the record. First of all we have to see the
intention of the parties to the contract as to whether the contract was for
production of programme or for the sale or transfer of copy rights etc. of the
programme produced by the so called assigned producer. Clauses of an agreement
cannot be read into isolation but the true intention behind the contract can
be gathered by reading all the clauses together in harmony with each other and
also taking into consideration the inter se relation between those clauses. A
view cannot be formed about the nature & object of a contract by 8 ITA
No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
reading a clause of it in isolation and in ignorance of the other relevant
clauses therein.
11\. We have gone through the various clauses of the sample agreement placed
in file before us and a harmonious reading of the whole agreement reveals that
the said agreement is essentially an agreement to produce tele- serials and
not for transfer of copy rights etc. of a already produced prograame of
another producer. The clause (II)b of the agreement which has been considered
by AO when read with other clauses of the agreement clearly reveals that the
purpose & object of the said clause in the agreement is to recognize the
vesting of all the right in the producer (assessee)relating to the programme
to be produced by the assigned producer which can be said to be a contract for
the purpose of section 194C. Some of the relevant extract from the clauses of
the agreement, for the sake of convenience, are reproduced below:

restrain/prohibit 'The PRODUCER' from questioning/disputing the accuracy of

shall be entitled, decides other remedies, to appropriately valuate and
fix/revise a lower Gross Consideration for affected proportion and

packaging of 'the said PROGRAMME', from the payables of first lot of
Episodes); and
(xi) Any other direct and indirect expenses, including but not limited to 'The
ASSIGNED PRODUCER's remuneration etc., whatsoever."
12\. A perusal of clause II(a) of the agreement shows that transaction as in
relation to production of the programme by the assigned producer solely for
the producer and strictly according to the requirements and specifications of
the producer or as approved by the producer. As per clause II (1) (i), the
producer shall be entitled to have a nominee present during any stage of
progress of production and reserves the right to effectively advise regarding
the different components and the stages of the production of the programme, as
mentioned there in, and such advice shall be binding on assigned producer. As
per clause(n) the producer will be the absolute owner and perpetual copyright
holder of the said programme in which the assigned producer shall have no
rights/interests and/or claims whatsoever. As per clause (o) any suggestions
and/or value additions advised by the producer in the programme shall have to
be incorporated by the assigned producer and he shall, in no event, deviate
from the approved format, process flow and management and script-screenplay
etc. of the programme. Further as per clause (r), 'the producer' shall be
entitled to examine, verify and audit the project specific books and accounts
as well as the production progress of the assigned producer for the said
programme from 14 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
time to time and the assigned producer shall not in any way restrain/prohibit
'the producer' the producer' from questioning/disputing the accuracy of any
transaction, payment and action/inaction for the project at a later date. The
gross consideration clause clearly reveals that the 'consideration' payable by
the producer to the assigned producer is relating to different constituents of
the 'to be produced programme' as mentioned under clause IV(b), but does not
include any separate consideration for transfer or assignment of copyrights
etc. of the programme. The clause II(b) relied upon by the AO , as reproduced
above, when read with the other clauses of the agreement some of which have
been discussed above, clearly reveals that the agreement in question is an
agreement to produce the programme and not for transfer of copyrights etc.
Hence clause (II)b of the article cannot be interpreted in a manner to give a
different meaning to the agreement in question The assignment or vesting of
copy rights etc. in the programme are incidental to the main object of the
agreement or transactions in question. When a contactor produces a programme
on behalf of other, it is obvious that all the rights including copy rights
etc. will vest in the producer and the assigned producer/contractor will not
be left with any control or right over the programme and such rights of the
producer have been recognized with the said assignment clause, which is
incidental to the main object of the contract. The observation of the AO that
assigned producer has an absolute contract over the rights of the programme is
falsified from the perusal of the different clauses of the agreement. In view
of our above 15 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
discussion of the matter, it is held that the agreement in question was an
agreement to produce the programme by the assigned producer i.e., contractor
on behalf of the producer i.e., assessee.
13\. Now coming to the legal aspect of the case, The relevant extract of the
operative provisions of section 194C and Explanation III is reproduced below:
> "194C(1) Any person responsible for paying any sum to any resident
> (hereinafter in this section referred to as the contractor) for carrying out
> any work(including supply of labour for carrying out any work) in pursuance
> of a contract between the contractor and- ......
> ........
> Explanation III.- For the purposes of this section, the expression "work"
> shall also include-
          (a)    Advertising;
          (b)    Broadcasting and telecasting including production of programmes
          for such broadcasting or telecasting;
          (c)    carriage of goods and passengers by any mode of transport other
          than by railways;
          (d)    catering
          ...................."
> "194J. Fees for professional or technical services.- (1) Any person, not
> being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, who is responsible for
> paying to a resident any sum by way of--
> (a) fees for professional services, or
> (b) fees for technical services, or
> (c) royalty, or
> (d) any sum referred to in clause (va) of section 28, 16 ITA
> No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
> .
> shall, at the time of credit of such sum to the account of the payee or at
> the time of payment thereof in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by
> any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct an amount equal to ten per cent
> of such sum as income-tax on income comprised therein : ..........."
14\. perusal of the above extract of the provisions of section 194C, reveals
that clause (b) to Explanation III to section 194C specifically covers the
activity of production of programmes, hence, the payment made to the
contractor i.e. Assigned Producer for production of programme specifically
falls within the ambit of clause(b) to Explanation III to section 194C,
whereas the provisions of section 194J are general in nature. It is settled
law that when an activity or transaction is covered by the specific provisions
of the act, then resort must be have to that specific provision and not to the
general provisions especially when general provisions are contrary, departing
from, giving a different intention, interpretation or meaning in any manner as
compared to the said specific provisions. It is thus clear that the provisions
of section 194C would prevail over section 194J of the Act.
15\. In this case section 194C clearly states that payment for production of
programmes constitutes payments for 'work' under section 194C, hence, the
assessee rightly deducted TDS u/s 194C at the rate of 2% on payments made to
the contractor (Assigned Producer). When faced with somewhat similar issue,
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of 'CIT vs. PrasarBharti Broadcasting
Corpn. Of India'(supra) has observed as under:
                                             17                ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                                  Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                      .
"... We are unable to agree with this submission. We observe that Explanation
III, which was introduced simultaneously with section 194J, is very specific
in its application to not only broadcasting and telecasting but also include
'production of programmes for such broadcasting and telecasting. If on the
same date, two provisions are introduced in the Act, one specific to the
activity sought to be taxed and the other in more general terms, resort must
be had to the specific provision which manifests the intention of the
Legislature. It is not, therefore, possible to accept the contention of the
Revenue that programmes produced for television, including 'commissioned
programmes; will fall outside the realm of section 194C Explanation III of the
Act. We find no infirmity in the view taken by the ITAT which we hereby
affirm....."
16\. The ld. CIT(A) has rightly observed that the above decision of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court squarely covers the case of the assessee. In view of
the above stated settled legal position, the assessee rightly deducted the TDS
for production expenses in the nature of contract payment at 2% in accordance
with the provisions of Section 194C. We do not find any infirmity in the order
of the CIT(A) on this issue and the same is upheld. This issue is accordingly
decided against the assessee.
Ground No.1(ii)(iii)&(iv): Dubbing Expenses/Print Processing Fees:
                                             18                ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                                  Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                      .
17\. The AO held that the payments in respect of "Dubbing Expenses/Print
Processing Fees" are in the nature of 'fees for technical/professional
service. Therefore, the tax should have been deducted under section 194J of
the Act instead of section 194C. He observed that the work of processing of
film is creative working which is performed by skilled and technically
competent persons. It is a technical work performed by technically competent
person with expertise in the field and therefore, any payment for this
expenditure was liable for TDS u/s 194J. The ld. CIT(A) however observed that
the dubbing and processing of films are processes in the production activity
undertaken by the assessee. The service of dubbingthus was in the nature of
'work' and would fall under section 194C of the Act. He furtherobserved that
the service rendered in regard to payment of Print Processing Fees was also in
the nature of 'work' and would fall under section 194C of the Act in view of
similar processes involved. He therefore deleted the demand of tax of
Rs.27,09,159/- under section 201(1) made by the AO under this head.
18\. Before us the ld. AR has submitted that both dubbing and processing are
part of production activity of the film/serial undertaken by the assessee. The
dubbing is nothing but an ancillary activity to the production of serial/films
. It is done to make sure that the serial communicates with the targeted
audience and to make it ready for telecast. He has further submitted that
Print Processing fees is paid for processing of raw films and making extra
copies of the same. At the time of shooting of the serial/film, the serial is
shot using raw 19 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
.
images/films. Such raw films are not in editable or printable format. Further,
serials are required to be telecast in digital formats. Conversion of such raw
films is necessary to make the film editable and suitable for telecast.
Accordingly, processing fees are paid wholly and solely for the purpose of
making the film ready for editing and ready for other processes of production.
Thus, it is a part of production process of a serial. On the other hand the
ld. DR has relied upon the AO.
19\. A perusal of the section 194C reveals that the activities under this
section include broadcasting and telecasting including production of
programmes for such broadcasting or telecasting. Hence all the activities from
the production of the programme up to its telecast are included under this
section. The ld. CIT(A) has rightly observed that production of programmes is
nothing but combination of processes right from planning Schedule to post
production processes enabling the serial to be ready for telecast. He rightly
held that the dubbing charges and processing fees being a part of production
of television serials and programmes, are squarely covered under the ambit of
specific provisions of section 194C of the Act and liable to TDS at the rate
of 2%. The general provisions of section 194J as observed above, are not
attracted in this case. The findings of the ld. CIT (A) on this issue are
hereby upheld. So far the ground of appeal relating to wrong application of
law by the CIT(A) is concerned, we may observe that, in view of the above
discussion, the issues involved under these heads have been decided in favour
of the assessee, 20 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012 Sahara One Media & Entertainment
Ltd.
.
independently, on merits, even without considering the application or non-
application of any such case law. Thus we do not find any force in the
contention of the revenue in this respect. The isssues involved in Ground No.
1(ii)(iii)&(iv) are accordingly decided against the revenue.
20\. Grounds No.2 & 3 are general in nature and do not require any
adjudication by us.
21\. In the result, appeal of the Revenue is here by dismissed.
22\. ITA No.4549 for A.Y. 2009-10 & ITA No. 4550/Mum/12-for AY 2010-11 Since
identical issues are involved in these appeals for subsequent years also,
hence in view of our findings given above, these appeals of the revenue are
also here by dismissed.
23\. In the result all the above titled three appeals of the revenue are
hereby dismissed.
24\. Order pronounced on this,23rd October 2013.

ii) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case by

Per Sanjay Garg, Judicial Member:
These three appeals preferred by Revenue are relating to different assessment
years but connected to the same assessee. Since common issues have been raised
in these appeals,hence, these are taken together for disposal with this
consolidated order. The facts for the sake of convenience are taken from the
appeal No.4548/M/12.
ITA No.4548/M/12.(Assessment Year 2008-09)
2\. This appeal has been directed against the order of the CIT(A) dated
30.04.12.The revenue has raised the following grounds of appeal: "1.
          i)      The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case
                                       2                 ITA No-4548./Mum/2012
                                            Sahara One Media & Entertainment Ltd.
                                                                                .
without appreciating the fact that the agreement between the assessee and the
deductee speaks that the copy rights is vested with the producer (in respect
of production charges), which evidences the fact that the agreement is in the
nature of Royalty agreement which attracts the provisions of section 194J of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 for deduction of TDS.
ii) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case by
holding that the dubbing expenses/print processing fees as contract, this work
involves technical expertise which can only be executed by competent persons
in the respective field thus dubbing expenses/pring processing fees attracts
the provisions of section 194J of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for deduction of
TDS.
iii) The ld. CIT(A) has erred in law as well as on the facts of the case by
relying on the decision of ACIT Vs. Manish Dutt (2011) 12 Taxmann. Com 50
