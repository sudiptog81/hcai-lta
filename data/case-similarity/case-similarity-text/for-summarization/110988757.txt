15\. Since the ld.CIT(A) has restricted the disallowance at 12.5% on the basis
of finding recorded in the Asstt.Year 2011-12, but that finding of the
ld.CIT(A) was not upheld by the ITAT, and has scaled down to 2%. Therefore,
respectfully following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench, we allow this
ground of appeal and direct the AO to compute disallowance out of labour
expenses at 25% of the total labour payment made by the assessee. In other
words, it should 2% (two percent) of Rs.1,90,43,133/-. This ground of appeal
is partly allowed.
16\. In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.

    PER RAJPAL YADAV, JUDICIAL MEMBER:
          Assessee is in appeal before the Tribunal against order of ld.CIT(A),
    Gandhinagar dated 23.12.2016 passed for the assessment year 2012-13.
    2.    Grounds of appeal taken by the assessee are not in consonance with
    the Rule 8 of the Income Tax (Appellate Tribunal) Rules, 1963 - they are
    descriptive and argumentative in nature.     In the first fold of grievance, the
    assessee has pleaded that the ld.CIT(A) has erred in confirming the addition
    of Rs.3,74,90,000/- which was made by the AO with help of outcome of
    survey carried out at the premises of the assessee.
                                                                     ITA No.399/Ahd/2017
                                          2
    3.    Brief facts of the case are that survey under section 133A of the Act
    was carried out at the premises of the assessee on 19.10.2011. It has filed its
    return of income on 30.9.2012 electronically declaring taxable income at
    Rs.1,17,21,050/- which was revised on 30.10.2012 declaring total income at
    rs.1,22,22,060/-.   The case of the assessee was selected for scrutiny
    assessment and notice under section 143(2) was issued and served upon the
    assessee. The ld.AO found that during the course of survey statement of Shri
    Nikil Prahladbhai Patel, partner of the assessee-firm was recorded wherein he
    has admitted an undisclosed receipt of Rs.3,74,79,000/-. This disclosure was
    made on the basis of recovery of a diary viz. "Vikram diary" containing pages
    1 to 129 and taken into possession by the survey team as Annexure A. The
    ld.AO has confronted the assessee to show as to how it has not included the
    alleged undisclosed income admitted during the course of survey.              The
    assessee submitted that no such diary was found during the course of survey.
    It has actually been created by the survey team at the early morning hours of
    October 20, 2011. An affidavit dated 20.11.2011 has been submitted to the
    AO to this effect and the affidavit has been reproduced by the AO in para 5.2
    of the assessment order. The ld.AO has made an analysis of this affidavit as
    well as alleged diary and recorded a finding that names from whom money
    has been taken by the assessee are being reflected in the bookings accepted by
    the assessee for sale of shops and residential flats. The assessee has not
    produced any independent evidence indicating as to how this diary was
    created, and what was nature of threat. The ld.AO has also made reference
    about certain procedural defects in the affidavit viz. purchase of stamps,
    attestation etc.    On an analysis of these evidences, the AO has made an
    addition of Rs.3,74,79,000/-. Appeal to the CIT(A) did not bring any relief to
    the assessee.
                                                                     ITA No.399/Ahd/2017
                                          3
    4.    The ld.counsel for the assessee while impugning orders of the Revenue
    authorities raised two fold submissions. In his first fold of contentions, he
    submitted that the statement made during the course of survey under section
    133A, was without administering on oath, and therefore, it does not carry any
    evidentiary value except as a corroborative piece of information for setting
    the machinery of investigation in motion. For buttressing his contentions, he
    relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. S.
    Khader Khan Son, 25 taxmann.com 413 (SC). He relied upon the judgment
    of Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case of Paul Mathews & Sons Vs. CIT
    reported in 263 ITR 101. He placed on record copy of judgment of Hon'ble
    Supreme Court in the case of S. Khader khan (supra) reported in 300 ITR 157.
    With regard to the recovery of diary, he alleged that an affidavit was filed by
    the assessee retracting the statement given at the time of survey and also
    alleged that this diary was created by the Revenue authorities. The ld.counsel
    for the assessee took an alternative plea whereby he contended that the AO
    himself has alleged that amounts reflected in the diary from 84 persons who
    have booked shops/residential flats which were reflected in the list of unit
    holders, therefore, at the most it could be construed as acceptance of on-
    money in cash. It is to be treated as part of total sale consideration and only
    the element of profit involved in such receipts ought to be treated as income
    of the assessee. For buttressing this contention, he relied upon the following
    decisions:
          i)     DCIT Vs. Panna Corporation, Tax Appeal No.323 of 2000 (Guj)
          ii)    CIT Vs. President Industries, 258 IR 654 (Guj)
          iii)   CIT Vs. Balchand Ajit Kumar, 263 ITR 610 (MP)
          iv)    Man Mohan Sadani Vs. CIT, 304 ITR 52 (MP)
                                                                         ITA No.399/Ahd/2017
                                            4
    5.    In order to demonstrate the amount requires to be added back or
    quantification of the profit involved in the alleged on-money, he submitted
    that the assessee-firm has started its business from the Asstt.Year 2011-12 to
    2016-17. The turnover and profit ratio has been compiled in tabular form,
    which has been filed along with synopsis during the course of hearing. He
    made reference to this material. They read as under:
         Asst. Year    Turnover             Profit             Ratio
         2011-12       Rs. 1,62,25, 161/-   Rs.38,35,927/-     23.65%
         2012-13       Rs.5,44,29,724/-     Rs.L28.32.868/-    23.58%
         2013-14       Rs.2,20,87,315/-     Rs.NIL-            --
         2014-15       Rs.80,61,000/-       Rs.38,32,625/-     47.55%
         2015-16       Rs.58,62.000/-       Rs. 15,18,753/ -   25.91%
         2016-17       Rs.58,32,000/-       Rs.7,62,877/-      13.08%
         Total         Rs. 11,24,97,200/-   Rs.7,62,877/-      20.25%
    6.    On the strength of the above, he submitted that addition, if any, requires
    to be made then it should be restricted to Rs.75,89,498/- i.e. [20.25% of
    Rs.3,74,79,000]. This figure has been worked out by the assessee on the basis
    of weighted average of the profit starting from the Asstt.Year 2011-12 upto
    the Asstt.Year 2016-17.
    7.    The ld.DR, on the other hand, relied upon the orders of the Revenue
    authorities, and contended that addition is not based simply on the basis of the
    statement recorded during the course of survey, rather it is based on evidences
    found during the course of survey. Thus, judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
    Court in the case of S. Khaderkan(supra) is not applicable in the present case.
    As far as restriction of addition to the extent of element of profit is concerned,
                                                                      ITA No.399/Ahd/2017
                                           5
    he submitted that this is the receipt which has not been included in the overall
    receipts reflected in the book, though expenditure must have been debited in
    the book. Therefore, total are required to be added.
    8.    We have duly considered rival submissions, and gone through the
    record carefully. As far as the argument of the ld.counsel for the assessee is
    concerned that statement recorded during the course of survey does not carry
    evidentiary value and on the strength of such evidence no addition can be
    made is concerned, we are of the view that in the present case, addition has
    not been solely on the basis of the statement. The addition has been made on
    the cumulative settings of the disclosure made by a partner during the course
    of survey coupled with discovery of a diary containing details of on-money
    received by the assessee from 84 persons. The partner, Shri Nikil Prahladbhai
    Patel though filed an affidavit deposing therein that this diary was prepared
    during the course of survey by the survey-team, but it is to be seen that the
    names of    84 persons are written in this diary, neither the assessee has
    produced any one nor the AO has called for any one, whether they have given
    money in cash to the assessee. If the names reflected in the diary are common
    with ultimate purchasers of the shops/residential flats, then it is difficult to
    construe that the diary was created with fictitious names.    The stand of the
    AO is that head of survey team, Shri Mohan Kumar is a non-Gujarati and it
    was difficult for him to arrange a list of 84 persons in the early hours of the
    morning for incorporating in the diary, if any one of the buyers has not paid
    on-money in cash. Thus, to our mind, evidence of conclusive nature is not
    available either in favour of the allegations made by the assessee or against
    that allegation produced by the AO. Nevertheless, for the purpose of income-
    tax proceedings, we construe that diary was found wherein details of 84
    persons to whom the assessee has ultimately sold shops/residential flats are
    available, who have allegedly given certain money to the assessee in cash.
                                                                       ITA No.399/Ahd/2017
                                           6
    Therefore, as far as evidence found during the course of survey against the
    assessee is concerned, we are satisfied that department is able to lay its hand
    on sufficient evidence which call for making addition on account of on-
    money received by the assessee for sale of flats/shops. The next question is,
    whether gross receipts are to be added or treated at par qua receipts received
    through account payee cheque, in other words, whether addition of total
    amount is to be made or, it is to be confined to the profit element involved in
    this receipt. Before adverting to this aspect, we would like to note the finding
    of the AO that this on-money received by the assessee on sale of flats/shops to
    84 persons whose accounts are reflected in the books, which is recorded in
    page no.24-25 of the order. It reads as under:
          "It is not possible to collect a blank diary at early morning and to prepare
          the name and address of the persons by an outsider officer i.e. Shri
          Mohan Kumar S., who belongs to/non Gujarati and how he can imaging
          the names of the persons which reflected in the diary. Further, the
          names of 84 persons who have booked shops and residential flats,
          which reflected in the list of unit holders provided by the assessee i.e.
          these names are matched with the record, hence, how the assessee
          said these 84 persons as fictitious ? The diary is containing 129 pages,
          which is not possible to make it in one morning hours."
    9.    At this stage, we would like to take note of the finding of the Hon'ble
    Gujarat High Court in the case of DCIT Vs. Panna Corporation where similar
    circumstance arose. The question which was formulated by the Hon'ble High
    Court and relevant part of conclusion made in this case read as under:
          "Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in deleting
          the addition made on account of undisclosed income earned by the
          assessee out of "on money" receipts from the sale of row houses done
          during the block period?"
          5. Learned counsel for the revenue, Shri Sudhir Mehta submitted that
          the Tribunal committed a serious error in reversing the order of the
          Assessing Officer. He submitted that the on money collection by the
          respondent - assessee firm was established. The Tribunal having
ITA No.399/Ahd/2017  7 confirmed such findings, ought not to have rescinded
the directions for collection of tax, interest etc.
6\. On the other hand, learned senior counsel Shri S. N. Soparkar appearing
for the respondent - assessee opposed the appeal contending that no question
of law arises. He drew out attention to section 260- A of the Income Tax Act
to contend that even after admission of the appeal, it would be open for the
assessee to contend that no question of law arises.
7\. He submitted that even if the on money collection of Rs.62 lakhs is
believed, what could be taxed in the hands of the assessee is only the income
and not the entire receipt. He submitted that the Tribunal having accepted
that such income could not exceed Rs.26 lakhs out of total receipt of Rs.62
lakhs, no interference is called for, since estimation of income could not
give rise to any substantial question of law.
8\. In support of his contentions, the counsel relied on several decisions,
reference to which we may make at slightly later stage.
9\. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the
orders under consideration, what emerges is that the findings arrived at by
the Assessing Officer that the respondent - partnership firm received on money
of Rs.62 lakhs during the block period for sale of the flats, is not seriously
in dispute. The Tribunal confirmed such findings arrived at by the Assessing
Officer. However, the Tribunal did not permit the revenue to collect the tax
on the entire receipt believing the it was only the income embedded in such
receipt which can be subjected to tax.
10\. As pointed out by the counsel for the respondent, this Court in the case
of Commissioner of Income Tax v. President Industries, reported in (2002) 258
ITR 654 had taken a similar view. In the said case, during the course of
survey conducted on the premises of the assessee, from the excise records
found, an inference was drawn by the Assessing Officer that sales accounting
to Rs.29 lakhs and odd had not been disclosed in the books of account. The
Assessing Officer made addition of the entire sum of the said undisclosed
sales as income of the assessee for the assessment year 1994-95. Such addition
was confirmed by the Commissioner (Appeals). The Tribunal, however, held that
the entire sales could not have been added as income of the assessee, but only
to the extent the estimated profits embedded in the sales for which the net
ITA No.399/Ahd/2017  8 profit rate was adopted entailing addition of income on
the suppressed amount of sales. Such decision was carried in appeal by the
revenue before the High Court. The High Court rejected the appeal, observing
that unless there is a finding to the effect that investment by way of
incurring the cost in acquiring the goods which have been sold has been made
by the assessee and that has also not been disclosed, such addition could not
be sustained. It was observed that in absence of such findings of fact, the
question whether the entire sum of undisclosed sale proceeds can be treated as
income of the relevant assessment year answers by itself in the negative. The
High Court rejected the appeal holding that no question of law which requires
to be referred arises.
11\. In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. Gurubachhan Singh J. Juneja,
reported in (2008) 302 ITR 63 (Guj.), once again a somewhat similar issue came
up before this Court. In the said case, the assessee was engaged in the
business of trading of tyres. Search proceedings were carried out at the
residential and business premises of the assessee. On the basis of loose
sheets which were seized during such search operation, the Assessing Officer
held that sales to the extent of Rs.10.85 lakhs was not found in the books of
account. Such amount was included in the total income of the assessee. The
Commissioner (Appeals) gave substantial relief to the assessee and reduced the
income on the basis of gross profit rate. The Tribunal confirmed the order of
the Commissioner (Appeals). On further appeal before the High Court by the
revenue, the High Court refused to refer any question holding that in absence
of any material on record to show that there was any unexplained investment
made by the assessee which was reflected by the alleged undisclosed sales, the
finding of the Tribunal that only the gross profit on the said amount can be
brought to tax does not call for any interference.
12\. Counsel also relied on the decision in the case of Commissioner of Income
Tax v. Samir Synthetics Mill, reported in (2010) 326 ITR 410, wherein the High
Court confirmed the view of the Tribunal accepting only the profit of
unaccounted sale for the purpose of collecting tax.
13\. Our attention was also drawn to the decision of the M. P. High Court in
the case of Man Mohan Sadani v. Commissioner of Income Tax, reported in (2008)
304 ITR 52, wherein referring to and relying upon the decision of this Court
in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. President Industries (supra) and
other decisions of other High Courts, the M. P. High Court had also taken a
similar view. It was ITA No.399/Ahd/2017  9 observed that entire sale proceeds
of the assessee should not be added in his income and that the Tribunal has
erred in doing so."
10\. Other decisions referred by the ld.counsel for the assessee are also to
similar facts. Therefore, we are of the view that only element of profit
embedded in these receipts are required to be treated as unaccounted income.
For quantifying that, at the cost of repetition, we would like to note of
profit ratio shown by the assessee in different years, which reads as under:
          Asst. Year   Turnover             Profit             Ratio
          2011-12      Rs. 1,62,25, 161/-   Rs.38,35,927/-     23.65%
          2012-13      Rs.5,44,29,724/-     Rs.L28.32.868/-    23.58%
          2013-14      Rs.2,20,87,315/-     Rs.NIL-            --
          2014-15      Rs.80,61,000/-       Rs.38,32,625/-     47.55%
          2015-16      Rs.58,62.000/-       Rs. 15,18,753/ -   25.91%
          2016-17      Rs.58,32,000/-       Rs.7,62,877/-      13.08%
          Total        Rs. 11,24,97,200/-   Rs.7,62,877/-      20.25%
11\. A perusal of the above would indicate that weighted average of profit is
20.25%, which is reasonable one. Therefore, we direct the AO to restrict the
assessment of income on this issue at Rs.75,89,498/- as against the addition
of Rs.3,74,79,000/-. This ground of appeal is partly allowed.
12\. In the next fold of grievance, the assessee has pleaded that the
ld.CIT(A) has erred in confirming the addition of Rs.23,80,391/- out of total
labour expenses.
13\. Brief facts of the case are that the assessee has debited labour
expenditure at Rs.1,90,43,133/-. The ld.AO has disallowed 50% of the total ITA
No.399/Ahd/2017  10 labour expenses and made an addition of Rs.95,21,567/-.
The ld.CIT(A) has restricted this disallowance to 12.50% i.e. confirmed an
addition of Rs.23,80,391/-. This addition was confirmed by the ld.CIT (A) on
the basis of finding recorded by his predecessor in earlier years, where
similar addition was made. The ld.counsel for the assessee at the very outset
submitted in the Asstt.Year 2011-12 this issued travelled to the Tribunal in
ITA No.1767/Ahd/2015 wherein the Tribunal has confirmed the disallowance to 2%
of the total expenditure. Thus, he contended that the issue in dispute is
squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the decision of the Tribunal in
the Asstt.Year 2011-12. The ld.CIT(A) has followed the decision of his
predecessor in the Asstt.Year 2011-12 and that disallowance has been further
scaled down by the Tribunal. The ld.DR was unable to controvert this
contention of the ld.counsel for the assessee.
14\. We find that there is no disparity on facts. All the details have been
considered by the Tribunal in its order for the Asstt.Year 2011-12. The
relevant finding of the Tribunal reads as under:
> "6. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
> on record. In the instant case, the labor expenses incurred by the assessee
> was disallowed by the AO on the ground that the labor expenses were bogus.
> How the ld CIT(A) reduced the disallowance made by the AO to the tune of 5%
> of the total labor expenses. Now the issue before us arises whether the
> expenses incurred by the assessee represents the bogus expenses in the given
> facts and circumstances. In this regard, we note that the assessee has

15\. Since the ld.CIT(A) has restricted the disallowance at 12.5% on the basis
of finding recorded in the Asstt.Year 2011-12, but that finding of the

respectfully following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench, we allow this
ground of appeal and direct the AO to compute disallowance out of labour
expenses at 25% of the total labour payment made by the assessee. In other
