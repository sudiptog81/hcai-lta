Besides this, in the said decision, the Court reached to specific conclusion
and finding that the plaintiff had furnished false declaration and both the
suits were based on same cause of action and the case suffered from
suppression of material facts and the plaintiff did not approach the Court
with clean hands. Thus, the said  77 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT decision also
does not render any assistance to the petitioners in light of the facts of
second suit.
26\. In this view of the matter, the conclusion reached by the learned trial
Court cannot be faulted and the impugned order does not warrant interference.
The petitioner has failed to make out any ground or justification to convince
the Court to set aside the impugned order. Therefore, the petition fails and
deserves to be rejected and is accordingly rejected. Notice is discharged.

HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE K.M.THAKER Date : 28/08/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
1\. In present petition, the petitioners have prayed,  1 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT inter alia, that:
> "10(A) This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue an appropriate writ, order
> and/or direction, quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated
> 25.11.2013 passed by the Ld. 6th Additional District & Sessions Judge,
> Jamnagar below application Ex.15 in Regular Civil Suit No.65/2012, and be
> further pleased to reject plaint of Regular Civil Suit No.65/2012 filed by
> the Respondent in the Court of Ld. 6th Additional District & Sessions Judge,
> Jamnagar."
2\. The petitioners are aggrieved by order dated 25.11.2013 passed by the
learned trial Court below Exh.15 in Regular Civil Suit No.65 of 2012 whereby
the learned trial Court rejected present petitioners' (i.e. original
defendants) application (Exh.15) which was filed under Order VII Rule 11 (a)
and (d) of the Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code').
3\. The relevant facts involved in and leading to present petition are that:
3.1 The petitioners are the original defendants and the respondent herein is
the original plaintiff in Regular Civil Suit No.65 of 2012.
3.2 According to the details mentioned in the  2 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
petition, the petitioner No.1 is a partnership firm which is engaged in the
business of processing and selling edible lime ordinarily used in pan masala
and/or with beetle nut and tobacco.
3.3 The petitioners claim that they are selling their product under different
brand names viz. Babu, New Patel and Shree Bhole Bapa Parcel. The petitioners
have further claimed that since 2006 they adopted, and started to use the mark
'Babu Chuna' and 'Babu Parcel' on the packaging of edible lime and that during
the same time they also started using another mark viz. 'New Patel Parcel
Chuna' and 'Shree Bhole Bapa Parcel' hereinafter referred to as 'Bhole Bapa').
3.4 The petitioners have claimed that in July 2012, the respondents herein
filed a civil suit which came to be registered as Regular Civil Suit No.4 of
2012 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said first suit') at Rajkot against the
petitioners on the allegation of (a) infringement of copyright; and (b)
passing off. The respondents also filed  3 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
application for injunction / interim relief (Exh.5) whereon the learned Court
issued notice to the petitioners. 3.5 It is claimed by the petitioners that
they have obtained assignment of the trademark 'Babu Chuna' from one Mrs. S.
Sayali and for that purpose a deed of assignment dated 7.8.2012 (i.e. after
the respondents filed the said first suit No.4 of 2012) has been executed
between said Mrs. S. Sayali and the petitioners. 3.6 The petitioners have also
claimed that they filed objections against the maintainability of the said
first suit (i.e. RCS No.4 of 2012).
3.7 According to the petitioners, the respondents tendered a purshis (Exh.16)
in the said first suit declaring that the said suit and the injunction
application is only for infringement of copyright and accordingly he (i.e. the
plaintiff) will delete the averments of passing off in the plaint and
injunction application and will submit amended plaint and injunction
application.
4 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
3.8 The petitioners have also claimed that in September 2012, they have filed
a suit for infringement of trademark against present respondent which is
registered as Regular Civil Suit No.7 of 2012.
3.9 The petitioners have alleged that during the pendency of the said first
suit, the respondent filed another suit at Jamnagar which is registered as
Regular Civil Suit No.65 of 2012 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said second
suit').
3.10 In this background, the petitioners herein filed an application (i.e.
Exh.15) dated 19.1.2013 in the said second suit and claimed that the said
second suit is not maintainable in light of Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d).
After hearing the parties with reference to the said application (Exh.15), the
learned trial Court passed the order dated 25.11.2013 and rejected the said
application for the reasons recorded in the order. Hence present petition.
4\. Mr. Mehta, learned senior counsel submitted that after having withdrawn
the averments and the  5 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT claim/relief with
reference to alleged 'passing off' and after declaring that the relief prayed
for in the suit No.4/2012 is to be restricted to the claim/relief against
alleged infringement of copyright, it is not permissible to the plaintiff
(i.e. present respondent) to file another suit for similar claim/relief,
however, the plaintiff in the said first suit has filed second suit for same
claim/relief. According to the learned senior counsel for the petitioners, any
permission from the Court to file second suit for same claim/relief was
neither prayed for nor granted and therefore also the said second suit (RCS
No.65/2012) is not maintainable. He also submitted that the said second suit
is a composite suit and that, therefore also, the said second suit is barred
by law. Mr. Mehta relied on the provisions under Order 23 Rule 1(4) and Order
2 Rule 2 of the Code and Section 27 read with Sections 135, 28 and 29 of the
Trademarks Act. Mr. Mehta submited that in light of the said provisions the
plaint/suit deserve to be rejected under Rule 11 (a) and (d) of Order 7 and
the application filed by the petitioners ought to have been allowed however
the learned trial Court failed to  6 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT appreciate
the said contentions and erred in rejecting the application. According to
Mr.Mehta, learned senior counsel, the impugned order suffers from serious
error of non-application of mind and that the impugned order is a non-speaking
and unreasoned order and that the second suit deserves to be and ought to have
been rejected. In support of his submissions, Mr. Mehta relied on below
mentioned decisions:

4.1 Per contra, Mr. Shah, learned counsel for Mr. Raval, learned advocate for
the respondent opposed the petition and the submissions by Mr. Mehta and
submitted that the subsequent suit filed by present respondent is neither
barred by Order 2 Rule 2 nor by Order 23 Rule 1(4). Mr. Shah also disputed the
contention that the second suit is a composite suit or that it is hit by
section 27 of the Act. Mr. Shah submitted that the first suit is filed with
reference to and in light of the mark 'Bhole Bapa'. He also submitted that the
relief prayed for / claim in the first suit is against alleged infringement of
copyright in artistic work of plaintiff's label and the relief / claim against
passing off are raised with reference to mark 'Bhole Bapa', whereas the second
suit is against and in respect of alleged passing off by using mark 'Babu'.  8
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT According to learned advocate for the respondent,
the said two suits are based on different subject matter and separate cause of
action. According to the respondent, the provisions under Order 2 Rule 2
and/or Order 23 Rule 1(4) are not attracted in respect of the said second suit
and the suit is not barred by the said provisions. Mr. Shah, learned advocate
for the respondent also contended that the application under Order 7 Rule 11
is based on defence and their contention amounts to going into the defence of
the defendants. Mr.Shah, learned advocate for the respondent also claimed that
in a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, the Court would interfere
with the order of the learned trial Court only if the reasons are perverse,
however, in present case, the reasons recorded by the learned trial Court are
not perverse and therefore, the order does not deserve to be and may not be
interfered. Mr.Shah, learned counsel relied on following decisions:
> (a) Alka Gupta vs. Narender Kumar Gupta [AIR 2011 SC 9];
> (b) Oriental Bank of Commerce vs. Naresh Khushaldas Gangtani [AIR 2007
> Gujarat 172];

    5.1          Meaning          thereby,          even       after    filing    above
    mentioned        purshis           dated        9.11.2012      (Exh.16),           until

6\. I have heard learned counsel for the contesting parties and also
considered the material on record including the plaint in said three suits and
the impugned order as well as the decisions relied on by learned advocates.
Re: Order 7 Rule 11:
7\. It is trite that for deciding an application invoking Order VII Rule 11
(a) and (d) averments only in the plaint can be taken into account and the
plea/defence raised by the defendant cannot and should not be taken into
account. Moreover the plaint must be read as a whole and not in bits and
pieces. The pleadings should be  12 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT read without
addition or substraction of any words and the applicant / defendant cannot
selectively pick-up some sentence or passage and read it out of context. It is
also pertinent that at the stage of considering an application under Order 7
Rule 11, the learned trial Court is not supposed to examine and test the
substance and merits of the allegations and/or to decide as to whether there
is enough evidence whereby the plaintiff can prove its claim and the
allegations and whether the plaintiff will succeed in the suit or not. The
allegations by the plaintiff are matter of proof and evidence. At this stage,
the learned trial Court would only examine as to whether the plaint contains
appropriate and necessary averments which make out cause of action or not.
8\. On this count it would be appropriate to take into consideration following
observations by Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision in case between T.
Arivandandam vs. T.V. Satyapal [(1977) 4 SCC 467]:
> "... ... ... if on a meaningful - not formal - reading of the plaint it is
> manifestly vexatious and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear
> right to sue issued exercise his power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. ..."
13 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
which explain the circumstances in which the power under Order 7 Rule 11
should be exercised.
8.1 Thereafter, in the decision in case between Reptacos Breh and Co. Ltd. vs.
Ganesh Property [(1998) 7 SCC 184], Hon'ble Apex Court observed that the
averments in the plaint as a whole have to be seen to find out whether clause
(d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 was applicable.
8.2 Subsequently in the decision in case between Saleem Bhai vs. State of
Maharashtra [(2003) 1 SCC 557], Hon'ble Apex Court explained and clarified
that the power under said provision can be exercised at any stage of the
proceedings, Hon'ble Apex Court observed, inter alia, that:
> "9. A perusal of Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. makes it clear that the relevant
> facts which need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder
> are the averments in the plaint. The trial court can exercise the power
> under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. at any stage of the suit-before registering
> the plaint or after issuing summons to the defendant at any time before the
> conclusion of the trial. For the purposes of deciding an application under
> clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order VII C.P.C. the averments in the
> plaint are germane; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written
> statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage, ..."
8.3 In the decision in case between Mayar (H.K.)  14 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT Ltd. vs. Owners & Parties, Vessel M.V. Fortune Express [(2006) 3 SCC
100], Hon'ble Apex Court explained the position with regard to Order 7 Rule 11
by following observations:
> "12. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that the plaint cannot be rejected
> on the basis of the allegations made by the defendant in his written
> statement or in an application for rejection of the plaint. The Court has to
> read the entire plaint as a whole to find out whether it discloses a cause
> of action and if it does, then the plaint cannot be rejected by the Court
> exercising the powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Essentially,
> whether the plaint discloses a cause of action, is a question of fact which
> has to be gathered on the basis of the averments made in the plaint in its
> entirety taking those averments to be correct. A cause of action is a bundle
> of facts which are required to be proved for obtaining relief and for the
> said purpose, the material facts are required to be stated but not the
> evidence except in certain cases where the pleadings relied on are in regard
> to misrepresentation, fraud, wilful default, undue influence or of the same
> nature. So long as the plaint discloses some cause of action which requires
> determination by the court, mere fact that in the opinion of the Judge the
> plaintiff may not succeed cannot be a ground for rejection of the plaint. In
> the present case, the averments made in the plaint, as has been noticed by
> us, do disclose the cause of action and, therefore, the High Court has
> rightly said that the powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code cannot be
> exercised for rejection of the suit filed by the plaintiff-appellants."
> 8.4 The issue related to limitation came up for consideration in the
> decision in the case between C.
Natrajan vs. Ashim Bai [(2007) 14 SCC 183], and Hon'ble Apex Court observed
that:
> "8. An application for rejection of the plaint can be filed if the
> allegations made in the plaint even if given face value and taken to be
> correct in their entirety appear to be barred by any law. The question as to
> whether a suit is barred by limitation or not would, therefore, depend upon
> the facts and circumstances of each case. For the said purpose, only the

> 9\. Applicability of one or the other provision of the Limitation Act per se

> C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT as to whether the suit is barred under one or

    8.5           Recently, in the decision in case between
    Church      of     Christ     Charitable         Trust      and      Educational
    Charitable       Society      represented           by its Chairman                vs.

> "... It is clear from the above that where the plaint does not disclose a

> 8.6 Likewise, in the decision in case between Bhau Ram vs. Janak Singh [AIR

16 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
> "8. The law has been settled by this Court in various decisions that while

> 8.7 The expression 'the plaint should be read as a whole' is further

Kotecha Property vs. State Bank of India Staff Association [(2005) 7 SCC 510]:
> "19. There cannot be any compartmentalization, dissection, segregation and

Although it is the substance and not merely the form that has to be looked
into, the pleading has to be construed as it stands without addition or
subtraction of words or change of its apparent grammatical sense. The
intention of the party concerned is to be gathered primarily from the tenor
and terms of his pleadings taken as a whole. At the same time it should be
borne in mind that no pedantic approach should be adopted to defeat justice on
hair-splitting technicalities." (Emphasis supplied) 8.8 Thus, in the matters
under Order 7 Rule 11, the plea/defence by the defendant is a foreign
territory, wherein the Court should not enter and travel.
Re: Order 7 Rule 11(a):
9\. So as to invoke Rule 11(a), the learned senior counsel for the petitioners
claimed that (i) the plaint does  17 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT not disclose
any cause of action; and (ii) any ingredients for passing off. For examining
the said objections, the plaint of the said second suit is required to be
examined keeping in focus the above-mentioned principles and guidelines laid
down by Hon'ble Apex Court.
9.1 When the averments and allegations in the plaint of the said second suit
are examined (relevant part of the said second suit is reproduced in the later
part of this judgment), it emerges that the plaintiff has claimed that on
account of the acts of the defendant and in light of the provisions under the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 coupled with its position and status as user of the mark
'Babu' certain rights have accrued in its favour and the suit claim is based
on the assertion that he is 'prior user' of the trademark 'Babu' which enjoys
'established goodwill and reputation' and that the acts of the defendants
amount to passing off and the acts of the defendants have caused and it will
cause loss and damages. There are sufficient and specific averments in the
plaint which clearly spell out the cause of action which led the plaintiff to
institute the  18 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT said second suit against alleged
passing off by using mark 'Babu'. Thus, in this case it cannot be said that
the plaintiff has failed to make out cause of action. The petitioners'
contention is not sustainable.
10\. Now so far as the allegation that the plaint does not make out any
ingredients of passing off, is concerned, it is appropriate to take into
account the elements for maintaining action of passing off. The acknowledged
and essential elements are viz. (a) reputation of goods; (b) possibility of
deception; (c) likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. The averments in the
plaint must reflect the said elements. In addition to the said essential
elements there are certain other characteristics related to the action of
'passing off' viz. degree of resemblance, nature of goods, similarity in
nature and character of goods, class of purchasers, the span/period for which
the plaintiff is associated with the mark/goods.
10.1 On this count, it emerges from the plaint of second suit that the
plaintiff has claimed that due to its  19 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT very
good quality his goods command and enjoy great popularity and has significant
presence and his trade name / trade mark 'Babu' has acquired rich and high
goodwill and that the defendants are selling their products by using mark
'Babu' which is identical and deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade
name / trade mark 'Babu' and thereby the defendants are 'passing off' their
goods as that of the plaintiff's and that he has proprietary interest in the
goodwill and that it is likely to be damaged due to misrepresentations by the
defendants (i.e. the petitioners). It comes out clearly that the plaint
contains proper and sufficient, basic and necessary averments and assertions
so as to demonstrate presence of the requisite elements to maintain action
against alleged passing off. Thus, second limb of the objection is also not
established by the petitioners and it fails.
11\. In this view of the matter, the above-
mentioned objection, i.e. objection at Sr.No.(i) and (ii) above are not
sustainable. Once it is found that the above- mentioned objections against the
plaint of the said second  20 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT suit are not
sustainable, then as corollary the objection in light of Rule 11(a) of Order
VII fails.
12\. So as to invoke Rule 11(d) the learned senior counsel for the petitioners
claimed that (iii) the said second suit is barred by law since (a) it is not
maintainable in light of Order 2 Rule 2; and (b) it is not maintainable in
light of Order 23 Rule 1(4); and (iv) the said second suit is not maintainable
because it is a composite suit and also because it is hit by section 27 of the
Act because the plaintiff has claimed (a) relief against passing off and
copyright; and (b) also because the plaintiff has prayed for damages as well
as accounts of profit along with prayer for injunction.
13\. For sake of convenience, the contention at Sr.No.(iv) viz. second suit is
a composite suit therefore it is not maintainable, may be considered before
taking-up the contention at Sr.No.(iii).
Re: Composite suit:
14\. On the said count the learned senior counsel Mr.  21 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT Mehta submitted that in the said second suit the plaintiff has
claimed relief against alleged passing off as well as against alleged breach
of copyright and also claimed damages and accounts of profit therefore the
said second suit is not maintainable and to support first limb of said
submission, he relied on the decision dated 7.3.2012 in Letters Patent Appeal
No.877 of 2010, wherein the Division Bench relied on the decisions in the case
of M/s. Dhodha House vs. S.K. Mangi [AIR 2006 SC 730] and in the case of Dabur
India Ltd. vs. K.R. Industries [(2008) 10 SCC 595] and observed, inter alia,
that:
> "7. In view of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, since

> and distinct cause of action, therefore, separate suits were required to be
> filed under the aforesaid Acts and composite suit would not be maintainable
> in view of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
> of Dabur India (supra)."
14.1 The question which, therefore, arises is whether in his second suit the
plaintiff has prayed for the said two relief/s or only against alleged
'passing off'. 14.2 In this context, it is pertinent that though the plaint
should be read as a whole and few paragraphs or few sentences cannot be
conveniently picked up and  22 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT cannot be read out
of context or in isolation, the plaintiff has picked up two paragraphs, or
rather few sentences from two paragraphs viz. paragraphs No.5 and 7 of the
plaint and they are sought to be read out of context so as to justify the said
contention. The sentences from paragraphs No.5 and 7 which are picked up by
the defendants, read thus:
> "5. The plaintiff further submits that the plaintiff is using the said trade
> mark BABU represented in an artistic manner and to avail statutory
> protection for its artistic work, applied under the Copyright Act, 1957 on
> 3.6.2010 and Hon'ble Registrar of Copyright was pleased to register the said
> label. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to statutory protection of the
> same...."
> "7. ... ... ... It is further submitted that the defendant has not only
> adopted the word BABU but the defendant has also imitated the artistic work
> of the label and colour scheme of the plaintiff...."
14.3 On plain reading of the plaint, it emerges that the relief prayed for as
well as the cause of action and the subject-matter in the said second suit are
alleged acts of 'passing off' only and not infringement of copyright. In this
context it is pertinent that the defendants have conveniently overlooked the
relevant parts of said para 7, which read thus:
> "7. The plaintiff came to know from the market source that the defendant is
> selling its products lime under trademark "BABU", which is identical and
> deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark "BABU"......"
23 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
> Likewise the defendants have also ignored the later part of said para 7 of
> second suit which reads thus:
> "It is further submitted that the defendant has not only adopted the word

> Re: Sections 27, 28 and 135 of the Act:
15.1 Section 28 provides, inter alia, that registration of trademark (i.e. a
registered trademark) confers certain rights on the proprietor of a trademark
which is duly registered in manner prescribed by the Act and section 27(1)
provides, inter alia, that no infringement action will lie in respect of an
unregistered trademark. Thus, any proceedings to prevent infringement of
unregistered trademark or to recover damages on account of infringement of
unregistered trademark is not maintainable.
25 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT 15.2 Sub-section (2) of section 27 carves out
an exception by recognizing common law right and it provides, inter alia, that
the restriction prescribed by virtue of sub-section (1) of section 27 would
not affect the right to institute and maintain action for 'passing off'. 15.3
Section 135 of the Act provides, inter alia, that in the suit for 'passing off
the plaintiff may seek, and the Court may grant, relief of (a) injunction
(subject to such conditions as the Court may consider appropriate) and either
the relief for (b) damages or account of profits at the option of the
plaintiff.
15.4 It emerges from plain reading of the said provision that the Court cannot
grant both reliefs (i.e. the damages as well as account of profits). According
to section 135 the plaintiff cannot have both the reliefs but can have either
one of them, and that too, at his option. When neither of the two reliefs
(i.e. the reliefs prayed for in the suit) are barred by law and the Court is
competent to grant either of the said two reliefs, then merely because  26
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT the plaintiff, while seeking injunction against
alleged passing off, mentions both claims in the plaint then entire suit will
not be rendered unsustainable and/or liable for rejection under Order 7 Rule
11(d). Such position and construction of said provisions, if accepted, will
render section 135 meaningless and ineffective or otiose and the plaintiff's
right to elect one of the two claims will stand negated.
15.5 In this context, it is necessary to keep in focus that the right of
option allowed by law is a substantive right and not a mere formality and
that, therefore, it has to be meaningful. A plaintiff cannot be asked or
compelled to, and is not even expected or supposed to speculate completely in
dark as to the quantum and/or mode. Thus, such right would also enjoin further
right viz. to make informed decision. Obviously, such informed decision can be
taken only if sufficient material is available. In this context, it would be
appropriate to take into account below quoted passage from Kerly's Law Trade
Marks and Trade names:
27 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
> "Damages are a matter of right; the account of profits is an equitable
> remedy and the court has a discretion whether or not to grant it.
> Accordingly, a successful claimant in an infringement action is entitled to

> not entitled to all the disclosure which would be given in the inquiry, and
> in appropriate circumstances an audited schedule of infringing dealings may
> be a substitute for documentary disclosure."
15.6 In this view of the matter, ordinarily, a plaintiff who initiates action
against passing off, would, initially (i.e. in the plaint) incorporate both
the claims and can exercise the option at appropriate stage. The question
which, therefore, would arise is about the stage at which the plaintiff should
exercise the option and declare the selection.
15.7 So as to have sufficient material and relevant  28 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT details before him, in light of which he may take informed decision
and accordingly exercise option the plaintiff may defer such election until
the defendant enters the proceedings and then the plaintiff may seek
information in accordance with the provisions of the Code or may defer such
election and await the stage of evidence and exercise his option after the
stage of evidence, however, before conclusion of the final hearing. This view
is supported by the observations by Chancery Division in case of Island
Records Ltd. vs. Tring International plc and other [(1995) 3 ALL ER 444],
which laid down four principles which, by now, are recognised and are well
settled. The relevant part of the decision reads thus:
> "Four principles are clear. First, whilst a plaintiff can apply in
> proceedings in the alternative for damages and an account of profits, he
> cannot obtain judgment for both: he can only obtain judgment for one or the
> other (see Neilson v Betts (1871) LR 5 HL 1 and De Vitre v Betts (1873) LR 6
> HL 319 at 321). Second, once judgment has been entered either for damages or
> an account of profits, any right of election is lost: any claim to the
> remedy other than that for which judgment is entered is forever lost (see
> United Australia Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1940 4 All ER 20 at 38, [1941] AC
> 1 at 30). Third, a party should in general not be required to elect or be
> found to have elected between remedies unless and until he is able to make
> an informed choice. A right of election, if it is to be meaningful and not a
> mere gamble, must embrace the right to readily available information as to
> his likely entitlement in case of both the two alternative remedies. It is
> quite unreasonable to require the plaintiff to speculate totally in the dark
> as to whether or not the sum recoverable by way of damages will exceed that
> recoverable under an account of profits. In an analogous situation, it has

> of copyright before he has been afforded inspection of the records of sales
> in the defendant's books (see Mate & Son v Samuel Stephen Ltd [1928- 35]
> Macg CC 257 at 261). Fourth, the exercise of the right of election  29
> C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT should not be unreasonably delayed to the
> prejudice of the defendant."
15.8 A profitable reference may also be made to the decision in case of James
Neilson vs. William Betts, wherein it is observed, inter alia, that:
> "My Lords, I have only farther to observe that the decree of the Court below
> directed not only an inquiry as to damages, but also an account of profits.
> The two things are hardly reconcilable, for if you take an account of
> profits you condone the infringement. I therefore think, my Lords, that we

> The motion will be that the decree of the Vice-chancellor be varied by

> with costs.
Decrees appealed from varied in one respect, and, subject thereto, the decrees
and orders appealed from affirmed; and appeal dismissed with costs." (Emphasis
supplied) 15.9 In the case of Lever vs. Goodwin [1887 (36) Ch. D. 1 : 4 L.R.
1], Appeal Court (Chancery Division) observed, inter alia, that:
> "... ... ... ... ... It is well known that, both in trade-mark cases and
> patent cases, the plaintiff is entitled, if he succeeds in getting an
> injunction, to take either of two forms of relief; he may either say, "I
> claim from you the damage I have sustained from your wrongful act," or "I

> Plaintiffs by selling the soap of the Defendants as the soap of the
> Plaintiffs.
> In my opinion, therefore, the account of profits is right as it stands."
(Emphasis supplied) 15.10 It follows that inclusion of both the claims in the
plaint does not render the entire suit bad in law and the plaintiff has right
to exercise option during the proceedings. Thus, the objection raised in light
of section 27 of the Act is not sustainable and is not accepted. On such
ground entire suit cannot be rejected under Rule 11 of Order 7 of the Code.
Hence, the contention mentioned at Sr.No.(iv)(b) fails.
Re: Order 2 Rule 2:
16\. Now the objection raised in light of Order 2 Rule 2 and Order 23 Rule 1
may be considered. The said provision aims at discouraging multiple suits and
eliminating harassment with multiple suits for same cause of action. On this
count it would be profitable to take into  31 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
account certain decisions and judicial pronouncements. In case of (a) Gurbux

16.2 Since the thrust is on the identity and unity of 'cause of action' it
would be appropriate to consider at this  37 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT stage
the said expression 'cause of action'. The cause of action, as is well
settled, means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff to prove,
if traversed in order to support his claim for the judgment. The causes of
action in the two suits may be considered to be the same if in substance they
are identical and the evidence required to be led is similar or identical. In
this context, profitable reference may be made to Halsbury's Laws of England,
wherein with reference to the said expression 'cause of action', it is stated
thus:
> "'Cause of action' has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation
> existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy
> against another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest time to
> include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff
> to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse.
> 'Cause of action' has also been taken to mean that particular action on the
> part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or
> the subject-matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the
> technical cause of action."
16.3 In this context, Privy Council, in the case of Mohmmad Khalik Khan vs.
Ali Mian [(1948) 75 Ind App 121] culled out following principles:
> "The principles laid down in the cases thus far discussed may be thus
> summarized : (1) the correct test in cases falling under Order 2 Rule 2 is
> "whether the claim in the new suit is, in fact, founded on a cause of action
> distinct from that which was the foundation for the former suit, (Moonshee
> Buzloor Ruheen V. Shumsoonissa Begum, (1867)11 Moo Ind App 551 (605). The
> cause of action means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff
> to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment (Read
> v. Brown, (1889) 22 QBD 128, 131). If the evidence to support the two claims
> is different then the causes of action are also different (Brunsden v.
> Humphrey, (1884) 14BD141). The causes  38 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT of
> action in the two suits may be considered to be the same if in substance
> they are identical (Brunsden v. Humphrey). The cause of action has no
> relation whatsoever to the defence that may be set up by the defendant, nor
> does it depend on the character of the relief prayed for by the defendant,
> nor does it depend on the character of the relief prayed for by the
> plaintiff." (Emphasis supplied) 16.4 Now, before taking in hands the plaints
> of the said two suits for examining them in juxta-position, it would be
> appropriate to recall that after present respondent filed the said first
> suit No.4/2012 (but before the respondent filed the said second suit, i.e.
> RCS No.65/2012 on 3.11.2012), the petitioners herein (i.e.
defendants in the first suit No.4/2012) filed (on 15.9.2012) a suit against
present respondent (i.e. against plaintiff of the said first suit No.4/2012),
which came to be registered as Regular Civil Suit No.7/2012.
16.5 In the said RCS No.7/2012, the petitioners have expressly and
specifically mentioned and described the claim / relief and the subject-matter
of the said suit, i.e. RCS No.4/2012.
16.6 In this view of the matter, what could be better medium than the
petitioners' own suit and petitioner's  39 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT own
description of (and admission regarding) the subject- matter of present
respondent's first suit (i.e. RCS No.4/2012) to examine petitioner's said
objection raised on the allegation that cause of action in both suits is the
same.
16.7 In paragraphs No.15 and 19 of their suit No.7/2012 the petitioners herein
(i.e. the defendants) themselves have thus described the subject-matter of
respondent's said first suit No.4/2012:
> "15. The plaintiffs say and submit that the plaintiffs shocked and surprised
> much when the defendant herein filed a false and frivolous suit being Civil
> Suit No.4 of 2012 in the Court of Hon'ble 11 th Addl. District Judge, Rajkot
> for the alleged infringement of copyright and passing off against the use of
> the trade mark and packaging of SHREE BHOLE BAPA PARCEL of the present
> plaintiffs.
19\. ... ... ... the defendant hurriedly and intentionally filed the aforesaid
false and frivolous suit against the use of the trade mark label and packaging
of SHREE BHOLE BAPA PARCEL for which otherwise also the defendant was having
no cause of action."(Emphasis supplied) 16.8 From the said averments by the
petitioners in their own suit No.7/2012, it becomes clear that even the
petitioners (i.e. the defendants in the said first suit) have, after proper
examination, noticed that the cause of action in the said first suit is
alleged infringement of copyright and passing off against the use of trade
name and label  40 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT and packaging 'Bhole Bapa' and
not against any other packaging or trade name / trade mark being used by the
petitioners.
16.9 This aspect also becomes clear from the further observations by the
learned Court in the said order dated 31.12.2013 where the learned Court has
recorded that:
> "26. The plaintiff has filed this suit on 15.9.2012. It is also the case of
> plaintiff that the plaintiff came to know about illegal act of the defendant
> only in the first week of August, 2012 when the plaintiff received summons
> and notice of suit filed by defendant against the plaintiff's trade mark
> Shri Bhole Bapa Parcel. ... ..." (Emphasis supplied) 16.10 In paragraph No.5
> of the said order below Exh.5 in aforesaid RCS No.7/2012, the Court has also
> recorded and observed that:
> "5. It is the say of plaintiff that the defendant herein filed CIVIL SUIT
> No.4 of 2012 in the District Court, Rajkot against the plaintiff herein for
> alleged infringement of copyright and passing off against the use of the
> trade mark and packaging of SHREE BHOLE BAPA PARCEL. It is the say of
> plaintiff that the said suit filed by defendant herein is false, frivolous
> and vexatious and it is filed with malafide intention to hide the wrong done
> by defendants." (Emphasis supplied) 16.11 Thus, from the averments in their
> own suit it becomes clear that even the petitioners have understood and
> perceived the said first suit No.4/2012 as an action (against alleged
> infringement of copyright as well as alleged passing off) in respect of and
> against label and  41 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT packaging which carries
> mark 'Bhole Bapa' (and not the mark 'Babu').
> 17\. Despite such clear and specific description of respondent's said first
> suit by the petitioners in their own suit, the petitioners, now (i.e. while
> pursuing their subject application (Exh.15) under Order VII Rule 11) claim
> that the said second suit is for the same claim and same cause of action as
> in the first suit.
17.1 On examination and comparison of the plaints in the said two suits and
after taking into account the purshis Exh.16 and also on taking into account
the claim/relief which the plaintiff is said to have relinquished from the
first suit, it emerges that the cause of action, the claim/relief prayed for
and the subject-matter in the said first suit and second suit are different
and the claim/relief and cause of action and the subject-matter in the second
suit is not the same as the claim/relief and cause of action and subject-
matter in the first suit.
18\. So as to invoke the provision under Order 2 Rule  42 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT 2 the petitioners have also alleged that the first suit in its
original form (i.e. when the plaint was submitted) was a composite suit (i.e.
as an action against alleged infringement of copyright and alleged passing
off) and subsequently the plaintiff submitted the purshis Exh.16 whereby the
plaintiff abandoned a part of the cause of action and the claim and the second
suit is filed for same claim and cause of action.
18.1 However, on this count what is relevant is the vital fact that even in
the original form of the said first suit both the actions/claims (i.e. the
action against alleged infringement of copyright and the action/claim against
passing off) were with reference to and in connection with trade mark / trade
name 'Bhole Bapa'. Thus, when the plaintiff (present respondent) filed the
purshis (Exh.16) declaring that the claim / reliefs with regard to 'passing
off' will be deleted, then, obviously, it would relate to the said trade mark
/ trade 'Bhole Bapa'.
18.2 On this count it is also relevant to note that  43 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT according to their own claim the petitioners carry on business under
various names / marks e.g. New Patel, Shree Bhole Bapa Parcel, Babu Parcel,
Babu Chuna, New Patel Parcel Chuna, etc. What is, however, relevant is that
said first suit is not filed with reference to and in connection with all of
those trade names / trade marks under which the petitioners carry on their
business but the said first suit is filed in connection with only one trade
name / trade mark, i.e. 'Bhole Bapa'. In the plaint of their own suit (RCS
No.7/2012) the petitioners themselves have mentioned that:
> "... ... ... ... ... the defendant herein filed a false and frivolous suit
> being Civil Suit No.4 of 2012 in the Court of Hon'ble 11th Addl. District
> Judge, Rajkot for the alleged infringement of copyright and passing off
> against the use of the trade mark and packaging of SHREE BHOLE BAPA PARCEL
> of the present plaintiff. ..."
> 18.3 Thus, in their own suit the petitioners themselves have expressly
> acknowledged, admitted and mentioned that the use of 'Bhole Bapa' is the
> cause of action for the claim against copyright as well as passing off.
18.4 Thus, when the cause of action and subject-  44 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT matter of the said first suit is only with reference to mark 'Bhole
Bapa', then the purshis, i.e. declaration in the purshis Exh.16 would relate
only to the said mark Bhole Bapa. Hence, the claim/relief and the averments
said to have been deleted, i.e. the claim said to have been abandoned by said
purshis Exh.16 are also with reference to and in connection with the said mark
'Bhole Bapa'. 18.5 Whereas the subject matter and the cause of action and the
relief prayed for and the claim in the said second suit is the defendant's
(i.e. present petitioner's) alleged act of 'passing off' their (i.e.
defendant's) goods as plaintiff's goods (i.e. goods of present respondent) by
using the mark 'Babu' (which is different and distinct from the trade name
from 'Bhole Bapa' which is the subject matter and cause of action in the first
suit). It has emerged that the said two suits are filed in respect of two
different and distinct trade names / trade marks. The subject-matter and cause
of action in the said second suit is mark 'Babu'. Thus, the claim in the
second suit is not the claim which the plaintiff purportedly / is said to have
45 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT abandoned from the first suit. Merely because
the relief which the plaintiff abandoned from the first suit was against
'passing off' and the second suit is filed against 'passing off', that single
factor is not sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the claim which the
plaintiff is said to have relinquished from the first suit and what is prayed
for in the second suit are the same. The comparative table - which is part of
paragraph No.20 of the plaint in the first suit - demonstrates and illustrates
the said aspect.
19\. At this stage, it would be appropriate to take into account the
observations and findings recorded by the learned trial Court with reference
to the petitioner's objections in light of Order 2 Rule 2. The learned trial
Court has observed and recorded, inter alia, that:
> "Therefore plaintiff's suit before Rajkot District Court No.4/12 is for
> infringement of copy right of artistic lable of BABU against defendants with
> allegation that defendants has violated plaintiff's copy rights of artistic
> lable of BABU by reproducing and imitating the colour scheme, get up, lay
> out and arrangement of features wherein word "BAPA" used in place of "BABU".
> ... ... ... (Emphasis supplied)
> 17\. While in this suit plaintiff has stated in plaint para-11 and 12 that,
> "The plaintiff further submits that the defendant is residing and carrying
> on his business and selling his products under the trademark "BABU" from the
> address shown in the cause title of the plaintiff, which is within the
> jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. Moreover, the goods of the defendant are
> also available within the territorial limits of this Hon'ble Court. Thus the
> entire cause of action has arisen within the JAMNAGAR District. Therefore,
> this Hon'ble Court is having territorial jurisdiction as  46 C/SCA/410/2014
> CAV JUDGMENT provided under the Trade Mark Act, 1999 and empowered to try
> and adjudicate the suit and grant relief as prayed for. Further, this Court
> is also having the jurisdiction under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act,
> 1999 and Civil Procedure Code 1908."
> "The plaintiff further submits that the defendant is unauthorizedly using
> the said trademark "BABU", ... ... ..."
> Thus this suit is pertaining to the unauthorized use by defendants for their
> product under the trade mark "BABU" and relief is passing off etc. Hence the
> facts and even allegation is different in both the suits Nos. 3/12 and 65/12
> (present suit). Suit no. 4/12 is for the product of the defendant under
> lable "BHOLE BABA" while present suit is regarding products of the
> defendants under the label of "BABU" and the relief in present suit is not
> on base of copy right of artistic label "BABU" but it is based on the fact
> that defendants is selling their products LIME under trade mark "BABU" which
> is identical and deceptively similar to the plaintiff's products under trade
> mark "BABU". Therefore, I do not agree with the submission of the L.A. for
> the defendant that this suit is a composite suit of infringement of
> copyright and infringement of trademark. (Emphasis supplied) Thus present
> suit is for passing off under Trade Mark Act and suit No. 4/12 before Rajkot
> District Court is for infringement of copy right and therefore unreported
> judgment of the Hon'ble division bench of Gujarat High Court in L.P.A. No.
> 877/2010 in Special C.A. No. 38/2010 is not applicable in this case and as
> per above mention para-7 of present plaint cause of action is clearly
> disclosed for passing off therefore,"
20\. Since for considering the petitioners' objection in light of Order 2 Rule
2 and/or Order 3 Rule 1(4), it would be necessary to examine the plaints of
the said two suits the relevant parts therefrom are reproduced below. In the
first suit the plaintiff has averred, inter alia, that:
> "8. The "BABU artistic label" form a prominent part of the plaintiff. The
> plaintiff is origniator, bonafide adopter and honest user of "BABU artistic
> label". The plaintiff at the time of adoption the "BABU artistic label" have
> taken market search and after getting the positive reply from the competent
> authority has honestly adopted the "BABU artistic label". The plaintiff
> state and submit that engage in the business above "BABU artistic label"
> from the year 2000. The plaintiff has acquired common Law right as the
> plaintiff is using the said "BABU artistic label"
since 2000, but to acquire statutory right under The Copyright Act, the
plaintiff applied for registration of the "BABU artistic label". Accordingly,
the registration of "BABU artistic label" was granted in favour of the
plaintiff and plaintiff acquired statutory right under The Copyright Act,  47
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT The said Registration of the "BABU artistic label"
shall be prima facie evidence of the validity thereof. The said Registration
is valid, subsisting and is in force. The Copyright Registry issued the
copyright registration in favour of plaintiff. The Photo Copy of the Copyright
Registration is produce with the list of documents. The said Copyright
Registration is obtained on the basis of honest and prior user. The plaintiff
state and submit that as per the provision of The Copyright Act, the plaintiff
is the owner of the "BABU artistic label" and have exclusive right to
reproduce the same. The plaintiff state and submit that the plaintiff is
honest adopter prior user and owner of the artistic work as describe in the
plaint and have a right to restrain the other person, firm, company using the
same or reproduction in material form of plaintiff artistic label. The
plaintiff further says that prior to launching the goods under the Artistic
work had obtained Search Report from The Registrar Of Trade Marks as provided
under The Copyright Act and the report doesn't refer to the names of the
present defendants which otherwise shows that the defendants are subsequent.
14\. In order to maintain distinctive identity the product from the product,
manufacture, merchant, traders and service providers, coined conceived and
honestly adopted a "BABU artistic lable" in the form of a label containing in
an artistic manner (which shall be herein after referred to as the said Label
"BABU artistic lable"). The said label is artistic work having distinct colour
scheme, getup arrangement and eye- catching appearance for reference for
plaintiff product / goods / services the label is annex with a list of
documents. The said label is use by plaintiff openly, extensively and
continuously from the year 2000 in respect of plaintiff product / goods /
services the said label first printed and publish by the plaintiff and
therefore, the plaintiff have exclusive right in the said artistic work of the
label and no person, firm, and company is entitle to reproduce in material &
substantial form, publish or use the said art work in a substantial and
material form OR ANY Essential feature of artistic work / label without prior
permission, license, consent of the plaintiff. The plaintiff further says and
submit that he has not authorised any other person to reproduce the said
Artistic Label.
15\. On a bare perusal of the imitation label of the defendant, it is apparent
that the same is a colourable imitation of the distinctive package /
distinctive label of the plaintiff's and or essential futures of the
plaintiffs distinctive label. Further cumulative effect, total image and
visual impact of the impugned imitation label is substantially identical to
and strongly reminiscent of the plaintiff's distinctive label and is a clear
attempt by the defendant's to simulate the products / services of the
plaintiff's and thereby committing acts of infringement of Copyright that
vests in the Plaintiff.
16\. "BABU artistic label" by the plaintiff under the distinctive label has
acquire valuable reputation and goodwill under the circumstances explain about
look & feel, distinctive trade dress layout colorscheme and getup of the
distinctive label (including combination of colour) are associate by the
public and consumer exclusively with the plaintiff label which resemble or
closely resemble the distinctive label or which contain essential future of
the plaintiff product / goods / services (including combination of colour),
the defendant is misrepresenting there products / goods / services as those of
plaintiff products / goods / services, and/or misrepresentatives that their
goods have some connection or nexus with the goods of plaintiff causing damage
to the plaintiff and to the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff's
business and is also diluting the distinctive of getup, layout looks and
colour scheme  48 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT comprised the distinctively
package and label. Such representation has been done deliberately so as to
ride upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff. Further, such
misrepresentation of is causing / likely conclusion and deception of the
trade, public and consumer. The plaintiff submit that such misrepresentation
of the defendant is infringing or / and attempting to pass off their products
/ goods / services as those of plaintiff's products / goods / services. The
plaintiff submit that the simulation / are resemblance of the imitation and
label with those of the plaintiff's distinctive label with those of the
distinctive label is clear evidence of the dishonest and fraudulent intention
of the defendant to deceive and confuse the public, customer and traders and
thereby earn unauthorised gains. The plaintiff state and submit that such
wrongful action of the defendant amount to unfair competition and is
actionable civil wrong. The plaintiff craves leave to take appropriate action
for the passing off etc., by filing separate suit.
17\. The plaintiff is the copyright owner of the copyright work referred in
plaint. The plaintiff is also the first publisher of the work. The defendant's
labels used on the impugned imitation products / goods / services is / are a
reproduction of or a substantial reproduction of the plaintiff's copyright
work comprise in the label used on distinctive "BABU artistic lable"
represented at list of documents. The same has been unauthorised copy by the
defendant from the plaintiff's label. Further the artistic work represented on
the label is a reproduction or a substantial reproduction of the plaintiff's
label by the defendant. Hence the defendant have infringed the plaintiff's
copyright works.
18\. The plaintiff state and submit that by reason of the above fact, products
/ goods / services under the distinctive artistic label contain the
distinctive look and feel, color scheme; get-up and layout have come to
associate by the traders, by the public and the consumer exclusively with the
plaintiff's products / goods / services, artistic label (including its future
referred in plaint) the plaintiff says that any colourable imitation thereof
is bound to cause confusion and deception in the minds of the public traders
and consumers.
20\. Infringement of label and copyright: the use by the defendant/s of a
closely similar mark for all types of lime, filter lime, double filter lime
(calcium), calcium for betel nut & pan paste is without the consent
authorisation license of the plaintiff and infringement of the plaintiff's
products / goods / services label. The defendant/s has further reproduced the
plaintiff's distinctive label. The colour scheme getup packaging fond
plaintiff's product/label where the artistic label appears in a distinctive
letter instruction for use printed on the label has been reproduce
substantially by the defendant in respect of there products / goods /
services, There by amounting to infringement of the copyright of plaintiff's.
This is evident from a comparison between plaintiff's artwork and the artwork
of the defendant. The plaintiff state and submit that by reproducing and
imitating the colour scheme, getup, layout and arrangement of future as well
as stylish manner of representing the word, the defendant have violated of the
copyright of the plaintiff's said artistic work and liable for infringement of
copyright. The use by the defendant of a closely similar label / mark for all
types of lime, filter lime, double filter lime (calcium), calcium for betel
nut & pan paste is without the consent, authorisation, or licence of the
plaintiffs and amounts to infringement of the plaintiffs copyright. The
defendant serve further reproduce the plaintiffs Blue / Brown and  49

packaging, thereby amounting to infringement the copyright of the plaintiff.
This is evident from a comparison between plaintiffs product and the product

In the said second suit the respondent/plaintiff has averred, inter alia,
that:
> "4. The plaintiff further submits that the plaintiff is selling the products

7\. The plaintiff came to know from the market source that the defendant is
selling its products lime under trademark "BABU", which is identical and
deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark, "BABU". It is further
submitted that the defendant has not only adopted the word "BABU" but the
defendant has also imitated the artistic work of the label and color
combination of the plaintiff. Such act on the part of the defendant is nothing
but a deliberate intention to trade upon the goodwill and reputation of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff has filed Regular Civil Suit for the infringement of
Copyright of his another label under title SHREE BHOLE BAPA bearing Regular
Civil Suit No.4 of 2012 in the Hon'ble District Court, at Rajkot against the
said defendants on 30/7/2012 and as a counterblast to this, the defendant
opted for the another Trade Mark BABU of the plaintiff. This clearly discloses
the deliberate intention of the defendant. The plaintiff is constrained to
file present suit against the defendant for passing off under the trademark
BABU. It is submitted that the defendant has been using the said trademark in
his products. Therefore, it is required for the plaintiff to file the present
suit for passing off action and hence it is not barred under any other
provisions of law. It is further submitted that the plaintiff is not aware of
the constitution of the defendants and therefore the plaintiff craves leave to
amend the pleadings as and when required.
10\. It is further submitted that the defendant never got any permission from
the plaintiff for using the said trademark BABU. Therefore, the plaintiff has
never permitted the defendants to use its trademark, even though the defendant
has been using the same with malafide intention. Therefore, the defendant is
required to be restrained by an order of perpetual injunction from this
Hon'ble Court.
12\. The plaintiff further submits that the defendant is unauthorizedly using
the said trademark "BABU", whereby the customers, retailers and public at
large are deceived and made to believe that the said product bearing trademark
"BABU" sold by the defendants have some relation with the plaintiff. Thereby
the defendants are passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiff and
hence the plaintiff is entitled to get remedy under the provision of Common
Law as well as Trade Marks Act, 1999\. Thus it is clear that the defendants
have deliberately, willfully and with malafide intention used trademark "BABU"
for its product to misguide the customers, retailers and public at large and
make them believe that the defendants products has some connection with the
product provided by the plaintiff and/or that the products which is being sold
by the defendants have origin from plaintiff. It is submitted that because of
such unauthorized use of trademark "BABU" by the defendants, deception has
already taken place in the market, and it is damaging the plaintiff's
reputation and goodwill. It is submitted that the defendants are in no way
connected with the plaintiff's firm and the defendants have not taken any
permission from the plaintiff to use the plaintiff's trademark "BABU".
Therefore, injunction order as prayed for is required to be granted against
the defendants.  52 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
15\. ... ... ... ... ... The present plaintiff submits that the present
plaintiff has filed the suit for infringement of copyright on 30/07/2012.
Therefore immediately as per the alleged assignment deed dated 07/08/2012, he
went to one Ms. S Sayali, of Maharashtra and purchased the trademark BABU
registered under No.: 1494903 as per the above mentioned assignment deed and
filed suit against the present plaintiff on 15/09/2012 though knowing fully
well about the settled principles of law. The plaintiff at this juncture begs
to submit that the Rights conferred by registration are subject to other
provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. It is further submitted that the
settled law provides better rights to a person who is prior in adoption and
use of the disputed Trade Mark. The plaintiff further submits that the
plaintiff has filed rectification application against the defendants before
the competent authority, which is still under process of adjudication before
the competent authority. As per the above mentioned facts and circumstances
for sake of argument, it creates a doubt on the defendants pleadings made in
plaint and if he is using the said trademark since 2006 and he is the owner of
the said trademark as per his own averments than what was the reasons to
purchase the said trademark immediately from third party. It is also pertinent
to note that the present defendants have not produced any single documentary
evidence with respect to partnership deed of firm or any documentary evidence
with respect to any proprietorship except alleged assignment deed supported by
an affidavit of the assignor.
18\. The plaintiff respectfully submits that the cause of action arose to file
this suit against defendant when the plaintiff came to know that the defendant
has adopted and used word "BABU", which is ditto-to- ditto same and identical
to the plaintiff's trademark "BABU" and filed a Regular Civil Suit under No. :
07/12 against the present plaintiff and when the defendant published caution
notice in Akila & AAJKAL daily newspapers published from Rajkot and when the
plaintiff says and submits that the cause of action is recurring one and when
the defendant has filed a civil suit No.7/2012 before this Hon'ble District
Court of Rajkot for infringement of trademark BABU. Moreover, the defendant is
using the said trademark within territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court.
23\. Therefore, plaintiff prays as under:
"(a) The defendants, its directors, its successors, servants, agents,
assignees, dealers, sellers, stockiest and/or distributors and/or anybody
claiming through the defendant be restrained permanently and perpetually from
using the trademark "BABU" and/or any other identical and/or deceptively
similar mark of their products and thereby passing off their goods as the
goods of the plaintiff.
(b) A decree may be passed against the defendants and in favour of the
plaintiff for the declaration that the plaintiff is only the proprietor of the
trademark "BABU" and declare that only the plaintiff is entitled to sell
product under the trademark "BABU".
(c) The defendants be ordered to produce accounts for selling product to his
customers under the trademark "BABU" and be directed to pay the profit
whatsoever derived from selling product under the illegal use of trademark
"BABU" to the plaintiff with interest @ 18% from the date of filing of this
suit till realization. The Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct t he defendants
to pay the damages for the loss of reputation and goodwill, which may deem fit
and proper to this Hon'ble  53 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT Court in the
interest of justice.
(d) Any other and further relief as may be deemed just and proper looking to
the facts and circumstances of the case, be granted in the interest of
justice.
(e) A heavy exemplary cost of the suit may be awarded to the plaintiff." "
21\. In view of the petitioners' objection in light of Order 2 Rule 2 it is
relevant to mention with reference to the said first suit that, even according
to the petitioners, the plaintiff of the said suit prayed for relief against
alleged infringement of copyright as well as alleged passing off, with
reference to the trade name Bhole Bapa. Thus, in the said first suit, the
plaintiff prayed for entire relief which could have been prayed for so far as
the said trade name Bhole Bapa is concerned and that, therefore, it cannot be
said that with regard to the said trade name, the plaintiff did not pray for
entire relief and/or omitted to claim entire relief which could have been
prayed for with regard to the trade name Bhole Bapa.
21.1 Moreover, in the said second suit any relief, in any form or in any
manner, is not prayed for with reference to the said trade name 'Bhole Bapa'.
Actually, after having filed the purshis Exh.16, the plaintiff,  54
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT according to the submission and statement by
learned counsel for the plaintiff, i.e. present respondent, has not filed
other suit with reference to or in connection with the very same trade name,
i.e. Bhole Bapa.
21.2 Furthermore, the said second suit is an action against passing off by
using the trade name / trade mark 'Babu' (and not the trade name 'Bhole
Bapa'). Therefore, in view of the legal position that a composite suit for
protection of copyright and against passing off is not maintainable, any
relief against passing off with reference to the trade name / trade mark
'Babu' (which is the subject-matter of and cause of action for the said second
suit) could not have been included and prayed for in the first suit because
inclusion of such claim or relief would have turned the said first suit into
composite suit. 21.3 From the foregoing discussion, it has emerged that (a)
the plaintiff (respondent herein) did not omit to claim any relief which he
could have otherwise claimed in and at the time of first suit and/or (b) the
plaintiff has not  55 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT claimed/resurrected, in the
second suit, the claim/relief/cause of action which he abandoned from the said
first suit; and, above everything (c) the cause of action in the second suit
is not the same as in the said first suit and/or the claim and cause of action
in the second suit is not the same which the plaintiff is said to have deleted
/ abandoned from first suit.
21.4 Moreover, the basic and primary requirement (viz. unity and similarity of
cause of action and/or claim in the first and the subsequent suits) for
invoking and applying the provision under Order 2 Rule 2 is absent and the
petitioners have failed to establish that there is unity and similarity of the
claim and/or cause of action in the said two suits. Hence, from any
perspective and angle and on any ground it cannot be said that the said second
suit is hit by Order 2 Rule 2. In this view of the matter, the contention
raised in light of Order 2 Rule 2 fails and the objection at earlier mentioned
Sr.No.(iii)(a) is not sustainable. In this view of the matter, the objection
in light of Order 2 Rule 2 fails.
56 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
21.5 There is yet another facet related to this objection. The said second
suit by present respondent is an action against alleged passing off by the
petitioners. With reference to action against passing off Hon'ble Apex Court
has, in the decision in case of Bengal Waterproof Ltd. vs. Bombay Waterproof
Mnfg. Co. [AIR 1997 SC 1398], held that act of passing off gives recurring
cause of action and whenever and wherever fresh deceitful act is committed,
the person deceived will have a fresh cause of action and action against
passing off will not be hit by provision under Order 2 Rule 2. In the said
decision Hon'ble Apex Court observed:
> "11. ... ... ... ... ... ... It is obvious that such infringement of a
> registered trade mark carried on from time to time would give a recurring
> cause of action to the holder of the trade mark to make a grievance about
> the same and similarly such impugned passing off actions also would give a
> recurring cause of action to the plaintiff to make a grievance about the
> same and to seek appropriate relief from the court. It is now well settled
> that an action foe passing off is a common law remedy being an action in
> substance of deceit under the Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever fresh
> deceitful act is committed the person deceived would naturally have a fresh
> cause of action in his favour. Thus every time when a person passes off his
> goods as those of another he commits the act of such deceit. Similarly
> whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trade mark of
> another he commits a recurring act of breach of infringement of such trade
> mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such
> infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in such a
> case when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not
> maintainable in absence of proper reliefs, for all times to come in future
> defendant of such a suit should be armed with a licence to go on committing
> fresh acts of infringement and passing off with impunity without being
> subjected to any legal action against such future acts. We posed a question
> to the learned counsel for the  57 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT defendants as
> to whether after the disposal of the earlier suit if the defendants had
> suspended their business activities and after a few years had resumed the
> same and had started selling their goods under the trade mark `DACK BACK'
> passing them off, the plaintiff could have been prohibited and prevented by
> the bar of Order 2 Rule 2 sub-
rule (3) from filing a fresh suit in future when such future infringement or
passing off took place. He rightly and fairly stated that such a suit would
not be barred. But his only grievance was that whatever was the infringement
or passing off alleged against the defendants in 1980 had, according to the
plaintiff, continued uninterrupted and, therefor, in substance the cause of
action in both the suits was identical. It is difficult to agree. In cases of
continuous causes of action or recurring causes of action bar of Order 2 Rule
2 sub-rule (3) cannot be invoked. In this connection it is profitable to have
a lock at Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963. It lays down that `in the
case of a continuing tort, a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every
moment of the time during which the beach or the tort, as the case may be,
continues'. As act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort every time when
such tortious act or deceit is committed by the defendant the plaintiff gets a
fresh cause of action to some to the court by appropriate proceedings.
Similarly infringement of a registered trade mark would also be a continuing
wrong so long as infringementcontinues. Therefore, whether the earlier
infringement has continuer or a new infringement has taken place cause of
action for filing a fresh suit would obviously arise in favour of the
plaintiff who is aggrieved by such fresh infringements of trade mark or fresh
passing off actions alleged against the defendant. Consequently, in our view
even on merits the learned Trial Judge as well as the learned Single Judge
were obviously in error in taking the view that the second suit of the
plaintiff in the present case was barred by Order 2 Rule 2 sub-rule (3), CPC."
(Emphasis supplied) Thus, act of passing off gives fresh and recurring cause
of action and in case of continuous or recurring causes of action, Order 2
Rule (2) sub-rule (3) is not applicable and cannot be invoked.
Re: Order 23 Rule 1(4):
22\. So far as the provision under Order 23 Rule 1(4) is concerned, (a) the
said provision will be attracted and will be applicable only if the 'subject
matter' of the second/subsequent suit is the same as in the previous/first  58
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT suit or it is same as part of the claim which he
abandoned from first suit; and (b) the said provision comes into play after
the institution of a suit; (c) the said provision enables and allows the
plaintiff to abandon, subject to and with permission of the Court, entire suit
or to abandon part of the claim raised in the suit after the suit is
instituted; (d) the restriction or prohibition prescribed under the said
provision are (in the event the plaintiff withdraws the suit or part of the
claim) mandatory; (e) however, it will be applicable when unity of the parties
and of the 'subject-matter' and claim is established; (f) when a plaintiff
withdraws his suit or part of his claim without Court's permission, he stands
disentitled to institute fresh suit in respect of same 'subject-matter' or
such part of the claim.
22.1 If the defendant establishes relevant factors e.g. institution of second
suit after withdrawing previous suit/part of the claim, and also establishes
absence of permission by the Court, unity of the parties in both the suits, as
well as unity and similarity of the subject-matter and claim in the said two
suits, then the said provision  59 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT would be
attracted. But if the person raising objection against the suit fails to
establish the said aspects, then the said provision will not be applicable.
The obligation to establish relevant aspects is on the person who attacks the
suit by invoking this provision.
22.2 Thus, according to the said provision the primary and basic, or cardinal,
requirement is similarity and unity of 'subject matter'. If the 'subject
matter' of the fresh/subsequent suit is not the same as in the first suit (or
is not same as the claim/part of the claim first suit which the plaintiff
abandoned) then the said provision will not be applicable and the fresh/second
suit will not be hit by said provision.
22.3 At this stage, it is relevant to mention that on examination of the
plaints in both the suits, it has emerged that the subject-matter and the
cause of action in the said second suit is not the same as in the first suit
and the subject matter and/or the claim in the second suit is not in respect
of the claim which the plaintiff allegedly  60 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT
relinquished from the said first suit. Therefore, in present case, the said
provision viz. Sub-Rule (4) of Rule (1) of Order 23 is not attracted and is
not applicable. 22.4 The petitioners have opposed the said second suit in
light of Order 23 Rule 1(4). On this count, it is claimed that by filing
purshis Exh.16 in the said first suit, the plaintiff abandoned claim against
passing off and since the said claim is abandoned without Court's permission,
the said second suit is not maintainable. In this context it is relevant to
mention that while examining the objection in light of Order 2 Rule 2 the
factual aspects have been examined in detail and those aspects have been
discussed at length hereinabove earlier (under heading Order 2 Rule
2). Therefore, repetition is avoided. Suffice it to say that though the said
second suit is an action against alleged 'passing off' actually the said
second suit is in respect of altogether different and distinct subject matter
and cause of action viz. trade name / trade mark viz. 'Babu'. Thus, the basic
and primary requirement similarity and unity of subject matter to attract
provision under Order 23 Rule 1(4) is absent in the second suit. Consequently,
the said  61 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT provision, i.e. Order 23 Rule 1(4)
will not be applicable to the said second suit.
22.5 When it has emerged that the cardinal and primary requirement for
applicability of and for attracting the bar under Order 23 Rule 1(4) (viz.
similarity and unity of the 'subject matter') is absent and it has also
emerged that even the cause of action and the relief prayed for in the second
suit is different from the subject matter and cause of action in the first
suit as well as from the claim said to have been withdrawn, then, as a
corollary it would follow that the second suit is not hit by the bar under
said provision. Consequently, other aspects and/or other factual details will
not survive and will not be relevant and/or would pale into insignificance.
Therefore, once the aforesaid facts have emerged and thereby it has also
emerged that the second suit is not hit by said provision then other or
further sequence and details of events related to said second suit (viz.
whether said second suit was filed before and was pending when, the plaintiff
submitted the purshis Exh.16 or not i.e. whether the said  62 C/SCA/410/2014
CAV JUDGMENT purshis was filed / submitted after the second suit was filed)
need not detain the Court and they may not be discussed after the above-
mentioned facts have emerged. However, so as to complete the record those
aspects need to be mentioned and considered.
22.6 In this context, it may be mentioned that first suit was filed on
30.7.2012 and the second suit came to be filed on 3.11.2012 whereas the
purshis exhibit 16 was filed on 9.11.2012 i.e. after the second suit was
filed. Thus the second suit was already filed and was pending when the
plaintiff filed the said purshis and when the second suit came to be filed the
said first suit and / or the part of claim in the first suit was not withdrawn
/ abandoned. By the said purshis exhibit 16 the plaintiff had "declared" that
he "will delete" the claim and averments with regard to passing off from the
first suit, however, such claim or such averments were actually not deleted
from the said first suit. In fact it was only on 29.12.2012 that the plaintiff
submitted the application (dated 15.12.2012. Exh.22) under Order 6 Rule 17. It
is also pertinent that final order  63 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT below the
said application is not passed. Consequently actual withdrawal / abandonment
of the claim and averments from the first suit has not taken place. However
Mr. Shah, learned advocate for petitioner would claim that once the purshis
exhibit 16 is filed the declaration contained therein should be deemed to have
become effective and the claim and averments from the first suit should be
deemed to have been deleted. Even if the said submission by leaned Counsel for
petitioner is accepted and submission of purshis (on the record of first suit)
is, in itself, considered and construed as withdrawal and abandonment of the
claim (related to passing off) from said first suit, then also such withdrawal
or abandonment of the claim would be effective from the date of submission of
said purshis (Exh.16). Since the said purshis exhibit 16 was filed on
9.11.2012 (i.e. after the second suit was filed on 3.11.2012) the said part of
the claim, even according to the submission by the petitioners would stand
deleted on 9.11.2012 when the second suit was already filed and was pending
since 3.11.2012.  64 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT 22.7 In this context, it may
be mentioned that the provision under Order 23 rule (1)(4) would be applicable
if the second suit is filed, in respect of same subject matter, 'after' the
previous suit or part of the claim in the previous suit is abandoned /
relinquished. On this count, reference may be made to the decision in case of
(a) Girdharilal Bansal vs. The Chairman, Bhakra Beas Management Board [AIR
1985 Punjab and Hariyana 219(1)], wherein with reference to Order 23 Rule 1(4)
the High Court, in paragraph 2 of the judgment, observed, inter alia, that:-
> "4. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, I give the following
> findings issue-wise.
> Issue No. 1.
> This issue relates to the matter whether the second petition filed by the
> contractor on the same allegations and for the same relief is barred under
> O.23, R.1(4) of the Civil P.C. or not in view of the fact that the earlier

> and Har 169) (FB)and decided the issue against the contractor and held that

> not challenged the dictum laid down in the aforesaid decision but has argued

(b) Similarly in the decision in case of P.A.
65 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT Muhammed vs. The Canara Bank (AIR 1992 KERALA
85) High Court of Kerala, relying on the decision in case of Girdharilal
Bansal (supra), has observed, inter alia, that:
> "7. No doubt, under O. XXIII, R. 1, C. P. C. "at any time after the
> institution of a suit, the plaintiff may as against all or any of the
> defendants, abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim" (subject of
> course, to what is contained in the proviso). Under sub-rule (3), where the
> Court is "satisfied that the suit must fail by rason of some formal defect,
> or that there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute
> a fresh suit for the subject-matter of a suit or part of a claim, it may, on
> such terms as it thinks fit, grant him permission to withdraw from such suit
> or such part of the claim with liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect
> of the subject-matter of such suit or such part of the claim". Under sub-
> rule (4), where the plaintiff "abandons any suit or part of claim, or
> withdraws from a suit or part of a claim, without the permission referred to
> in sub-rule (3), he shall be liable for such cost as the court may award and
> shall be precluded from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such
> subject-matter or such part of the claim". The court below held that rule
> 1(4) applied to the case and therefore, the suit was barred. But, then, the
> fact that the second suit was pending when the first suit was dismissed as
> withdrawn, went unnoticed. The question to decide is whether in such a

> 8\. As noticed above, sub-rule(4) of Rule 1 of Order XXIII, C.P.C. precluded
> the plaintiff from instituting a fresh suit where the earlier suit was
> withdrawn or abandoned without permission of the Court. It is clear that the

> leave of court. But, where the subsequent suit was pending when the earlier
> one was dismissed as withdrawn, abandoned or as not pressed, the provisions
> of O. XXIII, Rule 1, in terms, would be inapplicable."
22.8 Thus, as observed and held in the said decisions if the second suit is
filed before the first suit (or part of the claim in the first suit is
abandoned) then the bar under Order 23 Rule 1 (4) will not be applicable.
However, learned Counsel Mr. Mehul Shah relied on the decision by High Court
of Calcutta in case of Prapti Fashions (Pvt.) Limited vs. Manoj kumar Gupta
(2013 (55) PTC 234 Cal.)  66 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT wherein reliance is
placed on AIR 2003 Raj. 319. In the decision in AIR 2003 Raj. 319 (which is
referred to in case of Prapti Fashion (supra) relied on by the petitioner) it
is observed, inter alia, that:
> "16. It is true that the party is required to take permission from the Court
> under O. 23, R. 1(3) of the C.P.C. only if party wants to institute a fresh
> suit in respect of the same subject-matter. Order 23, R. 1(3), C.P.C. is not
> dealing with the situation where before withdrawal of suit, the plaintiff

> 22.9 Thus, even in the said decision, the legal position viz. (a) permission
> will be necessary only if the party wants to file fresh suit for same
> subject matter;
and (b) Order 23 Rule 1(4) will not apply tot he case where second suit is
filed and thereafter the first suit is withdrawn (which is the case in present
matter). In the said decision, i.e. AIR 2003 Raj 319, it is observed that such
course of action may make the provision nugatory. However, with regard to the
said decision what is relevant to note is that on reading of the said decision
it appears  67 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT that the concept of 'recurring
cause of action' which is laid down and explained by Hon'ble Apex Court in
case of Bengal Waterproof Limited [AIR 1997 SC 1398] did not arise for
consideration and, therefore, was not considered in the said decision AIR 2003
Raj 319. In the said decision [AIR 1997 SC 1398] Hon'ble Apex Court has
observed that act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort and every time
when such tortious act or deceit is committed by the defendant the plaintiff
gets a fresh cause of action to come to the court by appropriate proceedings
and that in the case where recurring cause of action arise the provision under
Order 2 Rule 2(3) does not apply. Thus, so far as the second suit is concerned
(in respect of which the objection is raised) it being an action against
alleged passing off the plaintiff has recurring or continuous cause of action.
22.10 It is pertinent that in the case of N.R. Narayan Swamy vs. B. Francis
Jagan (supra), Hon'ble Apex Court applied the concept of 'recurring cause of
action' in respect of eviction suit under Rent Act and observed, inter  68
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT alia, that in matters of recurring cause the
restriction under Order 23 Rule 1(4) is not applicable. In the said decision
Hon'ble Apex Court has observed:
> "6. In our view, the High Court ought to have considered the fact that in
> eviction proceedings under the Rent Act the ground of bona fide requirement
> or non-payment of rent is a recurring cause and, therefore, landlord is not
> precluded from instituting fresh proceeding. In an eviction suit on the
> ground of bona fide requirement the genuineness of the said ground is to be
> decided on the basis of requirement on the date of the suit. Further, even
> if a suit for eviction on the ground of bona fide requirement is filed and
> is dismissed it cannot be held that once a question of necessity is decided
> against the landlord he will not have a bona fide and genuine necessity ever
> in future. In the subsequent proceedings, if such claim is established by
> cogent evidence adduced by the landlord, decree for possession could be
> passed. {Re: K.S. Sundararaju Chettiar vs. M.R. Ramachandra Naidu [(1994) 5
> SCC 14 (para 10)] and Surajmal vs. Radhe Shyam [(1988) 3 SCC 18]}.
> 10\. The aforesaid rule would have no application in a proceeding initiated
> for recovering the suit premises on the ground of bona fide requirement
> which is a recurring cause. Order XXIII rule 1(4)(b) precludes the plaintiff
> from instituting any fresh suit in respect of such subject matter or such
> part of the claim which the plaintiff has withdrawn. In a suit for eviction
> of a tenant under the Rent Act on the ground of bona fide requirement even
> though the premises remains the same, the subject matter which is cause of
> action may be different. The ground for eviction in the subsequent
> proceedings is based upon requirement on the date of the said suit even
> though it relates to the same property. Dealing with similar contention in
> Vallabh Das vs. Dr. Madanlal and Others [(1970) 1 SCC 761)], this Court
> observed thus:-
> "The expression subject-matter is not defined in the Civil Procedure Code.
> It does not mean property. That expression has a reference to a right in the
> property which the plaintiff seeks to enforce. That expression includes the
> cause of action and the relief claimed. Unless the cause of action and the
> relief claimed in the second suit are the same as in the first suit, it
> cannot be said that the subject-matter of the second suit is the same as
> that in the previous suit."
> 11\. The Court further observed that the mere identity of some of the issues
> in two suits would not bring about identity of the subject matter in two
> suits." (Emphasis supplied) 22.11 In the decision in AIR 2003 Raj 319 the
> concept of recurring cause of action and the above referred two decisions by
> Apex Court did not arise for consideration in  69 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
> JUDGMENT view of the facts of that case. Therefore, the said decision would
> not render assistance to the petitioner and so far as the decision in case
> of Prapti Fashion (supra) is concerned, in the said decision the High Court
> found that the subject matter in both suits was same, whereas in present
> case it has emerged, on examination of facts, that the subject matter in
> case of the said two suits are different.
> 23\. In this view of the matter, even if the submission by learned Counsel
> for the petitioners in light of the decision in AIR 2003 Raj. 319 and in
> case of Prapti Fashion is accepted and even if in present case the Court
> proceeds on the premise or on assumption that submission of the purshis
> Exh.16 in the first suit, in itself, amounts to and should be teated as
> actual withdrawal of the claim against passing off, then also in view of the
> fact that in the matter of passing off the plaintiff has recurring cause of
> action, the bar under Order 23 Rule 1 (4) will not be attracted.
23.1 Furthermore, in present case even if one goes a step further and proceeds
on the premise or assumption  70 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT that though the
second suit is an action against passing off and though the plaintiff has
recurring cause of action (as held by Apex Court in above referred two
decisions) but the said concept may not be applied in present case then also
the petitioners' contention and objection should fail because the primary and
fundamental requirement for attracting Order 23 Rule 1(4) viz. similarity and
unity of subject matter of second suit and first suit is absent in present
matter, i.e. in second suit.
24\. With reference to the said second suit most relevant and important aspect
is that the fundamental and basic requirement (for attracting Order 23 Rule
1(4) of the Code) viz. similarity and unity of subject matter and / or
similarity and unity of cause of action, is absent in the second suit and
that, therefore, even if the above- mentioned submissions by the petitioners
are, for the sake of considering the objection, accepted then also, in view of
the aforesaid vital fact the said objections against the second suit should
fail.
24.1 Since, the subject matter and the cause of  71 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT action of the second suit is different from the subject matter and
cause of action in the first suit as well as from the claim said to have been
abandoned (from the said first suit by virtue of the purshis exhibit 16), the
provision under Order 23 Rule 1(4) will not be applicable to the said second
suit. Thus, the said second suit does not deserve to be rejected in exercise
of power under Order 7 Rule 11
(d).
25\. At this stage, the decisions relied on by learned senior counsel for the
petitioners may be considered. So far as the decisions relied on by the
petitioners are concerned, learned senior counsel relied on the decision dated
7.3.2012 in Letters Patent Appeal No.877 of 2010, wherein the Division Bench
has observed that the cause of action with regard to infringement of copyright
and passing off are different and therefore, a composite suit cannot be filed.
In present case, on plain reading of the plaint, it has emerged that the
second suit is not based on cause of action related to infringement of
copyright. In the decision in the case of T. Arivandandam (supra), the Hon'ble
Apex Court observed that where the suit is found  72 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV
JUDGMENT to be vexatious and meritless, then the power under Order 7 Rule 11
should be exercised. In present case, after considering facts of the case and
the material on record, particularly the plaint of second suit, it is found
that the suit cannot be termed as vexatious or abuse of process, as alleged by
the petitioners. In the decision in case of Maharaj Shri Manvendrasinhji
Ranjitsinhji Jadeja (supra), the Division Bench, on meticulous examination of
the facts of the case, the relevant provisions and the averments in the
plaint, found that the covenant on which the plaintiff replied did not give
out any cause of action and it was not possible to read in the articles of the
covenant that rule of primogeniture was guaranteed to the erstwhile rulers of
Kathiawar. In present case, it has emerged from the details and averments in
the plaint that the petitioners have claimed that on account of prior user of
the trademark in question, the plaintiff has acquired certain rights and
benefits available under the Trade Marks Act. Thus, the facts of the present
case are different from the set of facts in the cited decision. Likewise, the
facts of present case are different from the facts involved in the  73
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT decision in case of Chandrakant Kantilal Jhaveri
(supra). In the case of Croft Sales and Distribution Ltd. (supra) the Division
Bench, on examination of the plaint, reached to the conclusion that the whole
suit was based on hypothesis and not on any liability which could be
identified under Indian Law on date of institution of the suit, whereas in the
case on hand, material facts and averments in the suit bring out cause of
action as well as averments necessary to maintain action for passing off. In
the decision in case of Sheela Adhikari (supra), the Calcutta High Court dealt
with the issue wherein the suit comprises some causes of action which lie
within the jurisdiction of the Court where it is filed and other do not. In
view of such facts the Court observed that if the Court can return the plaint
and allow the plaintiff to resubmit the plaint after necessary deletion, then
the plaintiff can also be allowed to do the same thing while the plaint is on
Court's file. The said decision does help the petitioners. The decision in
case of Bloom Dekor Limited (supra) as well as Dahyabhai Ranabhai Vaghela
(supra) are materially different on facts as well as in respect of the  74
C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT issue involved in the said cases than the case on
hand. The other decisions are also materially different on facts and do not
assist the petitioners. In view of the fact that in present case, the Court
has, upon examining the facts and the plaint in detail, reached to the
conclusion that the second suit is not for the same cause of action as in the
first suit, the decision in the case of Hindustan Zinc Limited (supra) does
not assist the petitioners inasmuch as in the said case, the Court, on facts
observed that '... ... ... I have no manner of doubt in holding that very
contentions are repeated in the second suit....' and that, therefore, the
Court held that the suit amounts to abuse of process. So far as the decisions
in case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra) as well as in case of Khoday
Distilleries Limited (supra) are concerned, when present case is examined in
light of the said decision as well as decisions relied on by the plaintiff, it
emerges that the plaint contains primary, basic and proper averments necessary
to present a suit against alleged passing off. As mentioned earlier, at this
stage, the Court would not enter into the issue as to whether the allegations
are true or not  75 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT and whether they are
sufficient to establish alleged passing off and/or as to whether the evidence
is sufficient to lead the plaintiff to success in his action or not are
matters of evidence and therefore, the said decision are not of assistance at
this stage (though it might be while trial proceeds on merits). However, at
this stage, it cannot be concluded that the plaint is hit by the said
decision. In the decision in case of Khoday Distilleries Limited (supra), the
suit was opposed on ground of delay. In present case, at this stage, the said
issue is not raised by the petitioners/defendants. Besides this, the said
issue is a mixed question of fact and law and would otherwise also, if raised,
can be and will be decided during the trial. So far as the decisions in cases
of Virgo Industries (Eng.) Private Limited, State Bank of India vs. Gracure
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) as well as in case of N.V. Srinivass Murthy
(supra) are concerned, the Hon'ble Court, in the said decisions, considered
the matters in light of Order 2 Rule 2. The said provision would come in
picture when the cause of action in both the suits is common. In present case,
the subject-matter and cause of action in  76 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT the
said two suits are different. In this view of the matter, the decisions do not
help the petitioners. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners also relied
on the decision dated 10.10.2013 in Appeal from Order No.154 of 2013. It is a
decision in an appeal under Order 43 Rule 1(r), wherein order below
application for interim relief, whereby the learned trial Court had, in
exercise of power under Order 39 Rule 1, granted interim relief against the
defendants, was challenged. Moreover, in the said decision, the subject-matter
in both the suits was use of trademark 'Dandi Namak / Dandi Salt' and both the
suits, i.e. subsequent suit, wherein the impugned order under Order 39 was
passed and the previous suit which came to be withdrawn, were related to and
in connection with the use of the same (i.e. above-mentioned) trademark.
Besides this, in the said decision, the Court reached to specific conclusion
and finding that the plaintiff had furnished false declaration and both the
suits were based on same cause of action and the case suffered from
suppression of material facts and the plaintiff did not approach the Court
with clean hands. Thus, the said  77 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT decision also
does not render any assistance to the petitioners in light of the facts of
second suit.
26\. In this view of the matter, the conclusion reached by the learned trial
Court cannot be faulted and the impugned order does not warrant interference.
The petitioner has failed to make out any ground or justification to convince
the Court to set aside the impugned order. Therefore, the petition fails and
deserves to be rejected and is accordingly rejected. Notice is discharged.
