This appeal filed by the assessee is directed against the order of CIT(A) - 5,
Hyderabad, dated 29/07/2016 for AY 2012-13.
2\. Brief facts of the case are, the assessee is a company in which the public
are not substantially interested and is engaged in manufacture and sale of
high value of biological products. For the assessment year 2012-13, it filed
its return of income on 27.9.2012 admitting an income of Rs.3,21,61,238/ - and
claiming set off of the carried forward loss of the same amount. Thus , the
total income is returned at Rs. Nil. The Assessing officer completed the
assessment u/s 143(3) on 03.02.2015. He determined the total income at
Rs.5,77,66,206/-. The Assessing Officer allowed the brought forward loss of
Rs.5,77,66,206/ - and determined the total income at Rs. "Nil".

ITA No. 1402/Hyd/16 Virchow Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
2.1 The assessee had incurred an amount of Rs. 2,56,04,968/ - towards R&D
expenses and claimed weighted deduction u/s 35(2AB) at the rate of 200% that
amounted to Rs. 5,12,09,936/ -. When the AO asked the assessee to submit the
necessary approval from the prescribed authority in support of the claim of
the deduction, the assessee submitted a copy of renewal recognition of in
-house R&D unit dated 27/06/2008 in which the recognition is only valid upto
31/03/2011 only. The AO noted that the assessee has not furnished the required
approvals from the Secretary, Department of Scientific & Industrial Research,
Govt. of India. Further, he observed that the main requirement for claiming
deduction u/s 35(2AB) is that the assessee has to furnish Form No. 3CL issued
by the Secretary DSIR and the assessee has not furnished the forms 3CK and 3CM
also. Since the assessee has not fulfilled the conditions for allowing
weighted deduction, the AO allowed only actual expenditure incurred by the
assessee and the balance of Rs. 2,56,04,968/ - added back to the income
returned by the assessee.
3\. When the assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT(A), the CIT(A)
discussed the issue elaborately referring to the provisions of section 35(2AB)
as well as case law and confirmed the order of AO.
4\. Aggrieved by the order of CIT(A), the assessee is in appeal before us
raising the following grounds of appeal:
> "1. The order of the learned Commissioner of Income -Tax (Appeals) is
> erroneous both on facts and in law.
> 2\. The learned Commissioner of Income -Tax (Appeals) erred in confirming
> the action of the Assessing officer in holding that the appellant is not
> entitled for deduction u /s 35(2AB) of the I.T. Act.
> 3\. The learned Commissioner of Income -Tax (Appeals) ought to have held
> that the appellant fulfilled the conditions mentioned u/s 35(2AB) of the
> I.T. Act and is entitled for deduction u/s 35(2AB) of the I.T. Act of
> Rs.2,56,04,968/ -.

> 4\. The learned Commissioner of Income-Tax (Appeals) erred in confirming the
> action of the Assessing Officer in levying interest u/s 234B and 234C of the
> I.T. Act."
5\. Before us, ld. AR of the assessee invited our attention to the pages 35 to
127 of the paper book, wherein the correspondence made by the assessee to Dept
of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, New
Delhi, to demonstrate that the assessee is pursuing the matter with the
Ministry for approval in form 3CL. Ld. AR submitted that the said
correspondence was already available with the revenue authorities . Further,
he submitted that assessee is following with the authorities to get the
required approvals in form 3CL. He prayed that this issue may be remitted back
to AO and AO can verify the same and complete the assessment accordingly.
6\. On the other hand, the ld. DR relied on the orders of revenue authorities.
7\. Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. On
perusal of correspondence made by the assessee with the Ministry of Science
and Technology, we notice that the issue is pending with the Ministry for
approval. We do agree with the AO that the Ministry has to approve the actual
expenditure incurred by the assessee in order to allow the weighted deduction.
We, therefore, remit the matter back to the file of the AO with a direction to
re -do the assessment de-novo after the assessee submits the approval from the
competent authority. Even the AO can follow up with the Ministry in this
regard. The assessee is directed to pursue the matter with the Ministry for
approval diligently. Accordingly, the grounds raised by the assessee are
treated as allowed for statistical purposes.
