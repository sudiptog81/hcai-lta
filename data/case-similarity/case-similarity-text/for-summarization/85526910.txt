This appeal by the Revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax, 1961 ('Act'
for short) in the case of M/s Mary Kay Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd. ('respondent -
assessee' for short) pertains to the Assessment Year 2010-11 and impugns the
Pvt. Ltd. (supra), a decision authored by one of us (Sanjiv Khanna, J.),
"Bright Line Method" has been disapproved and rejected.
9\. We have examined the Assessment Order and do not find any good ground and
reason given therein to treat advertisement and sales ITA No.1010/2018 Page 3
of 4 promotion expenses as a separate and independent international
transaction and not to regard and treat the said activity as a function
performed by the respondent-assessee, who was engaged in marketing and
distribution. Further, while segregating/debundling and treating advertisement
and sales promotion as an independent and separate international transaction,
the Assessing Officer did not apportion the operating profit/income as
declared and accepted in respect of the international transactions.
10\. ITA No.213/2018 filed by the Revenue in the case of the respondent-
assessee against the order of the Tribunal for the Assessment Year 2009-10 was
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 20.2.2018. This order also records
that the respondent-assessee having suffered losses had closed its business in
India.
assessee' for short) pertains to the Assessment Year 2010-11 and impugns the
order dated 28th March, 2018 of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal („Tribunal‟
for short).
2\. The respondent-assessee a wholly owned Indian subsidiary of M/s Mary Kay
Inc., a company incorporated in United States of America, was appointed and
had acted as an exclusive distributor of products manufactured by and procured
from the holding company, i.e. M/s Mary Kay Inc., and its associated
enterprises. As a distributor the respondent-assessee had undertaken marketing
and sales activities of the products manufactured, procured and purchased from
M/s Mary Kay Inc. and their associated companies.
3\. In the return for the Assessment Year 2010-11 filed on 13th October, 2010
the respondent-assessee had declared loss of Rs.10,06,07,118/-.
ITA No.1010/2018 Page 1 of 4
4\. The respondent-assessee had, in the transfer pricing report, declared
three international transactions and applied Transaction Net Margin Method
with Operating Costs/Total Cost as the Profit Level Indicator to determine the
Arm‟s Length Price for (i) purchase of finished goods and (ii) purchase of
products for business and applied Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method to
determine Arm‟s Length Price for (iii) reimbursement of expenses as per
details given below:
> S.No Description of the transactions Amount (in Rs.)
> (a) Purchase of finished goods 32,501,399
> (b) Purchase of products for business 1,288,481
> (c) Reimbursement of expenses 1,997,176
5\. The Assessing Officer vide Assessment Order dated 21 st March, 2013, did
not disturb the Arm‟s Length Price as declared in respect of the three
international transactions, but he treated advertisement and sales promotion
expenses of Rs.2,78,95,257/- as a separate and an independent international
transaction. The Assessing Officer observed that advertisement and sales
promotion expenses of Rs.2,28,76,787/- on the turnover of Rs.11,07,04,873/-,
in the ratio of 25.2 per cent, was exceptionally high. He applied "Bright Line
Method" by referring to advertisement, marketing and sales promotion expenses
viz. the sales ratio in the case of M/s Hindustan Unilever of 13.14 per cent,
M/s Jyothy Laboratories of 7.4 per cent and M/s Surya Vinayak of 0.09 percent.
Accordingly, transfer pricing addition of Rs.2,28,76,787/-
ITA No.1010/2018 Page 2 of 4
was made. In alternative, the Assessing Officer held that the expenditure
incurred by the respondent-assessee on advertisement and sales promotion of
Rs.2,28,76,787/- was not allowable under Section 37(1) of the Act. The
respondent-assessee not being the brand owner should not have incurred these
expenses as they were incurred for promoting a brand belonging to the
associated enterprise.
6\. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) vide order dated 11th June, 2014
reversed the findings and deleted the addition made by the Assessing Officer
by applying "Bright Line Method". He held that expenditure incurred on
advertisement and sales promotion was allowable under Section 37(1) of the
Act.
7\. The aforesaid decision has been affirmed by the Tribunal by the impugned
order which has dismissed the appeal filed by the Revenue. The Tribunal, while
doing so, has referred to the earlier decision in the case of the respondent-
assessee relating to Assessment Year 2009-10.
8\. The issue whether the respondent-assessee is entitled to deduction of
advertisement and sales promotion expenses under Section 37(1) of the Act is
covered against the Revenue by decision of this Court in Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax - III, (2015)
374 ITR 118 (Delhi) and Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Whirlpool of India
Ltd., (2016) 381 ITR 154 (Delhi). In Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India
Pvt. Ltd. (supra), a decision authored by one of us (Sanjiv Khanna, J.),
"Bright Line Method" has been disapproved and rejected.
9\. We have examined the Assessment Order and do not find any good ground and
reason given therein to treat advertisement and sales ITA No.1010/2018 Page 3
of 4 promotion expenses as a separate and independent international
transaction and not to regard and treat the said activity as a function
performed by the respondent-assessee, who was engaged in marketing and
distribution. Further, while segregating/debundling and treating advertisement

the Assessing Officer did not apportion the operating profit/income as
declared and accepted in respect of the international transactions.
10\. ITA No.213/2018 filed by the Revenue in the case of the respondent-
assessee against the order of the Tribunal for the Assessment Year 2009-10 was
dismissed by this Court vide order dated 20.2.2018. This order also records
that the respondent-assessee having suffered losses had closed its business in
India.

is covered by the afore-stated decisions. No costs.
