                                           ORDER
Per M.Balaganesh, AM
1\. These appeals of the assessee as well as the revenue arise out of the
proceedings for the Asst Years 2010-11 and 2011-12 of the Learned Dispute
Resolution Panel (DRP) dated 29.12.2014 and 16.12.2015 respectively in which
directions are given to the Learned AO u/s 144C(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). As some of the issues involved in both
the years are identical in nature, they are taken up together and disposed off
by this common order for the sake of convenience.
2\. At the outset, we would like to place on record our appreciation for the
assistance provided by the ld DR in disposal of these appeals. These cases
were listed for hearing on 14.8.2017 and was kept as part heard and further
adjourned to 16.8.2017. We are given to understand from the statement of the
ld DR that he had applied for Earned Leave from 16.8.2017. Since the counsel
for the assessee had come from New Delhi, the ld DR was gracious enough to be
present on 16.8.2017 for completion of these appeals after cancellation of his
sanctioned leave. The enthusiasm with which the ld DR co-operated with us for
expeditious disposal of these appeals richly deserves to be appreciated.
3\. The Ground No. 1 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 is
general in nature and does not require any specific adjudication. The Ground
No. 2 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 against the
confirmation of adjustment of Rs 1,87,48,901/- to the international
transactions of the assessee with its Associated Enterprises (AEs) is dealt
with independently in other grounds adjudicated herein below. Hence this
ground does not require any specific adjudication.

4\. Adjustment to Arm's Length Price - ITA No. 584/Kol/2015 (Assessee Appeal)
- Asst Year 2010-11 The assessee is a closely held company engaged in the
business of manufacturing and distribution of electric meters and related
components. It also renders software development services to its group
companies. In the course of its business operations, the assessee has entered
into certain international transactions. For the purpose of benchmarking the
prices of the international transactions, the assessee in its transfer pricing
report, segregated the above transactions into three broad segments
'Manufacturing' , 'Trading' and 'Service'. The particulars of the transaction
and the relevant segment to which it relates has been depicted below:-
Landis + Gyr Manufacturing segment Trading segment-Meters Service segment
Meters Software development Transaction Domestic Export Business Import of
Finished Goods Business Transactions Export of services Transactions-
Transactions-
    Import of raw materials    Sale of Finished Goods
    & components
4.1. In addition to the above transactions, the assessee has also entered into
following class of transactions being 'payment of royalty' , 'payment of
management service fees' and 'reimbursement of expenses'. The said
transactions being distinct class of  3 4 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 transactions have been benchmarked separately applying
the most appropriate method (MAM).
4.2. The international transactions entered into by the assessee under each of
the above depicted segments, have been summarized below:
    International Transactions of the       Segment of the              Amount (Rs.)

    Services
4.3. The ld AO based on the order passed by the ld TPO u/s 92 CA(3) of the Act
had made additions/disallowances against the international transactions
undertaken by the assessee as encompassed under the 'Manufacturing Segment -
Domestic', 'Manufacturing Segment - Export' and 'Trading Segment'. In
addition, the ld AO made adjustments in relation to the transaction of
'payment of royalty' and 'payment of management service fees' entered into by
the assessee with its AEs. All other international transactions of the
assessee have been determined to be at arm's length.
4.4. The assessee had benchmarked the international transactions of sale of
finished goods, purchase of raw materials and purchase of finished goods by
considering the transactional level profitability for each of the relevant
transaction. However, the ld  4 5 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 TPO ignored the transactional level analysis submitted by
the assessee and instead considered the entire Meter Segment (as reflected in
Accounting Standard -17 on 'Segment Reporting' disclosure in the audited
financial statements) to determine ALP of aforesaid transactions.
4.5. The assessee submitted that the turnover of the Meter Segment was Rs
194.07 crores as against the value of international transactions of only Rs
11.17 crores and accordingly it submitted that while benchmarking the
international transactions accounting for merely 5.76% ( 11.17 / 194.07 crores
* 100) of the entire Meter Segment, the ld TPO erred in considering the entire
Meter Segment margin which majorly includes third party business amounting to
Rs 182.90 crores i.e 94.24% of total meter segment.
4.6. The details of functional segment, tested party, transfer pricing method
and Profit Level Indicator (PLI) adopted by the assessee with respect to sale
of finished goods (manufacturing segment - export) ; purchase of raw material
/ finished goods (manufacturing segment - domestic) and purchase of finished
goods (trading segment) have been presented below:-
    Nature         of   Relevant          Most            Tested     Party Amounts (Rs.)

4.7. The assessee has submitted in its TP study report , the segmentation of
its business segments into manufacturing segment, trading segment and service
segment. Furhter,  5 6 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016
M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 the manufacturing segment was further classified into
'manufacturing for the domestic market' and 'manufacturing for the export
market' for transactions of purchase of raw material and sale of finished
goods respectively. Each of the aforesaid segments of the assessee is based on
uniqueness of functions performed and risks assumed. It submitted that the
activities undertaken and the international transactions proposed to be
benchmarked under the two segments are distinct from one another and hence the
assessee had benchmarked the activities separately in its TP study report.
5\. Sale of Finished Goods in Manufacturing Segment (Export) For the
manufacturing segment with two further sub-segments of domestic sales and
exports, the ld TPO found its bifurcation untenable because despite calling
two sub- segments as two separate ones, the assessee had merely divided
various costs on the basis of turnovers, except the Export Incentive and
Excise Duty which had been done on the actual basis. The cost of raw materials
and cost of manpower had merely been proportionately allocated. The ld TPO was
of the view that the combined Profit Level Indicator (PLI) would reflect a
more appropriate indicator.
5.1. The assessee had justified the Arm's Length nature of the aforesaid
international transactions selecting itself as the tested party wherein it
benchmarked the PLI (OP / Sales) using Transaction Net Margin Method (TNMM).
The benchmarking was done by the assessee by comparing its export segment net
profitability of 29.15% with uncontrolled comparable companies at 5.17%
operating in India and since the assessee's margin was more than the margin of
comparable companies, the transaction was determined to be at ALP.
5.2. The ld TPO accepted the selection of the tested party to be the assessee
itself. He also accepted the TNMM as the MAM and the PLI of OP / Sales as
chosen by the assessee. With regard to the benchmarking done by the assessee,
the ld TPO ignored  6 7 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016
M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 the relevant 'Manufacturing-Export Segment' (Rs 9.74
crores) profitability and considered the margin of 'entire meter segment' (Rs
194.07 crores) which also encompasses profit from third party transactions
accounting for 95% of the total segment. As a result, the ld TPO identified
comparable companies of his own to arrive at the arm's length margin of 15.61%
thereby arriving at adjustment of Rs 1,51,98,611/- . This action of the ld TPO
was approved by the ld Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP). Aggrieved, the assessee
is in appeal before us.
6\. Purchase of raw materials ( Manufacturing Segment - Domestic) The assessee
had justified the Arm's Length nature of the aforesaid international
transactions selecting the AEs as the tested party wherein it benchmarked the
PLI [(Gross Profit (GP) / Direct and Indirect Cost of Production (DICOP) ]
using Cost Plus Method (CPM). The benchmarking was done by the assessee by
comparing the AEs profitability from sale of materials to assessee with sale
of materials to similar companies operating in AEs region. As a result, the
assessee found that the margins earned by the AEs were lower than the
comparables' margin and accordingly the transaction was determined to be at
ALP.
6.1. The ld TPO selected the tested party to be the assessee itself. He
adopted the TNMM as the MAM and the PLI of OP / Sales . With regard to the
benchmarking done by the assessee, the ld TPO ignored the relevant
'Manufacturing-Domestic Segment' (Rs 1.07 crores) profitability and considered
the margin of 'entire meter segment' (Rs 194.07 crores) which also encompasses
profit from third party transactions accounting for 99.45% of the total
segment. As a result, the ld TPO identified comparable companies of his own to
arrive at the arm's length margin of 15.61% thereby arriving at adjustment of
Rs 16,64,527/- . This action of the ld TPO was approved by the ld Dispute
Resolution Panel (DRP). Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us.

7\. Purchase of finished goods (Trading Segment) The assessee had justified
the Arm's Length nature of the aforesaid international transactions selecting
itself as the tested party wherein it benchmarked the PLI (Gross
Profitability) using Resale Price Method (RPM). The benchmarking was done by
the assessee by comparing its Trading Segment Gross Profitability of 33.48%
with Gross Profitability of Uncontrolled Comparable Companies at 22.34%
operating in India and since the assessee's margin was more than the margin of
comparable companies, the transaction was determined to be at ALP. This
approach was even adopted by the ld TPO and ld DRP in assessee's own case for
the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09.
7.1. The ld TPO accepted the selection of the tested party to be the assessee
itself. He adopted the TNMM as the MAM and the PLI of OP / Sales. With regard
to the benchmarking done by the assessee, the ld TPO ignored the relevant
'Trading Segment (Rs 0.36 crores) profitability and considered the margin of
'entire meter segment' (Rs 194.07 crores) which also encompasses profit from
third party transactions accounting for 99.81% of the total segment. As a
result, the ld TPO identified comparable companies of his own to arrive at the
arm's length margin of 13.45% thereby arriving at adjustment of Rs 4,90,394/-
. This action of the ld TPO was approved by the ld Dispute Resolution Panel
(DRP). Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us.
8\. The ld TPO rejected the transactional level analysis and adopted entity
wide analysis for determination of ALP of international transactions. This
action of the ld TPO was approved by the ld Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP).
Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us.
9\. The ld AR argued that in transfer pricing analysis a transaction by
transaction approach should be undertaken for bench marking analysis to
determine the arm's length price of the international transactions being
entered into. The principle of  8 9 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 undertaking transaction by transaction analysis for
determination of arm's length price has been embedded under the Indian
Transfer Pricing Regulations, OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, 2010 updated
via Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan 8-10, 2015 (herein referred
to as 'OECD TP Guidelines') and UN TP Manual, 2013. He drew our attention to
Rule 10B(2) of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, which sets out the criteria for
comparability of the transactions, wherein in sub-rule (a) and (b) sets out as
under:-
(a) the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services
provided in either transaction ;
(b) the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be
employed and the risks assumed, by the respective parties to the transactions.
9.1. He submitted that the functions performed and risk assumed by the
assessee in case of the international transactions covered under the segments
i.e 'Manufacturing - Domestic Segment', 'Manufacturing - Export Segment' and
'Trading Segment' are distinct and separate from one another. It was explained
that with regard to 'Manufacturing-Domestic Segment' , the assessee undertakes
full-fledged marketing efforts to secure customer contracts. It has to ensure
appropriate application of licensed technology from the AE for manufacturing
of products to meet customer requirement and satisfaction. The assessee also
has to bear product performance risks towards end customers, in addition to
bearing the credit risk with respect to its domestic operations. Whereas under
'Manufacturing-Export Segment' the assessee receives product specification
from its AE and accordingly manufactures and supplies the product. It is not
liable to end customers for product performance. It is also not undertaking
any marketing efforts in the export market to secure contracts and does not
bear any credit risk as it receives payment from its AEs. Further with regard
to 'Trading Segment', the assessee purchases finished goods from AEs based on
orders received from the Indian customers. The assessee performs the role of
limited risk distributor for the said  9 10 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 activity. The assessee bears indirect market risk as it
is only being remunerated for limited risk distribution activity.
9.2. He argued that these functional and risk differences arising under the
different segments were completely overlooked by the ld TPO and ld DRP. He
further argued that with regard to sub-segments of Manufacturing Segment, the
fact that market dynamics and economic circumstances of the Export and
Domestic market cannot be compared due to varied factors. Further, the Export
market is likely to have a different realization from the Domestic market and
therefore the two sub-segments cannot be compared for analysis purposes.
9.3. He again reiterated that the total value of international transactions
was only Rs 11.17 crores (i.e sale of finished goods (export) - Rs 9.74 crores
; purchase of raw materials and components in Manufacturing - Domestic segment
- Rs 1.07 crores and purchase of finished goods in Trading Segment - Rs 0.36
crores) , whereas the value of entire Meter Segment sales was Rs 194.07
crores. He argued that how can the profitability from entire sales value of Rs
194.07 crores would be a better reflection of Rs 11.17 crores of transaction
value rather than profitability determined from Rs 11.17 crores transaction
value itself. He submitted that the segmentation undertaken by the assessee
was to achieve greater functional comparability and the benchmarking was also
undertaken keeping in mind the specific characteristics of the international
transactions captured within the relevant segments as per Rule 10B(2) of the
Rules.
9.4. In the context of comparability and FAR analysis, he placed reliance on
the following paras of OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, 2010 updated via Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan 8-10, 2015 (herein referred to as
'OECD TP Guidelines') since the Indian Transfer Pricing law is largely based
on the principles and technicalities laid down in these guidelines :-
10 11
> ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 D.1.2. Functional analysis Para 1.51. " In transactions
> between two independent enterprises, compensation usually will reflect the
> functions that each enterprise performs (taking into account assets used and
> risks assumed). Therefore, in delineating the controlled transaction and
> determining comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions
> or entities, a functional analysis is necessary. This functional analysis
> seeks to identify the economically significant activities and
> responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed
> by the parties to the transactions. ........................... "
9.5. He submitted that the ld TPO had failed to decipher that FAR analysis is
one of the critical factors in establishing the ALP of the international
transaction and reiterated the fact that functions undertaken and risks
assumed for the aforesaid international transactions are completely different
and hence a collective benchmarking analysis for the same would distort the
principles of transfer pricing and will render the comparison defective. He
stated that where the international transaction could be specifically related
to a particular business segment of the assessee and the segmented result with
respect to such segments could be obtained, use of segmented profitability
would provide a better and more scientific method for determining the arm's
length operations of the company rather than adopting an overall /entity level
TNMM approach.
9.6. The ld AR also submitted that as per para 2.78 of Chapter II - Transfer
Pricing Methods of the OECD TP Guidelines under the caption 'Determination of
Net Profit', it is stated as under:-
> Para B.3.3. - Determination of the net profit " 2.78. Costs and revenues
> that are not related to the controlled transaction under review should be
> excluded where they materially affect comparability with  11 12 ITA Nos.584
> & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 uncontrolled transactions. An appropriate level of
> segmentation of the taxpayer's financial data is needed when determining or
> testing the net profit it earns from a controlled transction (or from
> transactions that are appropriately aggregated according to the guidance at
> paragraphs 3.9 - 3.12). Therefore, it would be inappropriate to apply the
> transactional net margin method on a company wide basis if the company
> engages in a variety of different controlled transactions that cannot be
> appropriately compared on an aggregate basis with those of an independent
> enterprise."
9.7. Accordingly the ld AR submitted that the assessee had carried out the
benchmarking exercise based on the segmental profitability and the segmental
statement reflects the profitability under relevant segments being
'Manufacturing- Domestic' , 'Manufacturing- Export' and 'Trading Segment'. The
assessee had considered the profitability from the relevant segment and
benchmarked the same with the companies engaged in similar activities. On the
basis of such analysis, the price of international transactions of purchase of
materials & components, sale of finished goods and purchase of finished goods
were determined to be at arm's length. He also submitted that as per Rule
10B(1) of the Rules comprising of different methods of determination of ALP,
the price / profit earned from the relevant international transaction should
be tested. In this regard, he also placed reliance on the OECD TP Guidelines
in para 3.9 of the document wherein it was stated as under:
> 3.9 Ideally, in order to arrive at the most precise approximation of arm's
> length conditions, the arm's length principle should be applied on a
> transaction-by-transaction basis. However, there are often situations where
> separate transactions are so closely linked or continuous that they cannot
> be evaluated adequately on a separate basis....
9.8. The ld AR also placed reliance on the United Nations TP Manual vide para
B.2.3.1.11 of the document which states as under:-
> Evaluation of separate and combined transactions  12 13 ITA Nos.584 &
> 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 " B.2.3.1.11. The transfer pricing analysis should

> approach would not lead to a reliable result. Where transactions are so
> closely interrelated or continuous that application of the arm's length
> principle on a transaction-by-transaction basis would become unreliable or
> cumbersome, transactions are often aggregated for the purposes of the
> analysis.".
9.9. The ld AR argued that it could be observed from the above readings of
International Guidelines that both OECD TP Guidelines and UN TP Manual have
given primary preference to undertake a transaction by transaction analysis.
It is only under certain exceptional circumstances, where separate transaction
level analysis could not be undertaken or separate transactions are so closely
inter-linked , that aggregation of transaction approach has been warranted.
However, in the instant case, each of the transactions undertaken by the
assessee on which TP adjustment has been imputed were distinct, independent
and warrant separate analysis to determine the arm's length price. Like for
instance, in sale of finished goods, the assessee manufactures and sells the
goods based on the specification received from the AE wherein it does not
undertake any marketing efforts nor does it bear any credit risk as it
receives payment from its AEs. Whereas, with respect to purchase of
components, the assessee needs to ensure that those are appropriately used in
its manufacturing process to produce goods with desirable performance quality
and meet end customers requirement. Thus, the two primary impugned
transactions i.e sale of finished goods and purchase of raw materials are
separate and distinct from each other and do require a separate transaction
level analysis to determine arm's length price. In support of his contention,
he placed reliance on the Co-ordinate Bench decision of Delhi Tribunal in the
case of Benetton India (P) Ltd vs ITO reported in (2012) 134 ITD 229 (Delhi
Trib.) wherein it was held that :-
> 7 ... The first and foremost question in this case is to determine whether
> the action of TPO in undertaking entity level bench marking by TNM method
> combining all the international transactions is justifiable or the TP
> analysis provided by assessee, based on "transaction to transaction" basis

Consideration of transaction by transaction approach for determination of the
arm's length price has also been upheld in the following mentioned judicial
precedents:

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 9.10. The ld AR also submitted that the consideration of
transaction by transaction approach had been upheld by this tribunal in
assessee's own case for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 in ITA Nos. 37 &
1623/Kol/2012 respectively dated 3.8.2016.
10\. In response to this, the ld DR stated that the sale of finished goods in
'Manufacturing Segment- Export' ; purchase of raw materials & components in
'Manufacturing Segment - Domestic' are all interlinked and closely related
with each other and for this purpose only, payment of royalty is also made by
the assessee. The segmental bifurcation made by the assessee between two
different segments have been duly rejected by the ld TPO as the basis of
allocation of costs thereon was not properly done by the assessee. Even the
United Nations TP Manual in para B.2.3.1.11 relied upon by the ld AR supports
the case of the revenue in the facts of the instant case as the subject
mentioned international transactions are closely related and hence only entity
level approach would yield the desirable results for determination of ALP. He
also stated that the AE profitability cannot be considered for benchmarking
the profitability of international transactions carried out by the assessee.
He stated that the provisions of the Act provides for adoption of bundled /
composite approach for determination of ALP of international transactions. The
assessee had merely camouflouged the entire gamut of transactions by
bifurcating into different segments which are not at all required in the
instant case. In support of his argument that bundled approach is permitted,
he placed reliance on the OECD Guidelines under the caption 'Evaluation of a
taxpayer's separate and combined transactions' in para 3.9 and 3.11 thereon
which are reproduced hereunder:-
> "3.9 Ideally, in order to arrive at the most precise approximation of arm's

In the instant case, the closely linked transactions of each international
transaction are clearly established . He argued that the assessee had
segregated the risks in page 187 of the paper book between Manufacturing-
Domestic and Manufacturing -Export , which is not at all required. The
assessee would not be floating separate tenders for Domestic or Export
business. He also placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India (P) Ltd vs CIT
reported in (wherein bundled approach was permitted. ) 374 ITR 118 (Del)
wherein the principle of bundled approach had been accepted by the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court.
11\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available
on record including the paper books filed by the assessee. We find that the
growing importance of international trade, globalization and rapid rise in the
number of Multinational  16 17 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Enterprises (MNEs) has resulted in exhaustive and
meticulous research and studies in this complex area of determination of
transfer price and shifting of profits from one country to another country
pursuant to transactions with AEs. The transfer pricing methods have seen a
measure of standardization, universal recognition and acceptability. Indian
transfer pricing regulations have adopted and benefitted, from the
international framework. The OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines for MNEs and tax
administration and United Nations' Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing do
reflect the international understanding on several aspects relating to
transfer pricing. We have taken note of the saem and had referred to the two
guidelines as it is found to be conducive and helpful in deciding the issues.
11.1. Sub-section (1) to Section 92 states that any income arising from an
international transaction shall be computed having regard to arm's length
price. It includes expense or interest arising from an international
transaction. Sub-Section (2) is an adjunct and intrinsically connected with
Sub- Section (1) to Section 92. It stipulates that Sub- Section (1) shall be
applicable when two or more AEs enter into a mutual agreement or arrangement
for allocation, apportionment or contribution to any cost, expense incurred or
to be incurred in connection with benefit, service or facility provided or to
be provided. An international transaction, therefore, means transaction
between two or more AEs when either one or both are non-resident; the
transaction should be in nature of sale, purchase or lease of tangible or
intangible property or in the nature of provision for services or lending of
money or any other transaction having bearing on the profits, income, losses
or assets. A mutual agreement or arrangement for allocation of expenses would
also be an international transaction. Section 92F defines the term
"transaction" broadly and is a very wide definition, and we observe, that
clause (v) thereof stipulates that an arrangement, understanding or action in
concert would be a transaction whether or not such arrangements, etc. are
formal or in writing or whether or not such  17 18 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015
ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 arrangements are legally enforceable. From the above, we
find that the definition of 'transaction' in section 92F(v) of the Act is an
inclusive definition. We also find that Rule 10A(d) of the Rules defines
'transaction' as under:-
'Transaction' includes a number of closely linked transactions.
11.2. The determination of ALP vis a vis the assessment of real income under
the Act had been discussed elaborately in the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India (P) Ltd vs
CIT reported in (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del) wherein it was held :-
> 77\. As a concept and principle Chapter X does not artificially broaden,
> expand or deviate from the concept of "real income". "Real income", as held
> by the Supreme Court in Poona Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. v. CIT [1965] 57
> ITR 521, means profits arrived at on commercial principles, subject to the
> provisions of the Act. Profits and gains should be true and correct profits
> and gains, neither under nor over stated. Arm's length price seeks to
> correct distortion and shifting of profits to tax the actual income earned
> by a resident/domestic AE. The profit which would have accrued had arm's
> length conditions prevailed is brought to tax. Misreporting, if any, on
> account of non- arm's length conditions resulting in lower profits, is
> corrected.
11.3. The assessee had undertaken the transactional level analysis which has
been rejected by the ld TPO and ld DRP. We find that while undertaking the
transactional level analysis, the assessee had submitted the copy of certified
segmental statement reflecting profitability earned by it under its various
segments being 'Manufacturing- Domestic', 'Manufacturing-Export' and 'Trading'
Segment, which is as under:-
18 19
> ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 However, the ld TPO rejected the segmental statement
stating that the broad segmentation of manufacturing and trading is not backed
by any documentary evidence and it is a far-fetched approach. Further, it
raised various other apprehensions being:-
(i) basis of allocation of expenses is not justifiable as direct cost
allocation is higher in case of domestic segment as against export segment
(ii) segmental statement is not part of the audited financial accounts.
11.4. The assessee had addressed the aforesaid apprehensions in the following
manner:-
(i) Basis of allocation of expenses is not justifiable The assessee submitted
that the segmental analysis has considered all direct costs apportionment on
actual basis and indirect costs apportioned on sales basis. The direct costs
incurred with respect to each segment which forms nearly 50% of total costs
has  19 20 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis +
Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 been identified on actual basis. It is only the indirect
overheads wherein one to one mapping of expense could not be ascertained has
been allocated on the size of the activity in each segment. Hence the ld TPO's
contention that direct cost allocation has been higher in case of domestic
segment as against export segment is not warranted as allocation has been on
actual basis.
(ii) Segmental statement is not part of audited financial accounts The
assessee submitted that there is no statutory requirement of maintaining a
separate segmental accounts reflecting profitability earned by the assessee
from its international transactions. The Accounting Standard (AS) 17 issued by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) requires reporting of
financial information or result about the different types of products or
services that the business segment produces and there is no requirement of
reporting details for transaction with related parties and unrelated parties
separately. In addition, there is no statutory requirement of the segmental
accounts of being audited or certified by any independent agency and neither
these are required to be part of audited financial statements. However, the
assessee still submitted the copy of segmental accounts certified by an
independent Chartered Accountant before the ld TPO / ld DRP.
11.5. We find that the reliance has been placed by the ld DR on the decision
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications India (P) Ltd vs CIT reported in (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del) for
adoption of bundled approach, wherein it was held as under:-
> G. Section 92(3) of the Act and Bundled/Inter-Connected Transactions
> 79\. At this stage and before we examine the TNM Method exhaustively, we
> deem it necessary to interpret and refer to in some detail sub-section (1)
> to Section 92C and reference to the term 'transaction' with the vowel 'an',
> which has been interpreted by the majority judgment of the Tribunal to mean
> a single independent transaction and not a  20 21 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015
> ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 group or bundle of transactions. We do not think that use
of vowel 'an' or the word 'transaction' instead of the word 'transactions'
should be given undue notability and prominence. One of the primary rules of
statutory construction is that singular includes plural and vice-versa. This
rule applies unless a contrary intention is manifest and exhibited. Merely
because a statutory provision is drafted in singularity as opposed to
plurality, is not enough to exclude application of the general rule that
singular includes plural. The rule is not to be discarded on the ground that
the relevant provision is singular or plural and the subsidiary and ancillary
provision follow the same pattern. Contrary intention to exclude this generic
rule is not to be lightly inferred. Contrary intention is not assumed or
formed by confining attention to a specific provision but it would be apposite
to consider the provision in the setting and placement of the legislation. It
is a substance and tenure of the statute which would be meaningfully and
critically determinative. This is the mandate of Section 13(2) of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 (see Newspapers Ltd. v. State Industrial Tribunal AIR 1957
SC 532, Narshimha Murthy v.Susheelabai [1996] 4 SCC 644, J. Jayalalitha v.
Union of India [1999] 5 SCC 138, Blue Metal Industries Ltd. v. RW Dilley
[1960] 3 All ER 437, Floor v. Davis Inspector of Taxes [1979] 2 All ER 677,
Sin Pon Amalgamated (H.K.) Ltd. v. Attorny General [1965] 1 All ER 225 (PC)
80\. The use of expression 'class of transaction', 'functions performed by the
parties' in Section 92C(1) illustrates to the contrary, that the word
'transaction' can never include and would exclude bundle or group of connected
transactions. More important would be reference to meaning of the term
'transaction' in Section 92F, clause (v), which as per the said definition
includes an arrangement or understanding or action in concert whether or not
the same is formal or in writing, whether or not it is intended to be
enforceable by legal proceedings. Rule 10A in clause (d) states that "for the
purpose of this Rule and Rules 10AB and 10E", the term 'transaction' would
"include a number of closely linked transactions". This Rule in positive terms
declares that the legislative intent is not to deviate from the generic rule
that singular includes plural. The meaning or definition of the expression
'transaction' in clause (d) to Rule 10A read with sub- section (1) to Section
92C, therefore, does not bar or prohibit clubbing of closely connected or
intertwined or continuous transactions. This is discernible also from sub-
rule (2) to Rule 10B quoted above. The sub-rule refers to 'services provided',
'functions performed', 'contractual terms (whether or not such terms are
formal or in writing) of the transactions' which lay down explicitly or
impliedly the responsibilities, risks and benefits to be divided between the
respective parties to the transactions. Use of plurality by way of necessity
and legislative mandate is evident in the said Rule.
81\. Similarly, sub-rule (3) to Rule 10B refers to transactions being compared
or comparison of the enterprises entering into such transactions likely to
affect the price or cost charged etc. A reading of Rule 10C reassures and
affirms that the general principle of plurality is not abandoned or discarded.
82\. There is considerable tax literature and text that CUP Method, i.e.
Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method, RP Method, i.e. Resale Price Method and
CP Method, i.e. Cost Plus Method can be applied to a transaction or closely
linked, or continuous  21 22 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 transactions. Profits Split Method and TNM Method grouped
as 'transactional profit methods', can be equally effective and reliable when
applied to closely linked or continuous transactions. Thus, it would be
inappropriate to proceed with the arm's length computation methods, with a
pre-conceived suppositions on singularity as a statutory mandate. Clubbing of
closely linked, which would include continuous transactions, may be
permissible and not ostracized. Aggregation of closely linked transactions or
segregation by the assessed should be tested by the Assessing Officer/TPO on
the benchmark and the exemplar; whether such aggregation/ segregation by the
assessed should be interfered in terms of the four clauses stipulated in
Section 92C(3) of the Act, read with the Rules. It would, among other aspects,
refer to the method adopted and whether reliability and authenticity of the
arm's length determination is affected or corrupted.
83\. We now proceed to examine the TNM Method, whether there is prohibition in
applying this method on entity to entity basis, and if not, when is it
permissible to apply entity to entity comparison. The discussion would also
answer the question, when is clubbing or bunching or transactions permissible
in TNM Method.
11.6. Hence it could be seen from the underlined portions of the aforesaid
judgment, the Hon'ble Court was only trying to concur with the adoption of
bundled approach as an exception by stating that it is also permissible and
accepted. But the Hon'ble Court had stated the same with a rider that the said
approach should be tested on the benchmarking done on the various transactions
of the assessee in terms of four clauses stipulated in section 92C(3) of the
Act read with the Rules. Hence it could be safely concluded that the bundled
approach could be adopted only after passing the test contemplated above and
it is not automatic application or it is not the mandate of law. The bundled
approach, in our considered opinion, was only stated as one of the permissible
methods depending upon the international transactions of the assessee with its
AEs. In the instant case, the assessee had undertaken the transactional level
analysis by considering the certified segmental statement profitability earned
by it under its various segments being 'Manufacturing-Domestic',
'Manufacturing-Export' and 'Trading' Segment. Infact we find that the
arguments of the ld DR are duly answered in para 3.9 of the OECD Transfer
Pricing Guidelines for MNEs and Tax Administrations in Chapter III which are
reproduced hereinabove. It states that only in the event of assessee not able
22 23 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr
Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 to benchmark the transactions independently, then bundled
approach could be adopted. In the instant case, the assessee was able to
prepare the segmental profitability statement for each of its segments and
prove the ALP thereon with respect to its comparables. Hence we hold that the
said approach should be adopted in the place of bundled approach adopted by
the ld TPO / ld DRP. Accordingly, we hold that the reliance placed by the ld
DR on the decision of Sony Ericsson supra does not advance the case of the
revenue. In any case, the aggregation is to be done only for international
transactions and not for domestic transactions as has been done in the instant
case by the ld TPO. We find lot of force in the argument of the ld AR that the
ld TPO had accepted Resale Price Method for purchase of finished goods
(Trading segment) in Asst Year 2011-12 (which will be dealt separately in this
order) and hence the same could not have been bundled. The total value of
international transactions in three segments is only Rs 11.17 crores out of
total turnover of the entire meter segment of Rs 194.07 crores which works out
to only 5.75% and the remaining 94.25% represents domestic transactions. Hence
the comparison based on aggregation of both domestic and international
transactions would only project distorted figures and would result in
absurdity. We also place reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High
Court in the case of Tara Jewels Exports Pvt Ltd reported in
TS-481-HC-2015(BOM)-TP wherein it was held that international transactions
only are to be considered for purpose of PLI computation. Similar decision was
rendered by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in yet another case of Syscom
Corporation Ltd reported in TS-808-HC-2016(BOM)-TP wherein it was held that TP
adjustment is to be restricted only to international transaction.
11.7. We also find that in Asst Year 2007-08 in assessee's own case in ITA No.
37 /Kol/2012 dated 3.8.2016 , this tribunal had held as under:-
> 5.2.13. We find that the ld DRP failed to understand the benchmarking

11.8. We also find that in Asst Year 2008-09 in assessee's own case in ITA No.
1623/Kol/2012 dated 3.8.2016, this tribunal had held as under:-
> 6.3.1. .................................

> General Motors India Pvt Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2013) 146 ITD 559 (Ahd

11.9. The ld AR also pointed out that the revenue had not preferred any
further appeal to the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court against the order of this
tribunal for the Asst Years  24 25 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 2007-08 and 2008-09 and hence as such the matter had
reached finality and revenue had accepted the verdict of this tribunal in
assessee's own case. Hence we hold that the certified segmental statement
reflecting separate profitability under different segments are to be
considered for the purpose of benchmarking the transaction of (i) sale of
finished goods , (ii) purchase of materials and components and (iii) purchase
of finished goods. Accordingly, the Ground No. 3 raised by the assessee for
Asst Year 2010- 11 is allowed.
12\. Sale of Finished Goods - Manufacturing Export Segment During the
Financial Year 2009-10, the assessee manufactured and sold electric meters and
components worth Rs. 194.07 crores out of which goods worth Rs. 9.74 crores
were exported to AE. The details of the same are enclosed in page 1296 of Part
3 of the Paper Book. For the purpose of determination of Arm's Length Price ,
the assessee undertook a detailed functional analysis and determined itself to
be a tested party to the transaction. The assessee undertook segmental level
profitability analysis to determine the profit earned from export of finished
goods. The assessee also submitted a certified copy of the segmental
profitability analysis before the ld TPO and ld DRP. On evaluation of the
methods prescribed under the TP regulations, the assessee considered TNMM as
the MAM and OP/Sales as the most appropriate PLI, which has been accepted by
the ld TPO / ld DRP. Thereafter, the assessee undertook a scientific search
process to identify uncontrolled comparable companies having a reasonable
level of revenue from export sales. The details of the same are enclosed in
page 187 of the Paper Book.
12.1. Twelve comparable companies were identified to be dealing in
manufacturing of meter business having substantial level of export sales by
the assessee. The margins for the comparable companies have been erroneously
computed by the ld TPO and hence the correct margins as computed from the
audited financial statements have been  25 26 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 considered by the assessee. On comparing the average
OP/Sales of these comparable companies at 5.17% based on single year data with
OP/Sales earned by the assessee at 29.15% from sale of finished goods under
the 'Manufacturing-Export Segment', the transaction value was determined to be
at arm's length. The details of the same are available in page 195 of Vol. I
read together with page 1296 of Vol. III of the Paper Book. We also find that
similar decision was rendered in assessee's own case, on due appreciation of
similar facts, by this tribunal for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 in ITA
Nos. 37 & 1623/Kol/2012 dated 3.8.2016 for considering the segmental level
profitability as submitted by the assessee for determining the ALP of this
international transaction. The ld AR also pointed out that the revenue had not
preferred any further appeal to the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court against the
order of this tribunal for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 and hence as
such the matter had reached finality and revenue had accepted the verdict of
this tribunal in assessee's own case. Hence we hold that the value of export
sales of finished goods of the assessee under 'Manufacturing Segment - Export'
is at arm's length and no adjustment is warranted thereon. Accordingly the
Ground No. 5 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 is allowed.
13\. Purchase of materials / components - 'Manufacturing Segment - Domestic'
With respect to the above, an adjustment computed as a percentage of
transaction value to the total costs of the Meter Segment was undertaken by
the ld TPO. The value of purchase of materials / components from its AE was Rs
1,06,57,099/- (Rs 1.07 crores) which works out to 0.55% of total turnover of
meter segment of Rs 194.07 crores. We find that the assessee is trying to
justify its Arm's length price by following transaction- by-transaction
approach, encompassed in its 'Manufacturing Domestic' segment, by selecting
CPM as the MAM and selecting its AEs as the tested party. The PLI adopted by
the assessee was GP / DICOP. The assessee had benchmarked the margins retained
by AEs by supplying the materials and components to the assessee with
companies  26 27 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s
Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 engaged in similar activities, details of which are
enclosed in pages 195 to 198 of Part 1 of Paper Book. The assessee has
submitted the economic analysis for the consideration of the lower authorities
, wherein AEs were selected as tested party for the analysis and profitability
retained by them were benchmarked. The assessee provided the ld TPO with the
details of margins earned by the AEs on supply of materials to the assessee.
Accordingly, the comparable companies were identified and arithmetic mean was
computed. The prices of such transfer of materials and components wre
determined to be at arm's length.
13.1. Detailed benchmarking analysis as submitted before the ld DRP and ld TPO
has been provided by the assessee in pages 240-251 of Part 1 of Paper Book. A
summary of the said benchmarking study has been provided herein below:-
    Pricing             Arm's length       Pricing methodology Arm's length Price
    methodology         Price of the       followed by Landis of the comparable
    followed   by       comparable         Greece              companies in Greece
    Landis USA          companies in                           region
                        US region
    GP/DICOP       - GP/DICOP        -     GP/DICOP - 4.81%            GP/DICOP - 50.26%
    5.26%            40.80%
The margin retained by AEs of the assessee were less than the margin earned by
comparable companies in their region and accordingly the transaction price of
supply of materials and components to assessee was determined to have been
undertaken at arm's length by the AE.
13.2. However, the ld TPO rejected the aforesaid benchmarking analysis and in
the remand report dated 18.12.2014 mentioned the following points fo rejection
:-
a. stating that information available from the certificates runs contrary to
the claim of the assessee regarding AEs suffering loss in respect of their
transaction with AEs .
27 28
ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 It was explained that the ld TPO erred in computing
margin on sales as against margin on cost computed by the assessee.
b. database of foreign companies is not available to ld TPO's office, hence
veracity of data could not be verified.
It was explained that merely because the access to foreign databases is not
available with the ld TPO, the same could not be considered as a reasonable
cause to reject the foreign comparable companies.
13.3. We find from the above that the ld TPO had failed to bring anything
concrete on records to negate the assessee's approach of determining the ALP
of purchase of materials and components from its AEs. We also find that the
aforementioned benchmarking analysis of considering the AEs as tested party
and benchmarking their margins (earned from sael of materials to assessee)
with the margins of comparable companies in AEs region, has been upheld by
this tribunal, on due appreciation of the similar facts, in assessee's own
case for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 vide order dated 3.8.2016 wherein
it was held :-
> 5.2.12. We find that in the transfer pricing analysis with respect to
> purchase of materials, the ld TPO had continued to select assessee as the
> tested party for imports of raw materials of Rs. 2.31 crores which is
> consumed in the manufacturing segment with a turnover of Rs. 90.45 crores.
> The margin earned from the entire segment cannot be a representation of
> 2.55% of the international transaction encompassed therein. Hence the
> selection of the assessee as the tested party would result in an abnormal
> outcome in the transfer pricing adjustments. The same could be observed from
> the fact that post applying TNMM, the ld TPO produced an outcome wherein the
> value of TP adjustment (as initially arrived of Rs. 8.90 crores) was
> determined to be more than the value of international transactions of Rs.
> 4.25 crores which is practically not possible. Therefore, to cover up the

> transfer of materials and components were determined to be at Arm's Length.
> The detailed benchmarking analysis as submitted before the ld DRP and ld TPO
> is enclosed in pages 211 to 227 of the Paper book. However, we find that the
> ld TPO in his remand report dated 8.8.2011 had rejected the analysis on the
> following grounds (vide pages 228 to 236 of the Paper Book) :-
> ....................................
> 5.2.13. We find that the ld DRP failed to understand the benchmarking
> approach as submitted by the assessee. The ld DRP did not recognize the fact
> that assessee was comparing AEs margin with comparable companies in AEs
> region rather than comparing the latter with assessee's margin earned in
> India (vide page 316 of the Paper Book). Thus the ld DRP summarily rejected
> the transaction by transaction approach adopted by the assessee. We find
> that the revenue had not brought anything concrete on records either
> factually or legally to negate the assessee's approach of determining the
> Arm's Length Transaction Price.
The ld AR also pointed out that the revenue had not preferred any further
appeal to the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court against the order of this tribunal
for the Asst Years 2007- 08 and 2008-09 and hence as such the matter had
reached finality and revenue had accepted the verdict of this tribunal in
assessee's own case. Accordingly we hold that the transactions of purchase of
raw materials and components carried out by the assessee was at arm's length.
Accordingly, the Ground No. 4(a) raised by the assessee for the Asst Year
2010-11 is allowed.
14\. Purchase of finished goods - Trading Segment  29 30 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 We find that the assessee had justified the Arm's Length
nature of the aforesaid international transactions selecting itself as the
tested party wherein it benchmarked the PLI (Gross Profitability) using Resale
Price Method (RPM). The benchmarking was done by the assessee by comparing its
Trading Segment Gross Profitability of 33.48% with Gross Profitability of
Uncontrolled Comparable Companies at 22.34% operating in India and since the
assessee's margin was more than the margin of comparable companies, the
transaction was determined to be at ALP. This approach was even adopted by the
ld TPO and ld DRP in assessee's own case for the Asst Years 2007-08 and
2008-09. There is no dispute on the selection of assessee itself as the the
tested party. The dispute is with regard to the adoption of MAM and PLI by the
ld TPO . The ld TPO adopted TNMM as the MAM and PLI of OP/Sales. With regard
to the benchmarking done by the assessee, the ld TPO ignored the relevant
'Trading Segment (Rs 0.36 crores) profitability and considered the margin of
'entire meter segment' (Rs 194.07 crores) which also encompasses profit from
third party transactions accounting for 99.81% of the total segment. The ld
TPO considered the profitability of comparable companies from database and
imputed adjustment as the profitability earned by the assessee under the
trading segment was lower than the average industry margin. We find that this
tribunal in assessee's own case for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 vide
its order dated 3.8.2016 had directed to consider the profitability of the
comparable companies from audited financial statements for more authenticity
of the data and compute the average margin accordingly. If the same is done,
then the transaction was determined to be at arm's length as the profitability
earned by the assessee under the trading segment was higher than the average
industry margin. We also find that the ld TPO had combined the trading segment
with the manufacturing segment of the assessee to separately benchmark the
transaction of purchase of finished goods. In doing so, we find that the ld
TPO had contradicted his own stand from earlier years of considering the
profitability of relevant segment (i.e for benchmarking the transaction
encompassed under that segment) and ended up considering the combined
profitability from both  30 31 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 manufacturing and trading operations for the analysis. We
find that the average margin of comparable companies chosen by the ld TPO was
22.34% based on single year data, whereas assessee's margin was 33.48% using
RPM as the MAM. The average margin of comparable companies chosen by the ld
TPO using TNMM as the MAM was 6.93%. Hence in any case, we find that the
assessee's margin of 33.48% was higher than the average industry margin of
comparable companies. Hence we hold that no adjustment is warranted to the ALP
determined by the assessee in respect of purchase of finished goods.
Accordingly, the Ground No. 4(b) raised by the assessee for the Asst Year
2010-11 is allowed.
15\. The Ground Nos. 6 & 7 raised by the assessee were stated to be not
pressed during the course of hearing. The same is reckoned as a statement from
the Bar and accordingly the Ground Nos. 6 & 7 raised by the assessee for the
Asst Year 2010-11 are dismissed as not pressed.
16\. Disallowance of Depreciation on Intellectual Property Rights The assessee
is a closely held company engaged in the business of manufacturing and
distribution of electric meters and related components. The assessee had been
a manufacturer and supplier of electro-mechanical meters till 2005 while the
market had migrated from electro-mechanical meters to static meters due to
availability of anti tampering features and communication facilities in static
meters. It also did not have any dedicated Research & Development wing to
support any electronic business. The Central Electricity Authority vide its
notification no. 502/70/CEA/DP&D dated 17.3.2006 notified the Central
Electricity Authority (Installation and operation of meters) Regulations, 2006
which inter alia, provided that all interface meters, consumer meters and
energy accounting and audit meters shall be of static type. The meters not
complying with these regulations were to be replaced as per the direction of
the Central  31 32 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s
Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Electricity Authority. Faced with this challenge ,
assessee wanted to quickly set up its R&D department and acquire some of the
intellectual property in this field. Accordingly, it acquired a sole
proprietorship unit named "Technology & Research - STPI (TECRES)" vide
Business Transfer Agreement dated 12.11.2006. The sole proprietorship concern
was run by Mr. Guljeet Singh Gandhi ( an unrelated party to the assessee). Mr
Gandhi through his business unit named TECRES had developed certain metering
related software and was engaged in the business of sale (both domestic and
export) of such software along with related services. Research and development
expenses were incurred in the said business. Mr Gandhi and his personnel
through their technical intelligence and expertise developed know-how for
producing metering related softwares. Since TECRES possessed the requisite
know-how, a key to survival in the market for static meters, the assessee
entered into Business Transfer Agreement for acquisition of business of
TECRES. The entire team of the said TECRES along with their developed codes
and domain repository had joined the assessee pursuant to the Business
Transfer Agreement. The intellectual property rights acquired by the assessee
consisted of designs, software, data base, research and development material
and facility, technical know-how, process know-how , confidential information,
basic and detailed drawings, operation and maintenance manuals relating to the
business carried out by TECRES. The ld AO observed that the Income Tax Rules
recognizes intangible assets such as knowhow, patents, copyrights, trademarks,
licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar
nature and these assets must possess certain certification / authenticity /
sanctity and or recognition from Government or from competent authority. He
further observed that the nature of the IP assets acquired by the assessee
does not fall in any of the category or similar nature as mentioned in IT
Rules. Therefore, he held that the assets are not intangible assets eligible
for depreciation and disallowed the claim of Rs. 60,53,906/- on the opening
written down value of intellectual property assets. This disallowance was
upheld by the  32 33 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s
Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 ld DRP on the ground that similar disallowance had been
made for Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 in assessee's own case. Aggrieved, the
assessee is in appeal before us.
16.1. The ld AR argued that the ld AO erred in alleging that the intellectual
property needs to have recognition from government and does not fall in any of
the category of intangible assets as mentioned in the Income Tax Rules and
accordingly denied the claim of depreciation. He argued that the TECRES, which
was taken over from Mr. Gandhi had total assets of Rs 40.17 lakhs and current
liabilities of Rs. 4.69 lakhs, was evaluated at Rs. 4.92 crores wherein the
major share of the consideration was attributed towards the intellectual
property the said business possessed. The entire team together with the domain
knowledge had been transferred to the assessee pursuant to the agreement. The
same had been used by the assessee for its very survival in the business of
static meters to be in line with the regulations of the Central Electricity
Authority and hence the use of intellectual property for the purpose of
business had been duly demonstrated by the assessee. He argued that the
allegation of the ld DRP is without any basis by ignoring the fact that the
knowhow in the instant case has been actually acquired by paying a
consideration of Rs.4.92 crores (pursuant to independent valuation by an
expert) to Mr Gandhi pursuant to business transfer agreement. He argued that
the provisions of the Act in more than one section had, in its wisdom, had
defined intangible assets as knowhow, patents, copyrights, trademarks,
licenses , franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar
nature. Hence knowhow is an independent item of intangible asset. Similarly
patent is an independent item of intangible asset. The ld DRP had erred in
mixing the term patent with knowhow and observed that since the knowhow
acquired had not been registered with Indian Government and hence the same
does not have any recognition from Government and accordingly does not fall in
the category of intangible assets. He further argued that there is no mandate
in the law that the knowhow needs to be registered with the Indian  33 34 ITA
Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Government to fall under the category of intangible asset
for claiming depreciation u/s 32 of the Act.
16.2. The Learned DR argued that the IP's acquired by the assessee have not
been approved by any authority and hence not recognized by the Indian
Government. Hence the claim of purchase of IP from a private unrelated entity
is merely a self serving statement and not supported by any evidences. He
further argued that the unit having assets of just Rs 40.17 lakhs had been
given a fancy valuation of Rs. 4.92 crores which is very unlikely. Moreover,
the components of assets predominantly comprised of computers worth Rs 1.93
lakhs and Software of Rs 1.34 lakhs, Furniture of Rs. 10.84 lakhs , Car of Rs.
8.56 lakhs, among others.
16.3. We have heard the rival submissions. We find that this issue is already
settled in favour of the assessee in its own case by the order of this
tribunal for Asst Years 2007- 08 and 2008-09 in ITA No. 37 & 1623/Kol/2012
dated 3.8.2016 wherein it was held as under:-
> 3.3. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available
> on record including the paper book filed by the assessee comprising of
> relevant extracts of Central Electricity Authority (Installation and
> operation of meters) Regulations, 2006 (pages 47 to 66 of paper book) with
> regard to this issue. We find that the assessee had capitalized the
> following assets under intellectual properties :-
> a. Low cost single phase static meter IP for domestic segment. b. Low cost
> single phase static meter IP for South Asian market like Vietnam, etc c. RF
> AMR Radio frequency accelerated meter reading IP d. Salem 3T Metering Module
> IP e. Salem 1G HVDS IP f. PL Comm Evaluation Modem IP  34 35 ITA Nos.584 &
> 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 3.3.1. It was argued that the intellectual property
> rights acquired by the assessee consisted of designs, software, data base,
> research and development material and facility , technical know how, process
> know how , confidential information, basic and detailed drawings, operation
> and maintenance manuals relating to the business carried out by TECRES. The
> valuation of the same was carried out by an independent expert and valuation
> report is enclosed in pages 25 to 82 of paper book. We find that the OECD
> Tranfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax
> Administrations issued in July 2010 (enclosed in pages 67 to 73 of Part A of
> Paper Book) provides that the term 'intangible property' includes rights to
> use industrial assets such as patents, trademark, trade names, designs or
> models. It also includes literary and artistic property rights and
> intellectual property such as knowhow and trade secrets. These intangibles
> are assets that may have considerable value eventhough they may have no book
> value in the company's balance sheet. We find in Para 1.155 of the OECD /
> G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Report on Actions 8-
10 (2015) - Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation, issued in
the year 2015, 'that in some situations, the transfer or secondment of one or
more employees may, depending on the facts and circumstances, result in the
transfer of valuable knowhow or other intangibles from one associated
enterprise to another'. Even though in the instant case, the transaction is
between two unrelated enterprises, the principles enunciated therein would
squarely apply. Further para 6.20 of the said action plan, provide that
'knowhow and trade secrets are proprietory information or knowledge that
assists or improve a commercial activity, but that are not registered for
protection in the manner of patent or trademark. Knowhow and trade secrets
generally consist of undisclosed information of an industrial , commercial or
scientific nature arising from previous experience, which has practical
application in the operation of an enterprise. Knowhow and trade secrets may
relate to manufacturing , marketing, research and development, or any other
commercial activity. The value of know how and trade secrets is often
dependent on the ability of the enteprise to preserve the confidentiality of
the know how or trade secret. In certain industries the disclosure of
information necessary to obtain patent protection could assist competitors in
developing alternative solutions. Accordingly, an enterprise may, for sound
business reasons, choose not to register patentable knowhow, which may
nonetheless contribute substantially to the success of the enterprise. The
confidential nature of knowhow and trade secrets may be protected to some
degree by (i) unfair competition or similar laws , (ii) employment contracts,
and (iii) economic and technological barriers to competition. Knowhow and
trade secrets are intangibles.' .

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Hence it could be safely concluded that even OECD has
laid down the principle that intellectual property in the form of knowhow is
not required to be registered.
3.3.2. We find that the assessee had filed a copy of the Business Transfer
Agreement (BTA) entered into with Mr Gandhi as an additional evidence. It was
submitted by the ld AR that the said agreement was never called for by the
lower authorities and hence there was no occasion for the assessee to file the
same and it was also submitted that the acquisition of business from Mr Gandhi
by the assessee was never a subject matter of debate. In these circumstances,
we deem it fit and appropriate to admit the said additional evidence for
better appreciation of the facts to resolve the issue under dispute before us.
3.3.3. We find force in the argument advanced by the ld AR that the transfer
of employees would also result in transfer of knowhow also. We find that the
Explanation 4 to section 32(1) of the Act defines 'knowhow' as any industrial
information or technique likely to assist in the manufacture or processing of
goods or in the working of a mine, oil-well or other sources of mineral
deposits (including searching for discovery or testing of deposits for the
winning of access thereto). Section 32(1)(ii) of the act provides for
depreciation on intangible assets including knowhow, patents, copyrights,
trade marks, licences, franchises, or any other business or commercial rights
of similar nature, being intangible assets acquired on or after 1st day of
April 1998. Hence from the combined reading of OECD, definition of knowhow and
provisions of section 32 of the Act in respect of intangible assets, it could
be safely concluded that depreciation is allowed on intellectual property
being knowhow and such intellectual property is not required to be registered
with any government authority . Know how is an intangible property, rights in
respect of which can be bought and sold. As per the Law Lexicon dictionary,
'knowhow' indicates something essentially different from secret and
confidential information. It indicates the way in which a skilled man does his
job with his skill and experience. It was also stated that knowhow is a
closely held unpatented inventions, formulae, design, drawings, procedures and
methods together with accumulated skills and experience in the hands of a
licensor firm's professional personnel.
3.3.4. It is not in dispute that assessee had acquired from TECRES six
different IPs which were independently valued by the independent expert before
the company was taken over by the assessee company. Admittedly TECRES was
engaged in the research and development of metering related to software and
communication technology which is useable in measurement of electrical and
management of energy. It is not in dispute that the said company had been
delivering service in the field of metering software development of static
meters for major Indian manufacturers in the metering industry namely L & T ,
Genus,  36 37 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis
+ Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 HPL Socomec etc apart from doing work for other overseas
clients. We find that the assessee in order to migrate into the new lucrative
business of manufacturing static meters was looking for partner which could
help it out in its new venture. Therefore, after a detailed study and informed
business decision , the assessee decided to buy out the entire unit of TECRES
along with its specialized research engineers who had enormous experience and
domain knowledge in respect of static meters which the assessee could leverage
in developing new marketable products. Therefore, in essence what the assessee
has acquired is knowhow in developing new type of meters which were digital
meters with anti-tampering and other communication facilities. We find that
the reliance placed by the ld AR on the Co-ordinate bench decision of Pune
Tribunal in the case of Modular Infotech P Ltd vs DCIT reported in 131 TTJ 243
(Pune) is well founded. In the said case, the assessee company was engaged in
the business of software development and also licensing of software. It had
taken over the business of a firm namely M/s Modular Systems and claimed
depreciation @ 25% on an amount of Rs. 4,27,00,000/- pertaining to the value
of IPR paid to the firm. The AO disallowed the claim of depreciation on IPR
against which assessee filed appeal before the ld CITA. During the appellate
proceedings with the CITA, the appellant pointed out that the amount of Rs.
4.27 crores included composite consideration in respect of all the intangible
assets of the firm namely IPRs and the goodwill and submitted a fresh
valuation of the assets including that of the goodwill at Rs. 79,50,000/-. The
CITA disallowed depreciation on goodwill of Rs. 79,50,000/- and allowed
assessee's claim of depreciation in respect of balance IPR payment. On appeal
filed before the Tribunal, it was held that where assessee company took over
business of a firm at value assessed by professionals and value so determined
was made part of agreement, it was wrong to presume that there was a notional
amount which was transacted between parties, hence disallowance of
depreciation on intellectual property rights on ground that value was assigned
to an asset which was non- existent was not justified. We find that the facts
of the assessee's case are also similar to the facts before the Pune Tribunal
supra. It is not in dispute that the turnover of the assessee had
substantially increased from the year under appeal on account of activities of
the R&D Centre which the assessee had acquired from Mr Gandhi. The element of
know how is inherent in the static meters manufactured by the assessee
pursuant to acquisition of TECRES. It is not in dispute that the entire
Research & Development team of TECRES along with their developed codes and
domain depository have joined the assessee. Hence it cannot be said that the
assessee had not acquired any intellectual properties from Mr Gandhi. The
total consideration paid by the assessee in the sum of Rs. 6,07,89,093/- to
Mr. Gandhi has not been disputed. Out of this total consideration, the
assessee had bifurcated the value towards IP rights to the tune of Rs. 4.92
crores based on an independent valuation from an expert. The main  37 38 ITA
Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 emphasis for disallowance is only on the point that the
intellectual properties is not approved by any government or any competent
authority. Nowhere the income tax act mandates the registration of the
intellectual properties for the purpose of granting depreciation u/s 32 of the
Act. Getting the intellectual properties registered is within the domain of
the assessee and it only offers protection to the assessee from preventing
other parties to use the same. The revenue cannot thrust the mandate of
registration of the same and mere non- registration of the same does not make
the transaction ingenuine or sham. Hence the version of the revenue that IP
should be certified by the government authority and it does not fall within
the assets specified in IT Rules is without any basis and not tenable.
3.3.5. In view of the aforesaid findings and respectfully following the
judicial precedent relied upon hereinabove, we allow the grounds 2(a) to 2(d)
raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2007-08 and grounds 12(1) to 12(c )
raised for the Asst Year 2008-09. The ld AO is also directed to rework the
opening WDV of this asset in the subsequent year and rework the allowability
of depreciation on the same pursuant to this order. In view of this decision,
we are not inclined to entertain the alternative claim of the assessee vide
ground no. 1(a) that the consideration so paid in the sum of Rs. 4,92,00,000/-
has to be construed as Goodwill and depreciation has to be granted
accordingly.
Respectfully following the said decision of this tribunal for the earlier
years, we allow the Grounds 8(a) to 8(c ) raised by the assessee for the Asst
Year 2010-11.
17\. Disallowance of Depreciation on Goodwill The assessee recorded an amount
of Rs 93,41,680/- as Goodwill arising as a result of acquisition of business
from Mr Guljeet Singh Gandhi during Asst Year 2007-08. No depreciation on such
goodwill was claimed in the return of income by the assessee. The assessee
filed additional grounds of appeal before this tribunal for the Asst Years
2007-08 and 2008-09 claiming depreciation on goodwill in the light of the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs Smifs Securities
ltd reported in 348 ITR 302 (SC) and the same was granted to the assessee. The
assessee similarly filed additional ground of objection before ht eld DRP for
the Asst Year 2010-11 claiming depreciation amounting to Rs 11,49,465/- on
written down value of goodwill. The ld  38 39 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 DRP did not allow the same as at that point of time, the
appeal was pending before this tribunal for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09
and pending finality of the same, it felt that no decision would be warranted.
It is not in dispute that the assesee had paid consideration towards
acquisition of Goodwill. We find that since this issue is now settled in
favour of the assessee by the order of this tribunal for the Asst Years
2007-08 and 2008-09, we hold that assessee should be allowed depreciation on
goodwill amounting to Rs 11,49,465/- on the written down value of goodwill.
Accordingly the Ground No. 9 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11
is allowed.
18\. The Ground No. 10 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 is
with regard to short credit of TDS to the tune of Rs 11,12,472/-. The assessee
claimed credit of TDS amounting to Rs 11,58,178/- in the return of income and
additional credit of TDS of Rs 3,10,550/- vide letter dated 7.3.2014 during
the course of assessment proceedings. The assessee filed all the TDS
certificates to the ld AO . Credit for TDS of Rs 3,10,550/- was not taken in
the return of income as the assessee was not in possession of the TDS
certificates at that point of time and had received the same subsequent to the
date of filing the return. In the draft assessment order, the ld AO gave
credit for TDS of Rs 11,58,178/- as claimed in the return of income and denied
the additional claim of credit of TDS of Rs 3,10,550/- without providing any
specific reason. The assessee filed an objection before the ld DRP. The ld DRP
vide its direction dated 29.12.2014 directed the ld AO to verify the TDS
certificates and allow due credit to the assessee. In case of any short
allowance, the ld AO was directed to pass a speaking order. The ld AO in the
final assessment order dated 27.2.2015 , granted credit for TDS to the tune of
Rs 3,56,256/- only out of Rs 14,68,728/- ( 11,58,178 +3,10,550) without
providing any reason. Hence the assessee is in appeal before us seeking to
give direction to grant credit of TDS for the remaining amount to the tune of
Rs 11,12,472/-.

ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 18.1. We find that the ld AO while framing the final
assessment order had not carried out the directions of the ld DRP. Once the
assessee produces the TDS certificates before the ld AO in support of its
claim for credit of TDS, the duty of the ld AO is to grant the same on getting
satisfied whether the relatable income thereon has been duly offered to tax by
the assessee in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Hence we direct the
ld AO to grant the credit of TDS after verification of the fact whether the
relatable income thereon is offered to tax. Accordingly the Ground No. 10
raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 is allowed for statistical
purposes.
19\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 687/Kol/2015 is
partly allowed for statistical purposes.
Revenue Appeal - Asst Year 2010-11 - ITA No. 584/Kol/2015
20\. The Ground No.1 raised by the revenue for the Asst Year 2010-11 is
objecting to the directions of the ld DRP to remove certain comparable
companies. The adjudication of this ground becomes academic as ultimately the
ld AR had proved that the international transactions had been carried out at
arm's length by benchmarking its transactions with the comparables chosen by
the ld TPO only. Hence the adjudication of this ground becomes academic in
nature in view of our decision rendered in assessee appeal for the Asst Year
2010-11 with regard to TP issues. Accordingly, the Ground No. 1 raised by the
revenue is dismissed.
21\. The next ground to be decided in the appeal of the revenue is as to
whether the ld DRP was justified in concluding that the services provided by
the AE under the head of management services are not in the nature of
stewardship activities, in the facts and circumstances of the case.
40 41
ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 21.1. The brief facts of this issue is that the during
the year, the assessee received varied intra group services from its AE,
Landis + Gyr AG, Switzerland for which a payment of Rs 7.23 crores was made by
the assessee to its AE. With respect to the said transaction, the assessee
submitted that it had received varied nature of management services under a
Service Agreement entered into with its AE. For the purpose of compliance with
the transfer pricing documentation requirements, the assessee documented in
its transfer pricing study report and submitted in the course of assessment,
the management services framework wherein the description of services
received, payment terms, details of cost allocation mechanism, evidences of
benefits received from such services etc were explained. These are enclosed in
Pages 199-208 read with pages 282 to 1068 of the Paper Book. With respect to
economic analysis, the assessee considered, payment of management service fee
to be a different class of transaction, distinct from other international
transactions. Accordingly, based on functional analysis, AE was determined as
the least complex party and accordingly determined to be the tested party for
the purpose of analysis. Further, TNMM was determined to be the most
appropriate method of the methods prescribed. A search process was also
undertaken to identify comparable companies rendering similar services and the
international transaction was determined to at arm's length. Summary of
benchmarking study has been provided herein below:
Pricing methodology followed by AE while Arm's length Price of the comparable
rendering services to assessee companies in AE region rendering similar
services Cost Plus 5% Cost plus 6.98% As the margin retained by AE of the
appellant was less than the margin earned by comparable companies in its
region, the transaction price was determined to have been undertaken at arm's
length.

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 21.2. The ld TPO however, disregarded the aforesaid
information along with benchmarking analysis submitted by the assessee and
treated the ALP of the transaction as NIL stating that the services rendered
pertain to stewardship services. The Ld. TPO stated that the services rendered
by the AE of the assessee were mostly in the nature of exercising overall
control and supervision over the assessee company and hence these were in the
nature of stewardship services thereby not meriting any charge.
21.3. The ld DRP deleted the adjustment made by the TPO stating that "From the
nature of services described by the assessee, it can be seen that they were
mainly for purpose of assessee's own business. While the group as a whole,
might also have been benefitted from the services, such benefit to the parent
company was incidental. The primary beneficiary of the services was the
assessee itself." "Therefore, the services rendered by the AE cannot be
considered in the nature of stewardship/shareholder activity." "It has been
informed by the assessee that the payment for the services has been made on
the cost allocated to it."
21.4. The revenue had filed an appeal against the aforesaid action of ld DRP
stating that the ld DRP had erred in concluding that the services provided by
the AE are not in the nature of stewardship activities.
21.5. The ld DR submitted that this issue may be remanded to the file of the
ld TPO for determination of ALP of the payment of management fees in the light
of various documentary evidences furnished by the assessee for the benefits
derived by the assessee out of payment of management service fees for the
intra group services received from its AE. In response to this, the ld AR
stated that it had duly furnished sample set of 94 emails, correspondences
etc, demonstrating the services received by the assessee from AE along with
the copy of emails, correspondences etc . He stated that the assessee had
tried to capture to the extent possible the benefits received from  42 43 ITA
Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 the said category of services in the form of emails,
communications, reports etc and the illustration of benefits received from
various categories of services as mentioned in the cost allocation sheet was
duly submitted before the ld TPO and ld DRP. In fact the ld DRP had called for
a remand report from the ld TPO in this regard for determination of ALP based
on the documents available on record. The ld TPO did not give any adverse
finding about this issue in the remand report and merely stated that these
were in the nature of shareholder services. Hence the ld DRP had analysed the
entire services in great detail along with the benefits accruing from the
services to the assessee as could be seen in Pages 25 to 30 of ld DRP order.
The ld DRP on perusing and analyzing the same information / documents,
concluded that the assessee had duly received services which had benefited the
assessee in its business operations. Accordingly it concluded that the
services were in the nature for which any third party would be willing ot pay
and hence not in the nature of stewardship services. The ld DRP also
appreciated the fact that it would be impractical for assessee to keep
documentary evidences for each of the services received by it as the services
are received in the form of directions, recommendations through emails, calls,
reports etc. However, for the purpose of demonstration and explanation before
the ld TPO / ld DRP, the assessee had enclosed a sample set of 94 voluminous
documents evidencing the regular flow of valuable commercial services under
the agreement with the ld TPO. He stated that the ld TPO was offered
opportunity to examine all these documents twice i.e. one at the time of
original TP hearing and another during remand proceedings. But the ld TPO
chose to ignore the said documents without assigning any reasons. Hence the ld
DRP had no other option but to examine those documents and concluded that the
assessee had indeed received lot of commercial benefits pursuant to payment of
management service charges to its AE as could be evident from the various set
of emails, correspondences, filed on record. Hence he argued that there is no
need to remand the issue to the file of the ld TPO in this regard. The ld AR
also placed reliance on the following decisions  43 44 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 in support of his contentions that payment of management
service charges for intra group services are not in the nature of stewardship
activities :-
a) Co-ordinate bench decision of Delhi Tribunal in the case of AWB India (P)
Ltd vs Addl CIT reported in TS-67-ITAT-2013(DEL)-TP
b) Decision of Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of CIT vs Max
India Limited reported in TS-9480HC-2016(P&H).
c) Decision of Co-ordinate Bench of this Tribunal in the case of Almatis
Alumina Pvt Ltd in ITA No. 283/Kol/2016 and CO 23/Kol/2016.
21.6. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available
on record including the paper books of the assessee filed in this regard. We
find that the assessee had indeed furnished sample set of 94 emails,
correspondences etc before the ld TPO which were summarily ignored by him
while passing the order u/s 92CA(3) of the Act. The ld TPO held that the
payment for intra group services are in the nature of stewardship activities
and were paid only for the control and supervision over the assessee and
accordingly determined the ALP of the said transaction at Rs Nil. During the
proceedings before the ld DRP, the remand report was duly called for from the
ld TPO, who did not comment anything adverse on the various set of documents
and evidences for receipt of commercial benefits by the assessee from its AE
pursuant to payment of management service charges for rendering intra group
services. We find that the ld DRP had duly examined the various set of
documents placed on record and had concluded that the assessee had indeed
derived commercial benefits out of rendering of intra group services by the AE
and the payment made thereon are in the nature which any third party would be
willing to pay and held that they are not in the nature of stewardship
services. We have gone through those papers placed in the paper book before us
(pages 1354 to 1359 of Paper Book) and we hold that the said services enable
the assessee to meet the challenges of the business environment on an on-going
44 45 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr
Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 basis and the same are rendered continuously and the
assessee had been actually benefited out of those services. In any case, we
hold that the ld TPO cannot determine the value of management services to be
Rs Nil without applying any transfer pricing methods.
21.6.1. We find that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs
Cushman and Wakefield (India) (P) Ltd reported in (2014) 367 ITR 730 (Del) is
applicable to the facts of the instant case, wherein it was held that :-
> "35. The Transfer Pricing Officer's report is, subsequent to the Finance
> Act, 2007, binding on the Assessing Officer. Thus, it becomes all the more
> important to clarify the extent of the Transfer Pricing Officer's authority
> in this case, which is to determining the arm's length price for
> international transactions referred to him or her by the Assessing Officer,
> rather than determining whether [such services exist or benefits have
> accrued. That exercise of factual verification is retained by the Assessing
> Officer under Section 37 in this case.] Indeed, this is not to say that the
> Transfer Pricing Officer cannot after a consideration of the facts state
> that the arm's length price is 'nil' given that an independent entity in a
> comparable transaction would not pay any amount. However, this is different
> from the Transfer Pricing Officer stating that the assessee did not benefit
> from these services, which amounts to disallowing expenditure. That decision
> is outside the authority of the Transfer Pricing Officer. ...... .......
> .... .
36\. In this case, the issue is whether an independent entity would have paid
for such services. Importantly, in reaching this conclusion, neither the
Revenue, nor this Court, must question the commercial wisdom of the assessee,
or replace its own assessment of the commercial viability of the transaction.
The services rendered by CWS and CWHK in this case concern liaising and client
interaction with IBM on behalf of the assessee-activities for which, according
to the assessee's claim-interaction with IBM's regional offices in Singapore
and the United States was necessary. These services cannot as the Income-tax
Appellate Tribunal correctly surmised be duplicated in India insofar as they
require interaction abroad. Whether it is commercially prudent or not to
employ outsiders to conduct this activity is a matter that lies within the
assessee's exclusive domain, and cannot be second- guessed by the Revenue."
[brackets provided by us] 21.6.2. We also find that the co-ordinate bench
decision of this tribunal in the case of DCIT vs Bata India Ltd reported in
(2016) 69 taxmann.com 120 (Kolkata Trib) dated 6.4.2016 had considered the
decisions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs EKL Appliances Ltd
(2012) 345 ITR 241 (Del) ; CIT vs Cushman & Wakefield  45 46 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 (India) (P) Ltd (2014) 367 ITR 730 (Del) and co-ordinate
bench of Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Dresser Rand India (P) Ltd vs Addl CIT
(2011) 47 SOT 423 (Mum) and applied the principles emanating out of those
judgments and applied the same to the facts of the case in Bata India Ltd. In
the said case (i.e Bata India Ltd supra) it was observed as under:-
> 27\. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case of CIT v. EKL Appliances
> Ltd.[2012] 345 ITR 241/24 taxmann.com 199/209 Taxman 200 as well as CIT v.

> (Delhi), rendered similar ruling as was rendered in the case of Dresser-Rand
> India (P.) Ltd. (supra). In the case of Cushman & Wakefield India (P.) Ltd.
> (supra), the Hon'ble Delhi High Court observed that whether a third party -
> in an uncontrolled transaction with the Taxpayer would have charged amounts
> lower, equal to or greater than the amounts claimed by the AEs, has to
> perforce be tested under the various methods prescribed under the Indian TP
> provisions. In the context of cost sharing arrangement, the Hon'ble High
> Court opined that concept of base erosion is not a logical inference from
> the fact that the AEs have only asked for reimbursement of cost. This being
> a transaction between related parties, whether that cost itself is inflated
> or not only is a matter to be tested under a comprehensive transfer pricing
> analysis. The basis for the costs incurred, the activities for which they
> were incurred, and the benefit accruing to the Taxpayer from those

> secondly, whether that amount meets ALP criterion. In the present case
> however, the arrangement between the AE and the Assessee is not a cost

> to the present case.
> 28\. The following aspects would require consideration in order to identify

> \- Whether services were received from related party.
> \- Nature of services including quantum of services received by the related
> party.
> \- Services were provided in order to meet specific need of recipient of the

> \- The economic and commercial benefits derived by the recipient of

21.6.3. We also find that in the recent decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in the case of Knorr-Bremse India (P) Ltd vs ACIT reported in (2016) 380
ITR 307 (Del) wherein it was held as under:-
> 29\. We hasten to add that in the case before us the assessee has, in fact,
> contended that it has benefited from the international transactions entered
> into by it with its AEs. However, even assuming that this has not been
> established, it would make no difference.
> 31\. The TPO, in the case before us, had observed as under:--
> "The OECD guidelines lay down the principle that the basis of indirect
> charge will have to answer the benefit test. Para 7.24 of the OECD
> guidelines further states, "To satisfy the arm's length principle, the
> allocation method chosen must lead to a result that is consistent with what
> comparable independent enterprises would have been prepared to accept."
> Therefore, the assessee cannot escape its responsibilities of having to show
> the actual benefit it has received. The assessee will also have to
> demonstrate that independent parties would be inclined to make such a
> payment in similar circumstances."
> The TPO's conclusion in the last but one sentence does not follow from the
> OECD Guidelines quoted by him. The OECD Guidelines merely state that the
> result must be consistent with what comparable independent enterprises would
> have been prepared to accept. We do not see how from this observation it
> follows that the assessee cannot escape its responsibility of having to show
> the actual benefits it had received.
> 46\. There is yet another issue of law which, in our view, is important and
> requires consideration. The TPO referred to the management support services.
> The same fell within four categories, namely, business development, human
> resource services, accounting, financial support and controlling services
> and IT services. With regard to the same, the TPO held that the assessee had
> sufficient local help to allow it to overcome the legal challenges at the
> local level. The TPO held that there was no reason to believe that the AEs
> provided assistance that the assessee could not obtain at the local level in
> India. Mr. Joshi, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  47 48 ITA
> Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 respondent, submitted that for these and other

We find that this judgement had approved the earlier decision of Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of Cushman and Wakefield (India) (P) Ltd supra and also
the decision of EKL Appliances supra.
21.6.4. We find that the ld TPO had rejected the benchmarking analysis adopted
by the assessee. However, it failed to provide its own benchmarking analysis
to determine the transaction price to be Rs Nil. Moreover, when ld DRP
remanded back the case to the file of the ld TPO for analysis of the
benchmarking analysis and providing ground wise observations for arguments
raised by the assessee before the ld DRP, the ld TPO did not provide any
comments with respect to economic analysis carried out by the assessee and the
documents submitted by the assessee for transaction pertaining to payment of
management service fees. Hence in these circumstances , there is no harm in
accepting the assessee's method of benchmarking and the payment of management
service charges for the intra group services received from its AE. There is no
dispute that the assessee had indeed received services from its AE. There is
no dispute that the assessee had indeed received commercial benefits out of
services rendered by the AE. The findings given by the ld DRP in this regard
are not controverted by the ld DR before us.

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 21.6.5. We find that the ld AR also stated that the
allocation keys used to share the burden of the cost are also sound and can be
taken to be as the arm's length contribution to the costs. For the same, the
assessee has shared the cost allocation stateemtns wherein appropriate cost
allocation drivers have been used which have been agreed between the parties
beforehand. Along with an appropriate benchmarking analysis and evidence of
receipt of services with consequent benefits, viewed from whichever way, the
payment for management support services fulfil the arm's length test.
21.6.6. In view of the aforesaid findings and respectfully following the
judicial precedents relied upon hereinabove, we hold that the determination of
ALP for Management Support Services at Rs NIL is unwarranted and accordingly
reject the adjustment made to the income of the assessee by the ld TPO and
hence addition made in the sum of Rs. 7,22,96,951/- is deleted. Accordingly,
the Ground Nos 2 raised by the revenue is dismissed.
22\. Payment of Royalty - Rs 2,39,63,552/-
The assessee received technology and technical assistance for manufacture of
electric and static meters under a Technology License Agreement entered into
with the AEs for which a payment of Rs 2,39,63,552/- ( Rs 2.40 crores) was
made by the assessee. The assessee had duly documented the terms of such
agreement, description of technology, technical assistance etc in the transfer
pricing study report prepared and submitted for the perusal of the ld TPO vide
page 209 to 215 of part I of the Paper Book. With regard to economic analysis,
the assessee considered such transaction to be of different class and distinct
from other transactions. Accordingly, the assessee evaluated the methods
prescribed under the Indian TP regulations and determined CUP to be the MAM.
For the purpose of application of CUP, the assessee identified certain
agreements, following a detailed search process, which could be considered

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 transaction. Accordingly the said transaction was
determined to be at arm's length. The summary of benchmarking study has been
provided herein below:-
    Rate of Royalty paid by the assessee to its AE           -      1.21%
    Arm's length rate of royalty as determined from
    Benchmarking study                                       -      4.34%
Thus it was pleaded that the royalty rate charged by the AE was lower than the
royalty rate as per the comparable agreements, the transaction was determined
to have been undertaken at arm's length price.
22.1. The ld TPO without purusing the necessary information submitted on
records, held that the value of such technology should be Rs Nil. The ld TPO
stated that the technology provided by the AE was not unique in nature and
that the assessee was not bale to show that it derived any substantial benefit
from the technology received from the AE and accordingly imputed an upward
adjustment of Rs 2,39,63,552/- for the same.
22.2. The ld DRP deleted the adjustment made by the ld TPO by stating as
under:-
> 3.5.2. Since it had been claimed that the assessee had filed all the details
> called for before the TPO, vide its submission dated 27/1/2014, which had
> not been taken into account by the TPO, comments of the TPO were called for
> by the Panel vide letter dated 10/12/2014. The comments of the TPO have been

> assessee has provided comparable royalty transaction using foreign data base
> and comes up with royalty of comparables at 4.33%. The TPO has objected to
> the choice of database of US company used by the assessee and has stated
> that the royalty paid by assessee in case of Baddi-Static meter unit at 5%
> was higher than the benchmark computed by assessee. The assessee has given

22.3. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available
on record. We find that the information / documents evidencing receipt of
technology / technical assistance and benchmarking analysis determining the
ALP of the same has been duly submitted both before the ld TPO and ld DRP. The
ld TPO without perusing and analyzing the said information concluded that the
technology received by the assessee was not unique and has no avenue for
future development. We find however, the ld DRP on perusing and analyzing the
same information / documents, concluded that the technology / technical
assistance so received was unique in nature and amount of royalty paid was
reasonably justified as well. The finding given by the ld DRP on the receipt
of technology / technical assistance by the assessee was not controverted by
the revenue before us. It was also stated that the apprehensions raised by the
ld TPO were duly replied by the assessee before him vide reply to show cause
notice and the same were completely ignored by the ld TPO while passing the
order. The ld AR on the apprehensions raised by the ld TPO stated as under:-
APPREHENSION 1 - Technology furnished by the AE was not unique in nature and
has no avenue for the assessee to participate any future development  51 52
ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 With regard to the above, the assessee submitted that the
intangible is complete technology including design, bom, testing process etc
for making a mechanical meter compliant with Swiss quality and standards.
Further, the intangible property shall also include the following:
\- Drawings and parts list of the complete products and various CKD products
\- Work instructions for the manufacture, assembly and calibration of the
meters
\- Information on quantity and quality of materials to be used and parts to be
purchased
\- Information on necessary tooling activity required for manufacturing of
meter
\- Operational manuals The assessee submitted that the unique property is the
design of the meter that is being manufactured. Further, the Swiss technology
was used to design a meter specifically for Indian market customizing the same
as per the Central Electricity Authority of India. From perusal of the annual
report of the assessee, it could be seen that there are no R&D expenses in the
books of the assessee. This implies that the assessee is not engaged in R&D
activities with respect to manufacturing and sale of meters in India. The
assessee is made avaialbel with ready and tested technology to manufacture the
meter. It stated that without the aid of the said technology, the assessee
would not have been able to do its manufacturing business. Further, the
technology received from the AE, allowed the assessee to introduce for the
first time high quality, tamper-resistant electric meters having longer life
than its competitor products. Further, continuous improvement, upgradations
etc. takes place in the technology of meter manufacturing to meet the
expectations of the customer and to stand out as a unique product in the
market. Further, Indian electricity market is infected with tampering of meter
which obstructs measuring of accurate consumption of energy. The most famous
tampers are known as '35kv' and 'Jammer' , wherein the capability of measuring
energy is affected significantly. Futher, new method sof meter tampering are
invented in India. The assessee is expected from its customers and
stakeholders to manufacture and deliver  52 53 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 tamper-resistant meters. The assessee is dependant on R&D
team of its AE for developing specific technology to deal with tampering of
meters in India.
APPREHENSION 2 - Assessee failed to provide justification regarding
reasonableness of the amount of royalty paid to AE The assessee submitted that
the royalty is being paid by the assessee only with respect to value additions
being made by the assessee from its own manufacturing process undertaken with
aid of technology and technical assistance received from the AE. To establish
the same, the assessee had submitted the methodology applied in determining
the value of sales on which royalty is paid by the assessee to its AE. The
same are enclosed in page 159 of Part I of the Paper Book. The assessee pays
royalty on value of meters manufactured less the bought out components used in
the meters. Therefore, it confirms that royalty is not paid by the assessee on
the bought out components. As already submitted, the assessee is paying
royalty not on the gross sales but only on the value addition made, which
effectively works out to only 1.21% of total sales as compared to arm's length
rate of royalty as determined from benchmarking study at 4.34%.
22.3.1. We find that the ld TPO while passing the order u/s 92CA(3) of the
Act, ignored the CUP analysis undertaken by the assessee for justifying the
arm's length nature of the international transaction and instead went ahead
and determined the arm's length price of the transaction at Rs Nil stating
that the assessee was not able to justify the reasonableness of the amount of
royalty. We find that in the following decisions, it has been held that CUP
method is the MAM to determine the arm's length nature of international
transaction of payment of royalty:-
a) Castrol India Limited vs DCIT reported in (2014) 40 CCH 764 (Mumbai Trib.)
b) Reebok India Co. reported in TS-160-ITAT-2013(DEL)
c) Benetton India P Ltd vs ITO reported in (2012) 134 ITD 229 (Delhi Trib.)
d) Ciba India Limited reported in TS-242-ITAT-2013(MUM)-TP  53 54 ITA Nos.584
& 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 We find that the ld TPO erred in not communicating the
relevant clause of section 92C(3) of the Act under which the CUP analysis
undertaken by the assessee was found to be defective leading him to reject the
analysis and adopt TNMM as the MAM.
22.3.2. We find that as per the provisions of section 92C(3) of the Act read
with section 92CA(3) of the Act, the ld TPO may proceed to determine the ALP
if he is of the opinion that conditions as provided in section 92C(3) of the
Act have been satisfied. In this regard, CBDT had issued a Circular No.
12/2001 dated 23.8.2001 which would be relevant in this regard:-
> CLARIFICATION ON PROVISIONS GOVERNING TRANSFER PRICE IN AN INTERNATIONAL
> TRANSACTION CIRCULAR : NO. 12/2001, DATED 23-8-2001
> ................................................ In this background the
> Board have decided the following :
        (i)     ..........................
       (ii)     ..........................
      (iii)     It should be made clear to the concerned Assessing Officer that where an
> international transaction has been put to a scrutiny, the Assessing Officer
> can have recourse to sub-section (3) of section 92C only under the
> circumstances enumerated in clauses (a) to (d) of that sub-section and in
> the event of material information or documents in his possession on the
> basis of which an opinion can be formed that any such circumstances exists.
> In all other cases, the value of the international transaction should be
> accepted without further scrutiny.
From the reading of the aforesaid circular, it is clear that the intention of
the section 92C(3) of the Act has always been that scrutiny of international
transactions of an assessee can only be done if the ld TPO can prove that
atleast any one of the four conditions laid down in section 92C(3) of the Act
has been satisfied. This view has been ratified by the co-ordinate bench of
Bangalore Tribunal in the case of Philips  54 55 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015
ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Software Centre Private Limited vs ACIT in ITA No. 218
(Bng)/2008 wherein it was held that :-
> "The TPO or the AO needs to satisfy and communicate to the taxpayer the
> relevant clause under section 92C(3) which has been triggered by the
> assessee, which has necessitated the application of provisions of the
> transfer pricing provisions. In the instant case, since this was not
> demonstrated to the assessee, the transfer pricing order is void."
We find from the order of the ld TPO that he has nowhere suggested that any of
the clauses of section 92C(3) of the Act are satisfied.
22.3.3. We also find that considering CUP as the MAM for benchmarking the
transaction of payment of royalty has been upheld by this tribunal in
assessee's own case for the Asst Years 2007-08 and 2008-09 vide order dated
3.8.2016 wherein it was held that :-
> 5.2.15. .........................
> We hold that the study made by the assessee with regard to payment of
> royalty using CUP method as the MAM and using specific database
> 'RoyaltyStat' for benchmarking royalty transactions which has been accepted
> by the revenue in the subsequent years, should be applied for the years
> under appeal also to put an end to this controversy. Hence in order to meet
> the ends of justice, we direct the ld TPO/ ld AO accordingly.
22.3.4. We also find that during the course of TP assessment for the Asst Year
2011-12, the said transaction of payment of royalty has been considered to be
at arm's length by the ld TPO wherein same economic analysis has been adopted
by the assessee to determine the ALP of the transaction.
22.3.5. In view of the aforesaid findings and respectfully following the
judicial precedents relied upon hereinabove, we hold that the determination of
ALP for payment of royalty at Rs NIL is unwarranted and accordingly reject the
adjustment made to the  55 56 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 income of the assessee by the ld TPO and hence addition
made in the sum of Rs. 2,39,63,552/- is deleted. Accordingly, the Ground Nos 3
raised by the revenue is dismissed.
23\. In the result, the appeal of the revenue in ITA No. 584/Kol/2015 for Asst
Year 2010-11 is dismissed.
Asst Year 2011-12 - ITA No. 619/Kol/2016 - Assessee Appeal
24\. The Ground No.1 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is
general in nature and does not require any specific adjudication. The Ground
No. 2 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2010-11 against the
confirmation of adjustment of Rs 96,43,641/- to the international transactions
of the assessee with its Associated Enterprises (AEs) is dealt with
independently in other grounds adjudicated hereinbelow. Hence this ground does
not require any specific adjudication.
25\. Adjustment to Arm's Length Price - ITA No. 619/Kol/2016 (Assessee Appeal)
- Asst Year 2011-12 The Ground Nos. 3 , 4(a), 4(b) & 5 raised by the assessee
are similar to that raised in Asst Year 2010-11 and the decisions rendered
thereon would apply with equal force for this Asst Year also, except with
variance in figures. For the sake of clarity, the relevant figures for Asst
Year 2011-12 are reproduced below:-

Total value of international transactions - Rs 11.32 crores working out to
5.87% (11.32 / 192.77 * 100) of the meter segment.
Third party business turnover - Rs 181.45 crores - representing 94.13%.
The facts of Asst Year 2011-12 with regard to international transactions
carried out by the assessee with its AE are identical with that of Asst Year
2010-11. Accordingly, the Grounds 3, 4(a) , 4(b) and 5 raised by the assessee
for the Asst Year 2011-12 are allowed.
26\. The Ground Nos. 6 & 7 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12
are with regard to erroneous computation of arithmetic mean margin of
comparable companies and rejecting certain comparables chosen by the assessee.
The adjudication of this ground becomes academic as ultimately the ld AR had
proved that the international transactions had been carried out at arm's
length by benchmarking its transactions with the comparables chosen by the ld
TPO only. Hence the adjudication of this ground becomes academic in nature in
view of our decision rendered in assessee appeal for the Asst Year 2010-11
with regard to TP issues. Accordingly, the Ground Nos . 6 & 7 raised by the
assessee are allowed.

27\. The Ground No. 8 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is
general in nature and does not require any specific adjudication.
28\. The Ground No. 13 raised by the assessee is stated to be not pressed by
the ld AR at the time of hearing as necessary relief had already been granted
by the ld DRP. Accordingly the Ground No. 13 raised by the assessee is
dismissed as not pressed.
29\. The Ground No. 9 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is with
regard to the claim of depreciation on intellectual properties. This issue has
been adjudicated at length for the Asst Year 2010-11 vide paras 16 to 16.3
above and the decision rendered thereon would apply with equal force for this
Asst Year also. Accordingly, the Ground No. 9 raised by the assessee for the
Asst Year 2011-12 is allowed.
30\. The Ground No. 12 raised by the assessee is with regard to the
allowability of employees' contribution to PF in the sum of Rs 75,580/- which
was deposited before the due date of filing the return of income u/s 139(1) of
the Act. The date of deposit of employees contribution to PF before the due
date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of the Act is not in dispute. This issue
is settled in favour of the assessee by the decision of the Hon'ble
Jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT vs Vijay Shree Ltd reported in 43
taxmann.com 396 (Cal HC). Respectfully following the same, the Ground No. 12
raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is allowed.
31\. The Ground No. 17 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is
with regard to short credit of TDS to the tune of Rs 2,22,966/-. The assessee
claimed credit of TDS amounting to Rs 4,63,731/- in the return of income and
additional credit of TDS of Rs 2,22,966/- vide letter dated 20.2.2015 during
the course of assessment proceedings based on physical TDS certificates
received and the said TDS being reflected in Form 26AS. The assessee filed all
the TDS certificates to the ld AO . Credit for TDS of Rs  58 59 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 2,22,966/- was not taken in the return of income as the
assessee was not in possession of the TDS certificates at that point of time
and had received the same subsequent to the date of filing the return. In the
draft assessment order, the ld AO did not give any credit for TDS of Rs
6,86,697/- ( 4,63,731 + 2,22,966) as claimed by the assessee wiithout
providing any specific reason. The assessee filed an objection before the ld
DRP. The ld DRP vide its direction dated 16.12.2015 directed the ld AO to
verify the TDS certificates and Form 26AS and allow due credit to the
assessee. The ld AO in the final assessment order dated 29.1.2016 , granted
credit for TDS to the tune of Rs 4,63,731/- only out of Rs 6,86,697/- without
providing any reason. Hence the assessee is in appeal before us seeking to
give direction to grant credit of TDS for the remaining amount to the tune of
Rs 2,22,966/-.
31.1. We find that the ld AO while framing the final assessment order had not
carried out the directions of the ld DRP. Once the assessee produces the TDS
certificates before the ld AO in support of its claim for credit of TDS, the
duty of the ld AO is to grant the same on getting satisfied whether the
relatable income thereon has been duly offered to tax by the assessee in
accordance with the provisions of the Act. Hence we direct the ld AO to grant
the credit of TDS after verification of the fact whether the relatable income
thereon is offered to tax. Accordingly the Ground No. 17 raised by the
assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is allowed for statistical purposes.
32\. The next issue to be decided in this appeal of the assessee is as to
whether the ld DRP was justified in upholding the disallowance made in the sum
of Rs 2,06,67,831/- on account of provision for warranty in the facts and
circumstances of the case. The interconnected ground is as to whether the same
would have to be added back while computing book profits u/s 115JB of the Act.

ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 32.1. The ld AO observed that the assessee claimed
deduction on account of provision for warranty of Rs 2,06,67,831/- in the
return of income. The assessee was asked to furnish the details and
explanation in respect of claim of warranty on provision basis. The assessee
produced / furnished details in respect of provision for warranty. The ld AO
observed that the Hon'ble Apex Court had clearly emphasized in the case of
Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd vs CIT reported in 314 ITR 62 (SC) that the
assessee is entitled to deduciton provided a scientific data is systematically
maintained on the basis of past events. In the instant case, the estimated
claims made by the assessee cannot be recognized as a systematic data based on
widely accepted scientific calculation supported by information of earlier
years. Accordingly, he disallowed the provision for warranty in the assessment
under normal provisions of the Act. The ld AO also added the same while
computing the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act treating the same as provision
made for unascertained liabilities. This action of the ld AO was upheld by the
ld DRP. Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us vide Grounds 11 & 16\.
32.2. We have heard the rival submissions. From the perusal of the materials
available on record, we find that the assessee had made certain supplies to
West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL in short) who
had raised certain issues against the quality of the material supplied by the
assessee. The issues against supplies being made within the warranty period
and hence the assessee decdied to provide for the warranty on the material
delivered which the assessee had to replace. The provision was made for Rs
1,85,85,000/- on this account. The ld AR stated that these were specific
bookings and did not require the assistance of a sound method backed by
historical trends to determine its ascertainability.
32.2.1. We find that the assessee had made general provisions to the tune of
Rs 12.79 lakhs towards warranty. Apart from this, we find that the assessee
had actually spent a sum of Rs 8.04 lakhs towards warranty during the year.
The assessee had made total  60 61 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &

32.2.2. We find from the various correspondences addressed by WESEDCL to the
assessee enclosed in pages 1381 to 1401 of Part 3 of Paper Book filed by the
assessee informing that abnormal behaviour was noticed in the meters supplied
by the assessee to them. The correspondences also prove that the
representative of the assessee had duly visited the spot and agreed to the
disturbance created by the meters supplied by the assessee to WBSEDCL. We find
that the compliant from the said party had been received on 14.9.2010
(enclosed in page 1381 of Part 3 of Paper Book) . The total purchase order is
for 814000 Nos. of meters valued at Rs 68.04 crores. Out of that deliveries
made upto the month of receipt of compliant i.e upto sept 2010 was 296000
meters totally sold to WBSEDCL in Bankura, Burdwan and Midnapore. Out of this
supply, 31500 units of meters have been identified to be defective pursuant to
the personal inspection of the assessee's representative and assessee made
provision for the same by taking the cost of production of 31500 meters and
arrived at the figure of Rs 1,85,85,000/-. The details of the same are
enclosed in page 1391 of Part 3 of Paper Book. We find that the assessee had
made a provision for warranty in this regard on  61 62 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 coming to know that it had to replace 31500 units of
meters to WBSEDCL and accordingly considered its cost of production of Rs 590
per meter and arrived at the figure of Rs 1,85,85,000/- , which liability is
certain.
32.2.3. We place reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Bharat
Earth Movers vs CIT reported in 245 ITR 428 (SC) and Rotork Controls India (P)
Ltd vs CIT reported in 314 ITR 62 (SC) to prove that the provision made for
warranty is clearly an ascertained liability. We find that the liability had
arisen in a year and once the same is done, it has to be allowed as a
deduction although the said liability had to be discharged at a later date.
The term 'provision' is explained as 'a liability which can be measured only
by using a substantial degree of estimation'. We find from the aforesaid
decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the provision in order to be recognized
needs to satisfy three following parameters:-
> a) an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event ;
> b) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
> the obligation; and
> c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If these conditions are not met, then no provision could be recognized. Once
these parameters are satisfied and the liability for which the provision is
created is certain to result in outflow of resources of the assessee
irrespective of the future conduct of the business, then the liability will be
allowed as a deduction. In the instant case, the assessee as afar as the sum
of Rs 1,85,85,000/- , it satisfies all the criteria laid down i.e it is a
definitive sum and is extremely certain to be incurred and is a result of the
supplies made in the past. Accordingly, following the principles laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court supra, there is no doubt that the amount is a
certainty for payment and has been incurred in the current previous year. Thus
it cannot be termed as an unascertained liability.
62 63
ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 32.2.4. When the assessee sells his goods, the warranty
clause is part of the sale transaction and therefore it is a committed
liability by the assessee at the very initial stage of sale. But for
prescription of such a warranty clause, the customer may not even buy the
product of the assessee. In the instant case, the assessee had given the
figures of actual warranty liability incurred and paid in the previous years
which forms the basis of existence of warranty liability in the past. Now it
would be pertinent to get into Clause 19 of the Purchase Order dated 16.2.2010
issued by WBSEDCL to the assessee defining the terms and conditions of
contract. The ld DR vehemently relied on this clause as it only mentioned
about 'Guarantee' and there was no clause for 'warranty' in the terms and
conditions. Accordingly the ld DR objected to the allowability of provision
for warranty in the sum of Rs 1,85,85,000/-. For the sake of convenience, the
relevant clause 19 under the caption 'Guarantee' is reproduced hereunder:-
> 19\. Guarantee:
> a) The Meters and Pilfer Proof Meter Boxes shall be guaranteed arising out
> faulty design, materials, bad workmanship for a period of 5-1/2 years from
> the date of supply. The meters / Pilfer Proof Meter Boxes found defective
> within the above guarantee period should be replaced by the supplier free of
> cost within one month on receipt of intimation. If the defective meters /
> Pilfer Proof Meter Boxes are not replaced within the above specified period,
> WBSEDCL will recover twice the cost of meters /Pilfer Proof Meter Boxes from
> the supplier.
> b) Name plate of the meter is to be marked with 'Guarantee of the Meter' :
> 5- 1/2 years from the date of supply.
We find from the above clause, the warranty clause is inbuilt in the Guarantee
Clause itself. As it could be seen that the assessee in the event of any
defective supply within a period of 5-1/2 years had to replace the meters to
WBSEDCL and in the event of meters not getting replaced, then the assessee has
to pay twice the cost of meters to WBSEDCL. Hence it could be safely concluded
that the assessee had agreed for both  63 64 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 warranty (i.e replacement of defective meters) as well as
guarantee ( of paying twice the cost of meters if meters are not replaced).
Hence we hold that the reliance placed by the ld DR does not advance the case
of the revenue and actually it favours the assessee. We also find that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd vs CIT
reported in 314 ITR 62 (SC) had held as under:-
> 11\. Liability is defined as a present obligation arising from past events,
> the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the
> enterprise of resources embodying economic benefits.
> 12\. A past event that leads to a present obligation is called as an
> obligating event. The obligating event is an event that creates an
> obligation which results in an outflow of resources. It is only those
> obligations arising from past events existing independently of the future
> conduct of the business of the enterprise that is recognized as provision.
> For a liability to qualify for recognition there must be not only present
> obligation but also the probability of an outflow of resources to settle
> that obligation. Where there are a number of obligations (e.g., product
> warranties or similar contracts) the probability that an outflow will be
> required in settlement, is determined by considering the said obligations as
> a whole. In this connection, it may be noted that in the case of a
> manufacture and sale of one single item the provision for warranty could
> constitute a contingent liability not entitled to deduction under section 37
> of the said Act. However, when there is manufacture and sale of an army of
> items running into thousands of units of sophisticated goods, the past event
> of defects being detected in some of such items leads to a present
> obligation which results in an enterprise having no alternative to settling
> that obligation. In the present case, the appellant has been manufacturing
> and selling Valve Actuators. They are in the business from assessment years
> 1983-84 onwards. Valve Actuators are sophisticated goods. Over the years
> appellant has been manufacturing Valve Actuators in large numbers. The
> statistical data indicates that every year some of these manufactured
> Actuators are found to be defective. The statistical data over the years
> also indicates that being sophisticated item no customer is prepared to buy
> Valve Actuator without a warranty. Therefore, warranty became integral part
> of the sale price of the Valve Actuator(s). In other words, warranty stood
> attached to the sale price of the product. These aspects are important. As
> stated above, obligations arising from past events have to be recognized as
> provisions. These past events are known as obligating events. In the present
> case, therefore, warranty provision needs to be recognized because the
> appellant is an enterprise having a present obligation as a result of past
> events resulting in an outflow of resources. Lastly, a reliable estimate can
> be made of the amount of the obligation. In short, all three conditions for
> recognition of a provision are satisfied in this case.

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 Hence we hold that the provision for warrant in the sum
of Rs 1,85,85,000/- is an ascertained liability based on the claims made by
WBSEDCL during the year under appeal for which the liability to incur the same
had definitely arisen during the year under appeal and accordingly eligible
for deduction in the year of arising of liability.
32.2.5. There is no dispute with regard to the actual warranty cost incurred
by the assessee in the sum of Rs 8,04,000/- and hence the same represents
crystallized liability during the year which is allowable as deduction.
32.2.6. With regard to the remaining provision for warranty of Rs 12,79,000/-,
we find from page 1380 of Part 3 of Paper Book, that the assessee had arrived
at this figure based on scientific method on a very conservative approach by
taking the average of actual warranty liability incurred in the past 10 years
. The said workings were very much filed before the lower authorities. Hence
we hold that the said sum represents ascertained liability during the year
under appeal, although the actual quantification of the same would arise in
future. It is well settled that if the assessee is following mercantile system
of accounting, if the business liability has definitely arisen in accounting
year, deduction should be allowed although liability may have to be quantified
and discharged at a future date but what should be definite is incurring of
liability. It is not in dispute that the assessee is following mercantile
system of accounting. This principle has been endorsed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Bharat Earth Movers vs CIT reported in 245 ITR 428 (SC).
Hence we hold that this liability of Rs 12,79,000/- is an ascertained
liability in the year under appeal based on the systematic historical data of
the past wherein warranty liabilities had occurred to the assessee. Reliance
in this regard is again placed on yet another finding of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd vs CIT reported in 314 ITR
62 (SC) wherein it was held as under:-
65 66
> ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12
> 17\. At this stage, we once again reiterate that a liability is a present
> obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to
> result in an outflow of resources and in respect of which a reliable
> estimate is possible of the amount of obligation. As stated above, the case
> of Indian Molasses Co. (P.) Ltd. (supra) is different from the present case.
> As stated above, in the present case we are concerned with an army of items
> of sophisticated (specialised) goods manufactured and sold by the assessee
> whereas the case of Indian Molasses Co. Ltd. (supra) was restricted to an
> individual retiree. On the other hand, the case of Metal Box Co. of India

> estimated liability on actuarial valuation. It had made provision for such

> existed in some of the items manufactured and sold then the provision made
> for warranty in respect of the army of such sophisticated goods would be

> over last decade.
(UNDERLINING IS PROVIDED BY US) 32.2.7. Accordingly we hold that the entire
provision for warranty in the sum of Rs 206.68 lakhs would be squarely allowed
as deduction in the year under appeal under the normal provisions of the Act.
66 67
ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 32.2.8. The next dispute in this regard is as to whether
the said provision for warranty would have to be construed as ascertained
liability or unascertained liability for computing the book profits u/s 115JB
of the Act. We have already held that all the three categories of provision
for warranties (i.e 185.85 lakhs , 12.79 lakhs and 8.04 lakhs) are clearly
ascertained liabilities and hence there is no question of adding back the same
to the net profits as per profit and loss account for computing the book
profits u/s 115JB of the Act. We have already held that the liability towards
provision for warranty has been incurred by the assessee during the year under
appeal although the actual quantification of the same arises in future date.
Once it is held that there is a liability which is certain, the same
automatically falls outside the ambit of unascertained liabilities
contemplated in the Explanation to section 115JB of the Act and accordingly
the same would be allowed as deduction while computing the book profits u/s
115JB of the Act. In our considered opinion, the said clause in provided in
section 115JB of the Act only to prevent assessees from making some ad hoc
provisions in the books , which would never crystallize , so as to reduce the
net profits as per the books with consequential reduction in the tax payable
u/s 115JB of the Act. That is not the case here and that is not the allegation
also raised by the revenue in this case. The assessee herein had made
provision for warranty based on a systematic and scientific working and method
by taking into account the past history of incurrence product warranties and
the said workings were also filed before the lower authorities. Hence it could
be safely concluded that the said provision for warranty is not made based on
ad hoc provision. Rather it has got a sound basis and judgment on the part of
the assessee creating an obligating event on the assessee as a result of past
events. We find that this provision would also not tantamount to provision
made for diminution in value of assets.
32.2.9. We would like to place reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of CIT vs Becton Dickinson India (P) Ltd reported in
(2013) 29 taxmann.com 80 (Delhi) dated 19.11.2012 wherein it was held as
under:-

> ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12
> 6\. In the facts of the present case too this Court is of the opinion that
> the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal cannot be found fault with. The
> considerations which weighed with the Supreme Court in Rotork Controls India
> (P.) Ltd.'s case (supra) in concluding such warranty provisions were not
> contingent liabilities would apply with greater force to negate the claim by
> the revenue that such provisions are made for diminution in the value of any
> asset, so as to be covered by Explanation 1(i) to section 115JB of the Act.
> In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that no substantial question
> of law arises for consideration.
Similar view was also taken by the co-ordinate bench decision of Mumbai
Tribunal in the case of Anchor Electricals (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2015)
81 taxmann.com 250 (Mumbai-Trib.) dated 26.4.2017 in the context of
allowability of provision for warranty vis a vis computation of book profits
u/s 115JB of the Act. It was held that :-
> 23\. With regard to the adjustment in book profit u/s115JB is concerned, it
> is noted that this issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee by
> the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Becton Dickinson
> India (P) Ltd. (supra), wherein it has been held that the provision for
> warranty cannot be treated as provision for diminution in value of any
> assets so as to be covered by Explanation 1(i) to section 115JB (2) and thus
> no additions to book profit can be made. Further, Hon'ble Supreme Court in
> the case of Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd. (supra) held that amount of
> provision made on account of warranty expenses cannot be said to be
> unascertained liability. Thus, taking into account both these decisions, we
> find that no addition could have been made u/s 115JB for this amount.
> Therefore, addition to book profit is directed to be totally deleted.
32.3. In view of the aforesaid findings and respectfully following the
judicial precedents relied upon hereinabove, we hold that the provision for
warranty in the sum of Rs 206.68 lakhs would be allowed as deduction under
normal provisions of the Act as well as while computing book profits u/s 115JB
of the Act. Accordingly, the Grounds 11 & 16 raised by the assessee for the
Asst Year 2011-12 are allowed.

33\. The next issue to be decided in this appeal of the assessee is as to
whether the ld DRP was justified in upholding the disallowance made in the sum
of Rs 10,00,472/- on account of provision for obsolescence of inventory in the
facts and circumstances of the case. The interconnected ground is as to
whether the same would have to be added back while computing book profits u/s
115JB of the Act.
33.1. The ld AO observed that the assessee claimed deduction on account of
provision for obsolescence of raw materials of Rs 10,00,472/- (being the
provision made for the year under appeal) in the return of income in respect
of old and dead stocks which has got no realizable value. It was explained
that assessee had converted into static meters as per the mandate of West
Bengal Electricity Department. However, it was holding certain old stocks for
years in view of the fact, that there might be some liability for replacement
of those old stocks in respect of sales made in the earlier years pursuant to
warranty clause prevailing in the old agreements. For this purpose, it had to
maintain sufficient quantity of inventories even though it is old and not
presently usable in the line of business of assessee. However, the same had
become obsolete compared to the present line of business of the assessee and
accordingly thought it fit to make a provision for those inventories on
account of diminution. The detailed workings in this regard were duly filed
before the ld AO which has been acknowledged by him in the assessment order
which are enclosed in pages 1185 to 1189 of Part 3 of Paper Book. The ld AO
disallowed the same treating the same as an unascertained liability under
normal provisions of the Act as well as while computing the book profits u/s
115JB of the Act. This action of the ld AO was upheld by the ld DRP by holding
as under in page 21 of his order :-
> The details of the date of manufacture of meters, etc with batch numbers and
> quality control number which had become obsolete were not available on
> record. Similar other details establishing the rational nexus between the
> obsolete inventories of Rs 10,00,472/- and the specific manufactured items
> becoming obsolescent were not  69 70 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549
> & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 maintained by the A' also. The related details which
> were required to be maintained by the A' to establish its connection with
> the obsolete inventories were as under:-
> 1) Date of manufacture of such electricity meters, etc with batch and
> quality control inspection numbers.
> 2) The reasons why such inventories were treated as obsolete.
> 3) The authorities certifying that such inventories had become obsolete.
> 4) The technical qualifications and the competency of such authorities to
> declare the inventories as obsolete.
> 5) The stock register containing the details and descriptions of the stocks
> becoming obsolete.
> 6) The proof of physical verification of the inventories part of which was
> found to be obsolete.
> Since the above details were not maintained by the A' the Panel has no
> hesitation in inferring that there being no proof of actual verification of
> the inventories leading to detection of inventories worth Rs 10,00,472/- as
> obsolete the provision made was unascertained.
33.2. Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us vide Grounds 10 & 15\.
33.3. We have heard the rival submissions. From the perusal of the materials
available on record, we find that the assessee has created a provision for
obsolete inventories amounting to Rs 10,00,472/- during the year following the
mandate provided in Accounting Standard (AS) 2 issued by Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on 'Valuation of Inventories' , wherein,
while creating such provision, i.e the method of valuation of stock should be
cost or net realizable value whichever is lower. The ld AR stated that the
items of obsolete stock are identified from the system maintained by the
assessee . The system captures the slow moving inventories nad thereafter the
realizable value of the stock is considered vis a vis the cost of those items.
The items of inventory identified are those items which have lost their
consumer acceptability over a period of time and hence are considered
obsolete. The realizable market value considered for comparison is determined
based upon prevalent prices and is the only practical method for comparison
and subsequent evaluation whether an item of inventory has become obsolete or
not. He stated that the method for determining the  70 71 ITA Nos.584 &
687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 item of obsolete inventory being a scientific and
commercially acceptable method and the provision created based thereupon
indicate that the loss has actually incurred in the current period and it is
only its actual quantification which is not possible and hence the provision
is recorded in the books. We find from the workings of provision for obsolete
stocks furnished before the lower authorities by the assessee (enclosed in
pages 1185 to 1189 of Part 3 of Paper Book) that the assessee had adopted
different percentage of provision for obsolete stocks depending upon the
different time periods from the date of sale as under:-
    Upto 180 days                - 0% provision
    181-360 days                 - 25% provision - Rs 2,83,815.18
    361-540 days                 - 50% provision - Rs       7,970.69
    541-720 days                 - 75% provision - Rs 1,75,572.98
    > 720 days                   - 100% provision -Rs 5,33,113.50
                           Total Provision             Rs 10,00,472.35
We find from the said workings , the assessee had clearly mentioned the item
code, description of item available in the inventories, date of last
transaction, quantity, rate per unit and the value together with the time
periods from the date of sale to decide the relevant provision percentage.
Hence it could be safely concluded that the assessee had made a scientific
calculation for making provisions based on commercially acceptable method. We
find that the valuation of the stocks in accordance with AS-2 issued by the
ICAI is one of the standards recognized u/s 145(2) of the Act, wherein the
closing stock is to be valued at lower of cost or net realizable value.
33.3.1. We find that this issue is directly covered in favour of the assessee
by the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs Hotline
Teletube & Components Ltd reported in (2008) 175 Taxman 286 (Delhi) . The
facts before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the decision rendered thereon
are as under:-

> A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 3.1 The assessee had filed a return on 20-10-2002
> declaring a loss of Rs. 51,031. The case of the assessee was picked up for
> scrutiny and a notice under section 143(2) of the Act was issued. During the
> course of the assessment, it came to light that the assessee is in the
> business of manufacture of picture tubes of black and white television sets,
> as well as, glass shells for black and white picture tubes, electron gun and
> glass stems. 3.2 During the course of the assessment proceedings, the
> Assessing Officer sought explanation from the assessee with regard to

> also sought the assessee's explanation as to why the provision be not added

33.3.2. In view of our aforesaid findings and respectfully following the
judicial precedent relied upon hereinabove, we hold that the provison made for
obsolete stocks in the sum of Rs 10,00,472/- is squarely allowable as
deduction as a business loss under normal provisions of the Act. Accordingly,
the Ground No. 10 raised by the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is allowed.

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 33.3.3. With regard to the allowability of the provision
for obsolete stock while computing the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act, the
ld AO had disallowed the same on the ground that it is an unascertained
liability and accordingly to be added back while computing book profits u/s
115JB of the Act. The ld DR argued that pursuant to the amendment brought in
by the Finance (No.2) Act , 2009 with retrospective effect from 1.4.2001 , the
said provision for obsolete stock represents provision made for diminution in
value of asset and hence the same requires to be added back while computing
the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act. When this was put to the ld AR, he
fairly conceded for the addition u/s 115JB of the Act. Moreover, we find that
the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court supra was rendered on 11.8.2008
which was prior to the amendment brought in by Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 with
retrospective effect from 1.4.2001. Accordingly, the Ground No. 15 raised by
the assessee for the Asst Year 2011-12 is dismissed.
34\. The last issue to be decided in this appeal is as to whether the ld DRP
was justified in upholding the addition made on account of provision for
interest on MSMED in the sum of Rs 29,21,911/- in the facts and circumstances
of the case.
34.1. The ld AO observed that assessee had made provision for interest to the
tune of Rs 29,21,911/- for making delayed payment to its suppliers who are
registered under The Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act,
2006 . This provision for interest in the sum of Rs 29,21,911/- was
voluntarily disallowed by the assessee in the return of income under normal
provisions of the Act but deduction was claimed under computation of book
profits u/s 115JB of the Act. The ld AO treated the same as an unascertained
liability and added back the same while computing the book profits u/s 115JB
of the Act. This action of the ld AO was upheld by the ld DRP. Aggrieved, the
assessee is in appeal before us vide Ground No. 14.

A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 34.2. We have heard the rival submissions. We find that
as per the provisions of The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development
Act, 2006, any amount due to the supplier as defined in section 2(n) of the
MSMED Act, should be paid on the date agreed upon between the buyer and the
seller, which shall be before the appointed date as per section 15 of MSMED
Act. Section 16 of the said Act provides that in case the buyer (i.e the
assessee herein) fails to make the payment to the supplier , then the buyer
shall be responsible to pay interest at monthly intervals on the amount due to
the supplier from the appointed date at three times the bank rate notified by
the Reserve Bank of India. Accordingly, the ld AR argued that the liability
towards interest can in no way be termed as an unascertained liability as it
gets crystallized pursuant to an independent statute. He stated that the term
'ascertained' as defined in the Oxford Dictionary means "find out, definite,
certain". He stated that as per the method prescribed in the MSMED Act, 2006,
there cannot be an iota of doubt that the interest calculated and due towards
the suppliers is an ascertained liability. It is calculated as per a set
formula and based on the number of days of payment overdue and hence it has to
be construed as a certain liability and not as a contingent one and
accordingly he prayed for allowance of the same as deduction while computing
the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act.
34.2.1. As per Section 23 of the said Act, the said provision for interest is
not allowable as a deduction under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and
accordingly, the assessee had rightly disallowed the same in the return of
income under normal provisions of the Act. Now the short point of dispute in
this regard is whether the said provision for interest would have to be
disallowed even in the computation of book profits u/s 115JB of the Act. The
ld DR stated that the provisions of section 115JB of the Act are also part of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 only and once section 23 of the MSMED Act, 2006
specifically states that the said interest shall not be allowed as deduction
under Income Tax Act, it should not be allowed as deduction even in the
computation of book profits  74 75 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 &
619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 u/s 115JB of the Act. The ld DR argued that only then the
real intent of the provisions of section 23 of MSMED Act would get sanctified.
34.2.2. We find that though the provisions of section 115JB of the Act are
self contained code in itself and starts with a non-obstante clause creating a
legal fiction regarding the total income of the assessee. The provisions of
section 115JB of the Act have been introduced in the statute book with effect
from 1.4.2001. The MSMED Act, 2006 received the assent of the Hon'ble
President of India on 16.6.2006. The Provisions of Section 23 of MSMED Act ,
2006 are reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of convenience:-
> 23\. Interest not to be allowed as deduction from income Notwithstanding
> anything contained in the Income Tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961), the amount of
> interest payable or paid by any buyer, under or in accordance with the
> provisions of this Act, shall not, for the purposes of computation of income
> under the Income-Tax Act, 1961, be allowed as deduction.
34.2.3. The Provisions of section 23 of MSMED Act, 2006 also starts with non-
obstante clause by stating 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the Income
Tax Act, 1961'. In this regard, it was argued by the ld DR that the wisdom of
the legislators need to be accepted that the Parliament ought to have
considered the provisions of the earlier Act while legislating the new Act.
Obviously the MSMED Act was legislated and assent of the Hon'ble President of
India obtained only on 16.6.2006 which is much after the Income Tax Act, 1961
and section 115JB of the Act contained therein. Going by the intention behind
enacting the MSMED Act, i.e to protect the interests of the micro, small and
medium enterprises that they get their dues in time for the supplies made by
them and they don't get exploited by the big corporates or bigger players in
the market,  75 76 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s
Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 this payment of interest to those suppliers were provided
in the MSMED Act. But we would like to state that the issue before us is to be
decided as per the provisions contained in section 115JB of the Act. It is not
in dispute that the revenue had sought to add back the provision for interest
in the sum of Rs 29,21,911/- while computing the book profits u/s 115JB of the
Act by treating the same only as an unascertained liability falling in clause
(c ) of Explanation 1 to section 115JB(2) of the Act. For the sake of
convenience, the said clause (c ) is reproduced below:-
> Explanation 1 - For the purposes of this section, "book profit' means the
> net profit as shown in the profit and loss account for the relevant previous
> year prepared under sub-section (2) , as increased by -
> (a) to (b) .........................
(c ) the amount or amounts set aside to provisions made for meeting
liabilities, other than ascertained liabilities 34.2.4. Now the pertinent
question would be whether the provision for interest of Rs 29,21,911/- would
be ascertained or unascertained liability. We find that the said provision had
been determined with reasonable certainty pursuant to the method of
calculation provided under the MSMED Act, 2006 (which is an independent
statute) . Moreover, the payment of this interest to the suppliers registered
under MSMED Act, 2006 is mandatory in nature and no option is given to the
assessee in this regard. Hence it could be safely concluded that the said
provision of interest would be clearly an ascertained liability. Moreover, we
find that out of total provision of Rs 29,21,911/-, the assessee has paid a
sum of Rs 10,71,467/- before the end of the previous year and the balance
outstanding as on 31.3.2011 was only Rs 18,50,444/- which is quite evident
from the annual report enclosed in the paper book of the assessee. This itself
proves that the assessee had already discharged partial liability towards
interest within the end of the previous year and unless the liability had
crystallized, no assessee would come  76 77 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 forward to make payment of the same. Hence we hold that
it is only an ascertained liability as on 31.3.2011.
34.2.5. We find that the provisions of section 115JB of the Act stipulates
that 'Book Profits' shall be deemed to be the total income of the assessee.
The expression 'Book Profits' is defined in Explanation 1 to section 115JB of
the Act which states as under:-
> For the purposes of this section, "book profit' means the net profit as
> shown in the profit and loss account for the relevant previous year prepared
> under sub- section(2) , as increased by -
> (a) to (k) ...........................
> If any amount referred to in clauses (a) to (i) is debited to the profit and
> loss account or if any amount referred to in clause (j) is not credited to
> the profit and loss account, and as reduced by , -
> ............................
Once the expression "Book Profits" is defined in section 115JB of the Act, we
cannot travel beyond what is defined therein and we cannot impute any other
words or provisions therein unless otherwise specified by the statute .
Reliance in this regard is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Apollo Tyres Ltd reported in 255 ITR 273 (SC). Admittedly the
interest payable to suppliers under MSMED Act, 2006 is not one of the item
contemplated for addition to net profit for the purpose of computing book
profits u/s 115JB of the Act. It is well settled that provisions of section
115JB of the Act creates a deeming fiction and there cannot be deeming fiction
on an existing deeming fiction by imputing the provisions of section 23 of
MSMED Act, 2006 into the expression "book profits" as defined in Explanation 1
to Section 115JB of the Act. We find that there is no other clause provided in
Explanation (1) to section 115JB(2) of the Act for increasing the book profits
of the assessee due to this provision for interest under MSMED Act, 2006.
Moreover, we find that the provisions of section 23 of MSMED Act, 2006
specifies that interest payable to buyer  77 78 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 shall not for the purposes of computation of income under
the Income Tax Act, 1961, be allowed as deduction. In this regard, the
expression ' computation of income' used therein , in our considered opinion,
refers to the expression 'income' referred to in section 29 or in section 57
of the Income Tax Act. We find that Section 29 and Section 57 of the IT Act,
1961 talks about the manner in which the income referred to in section 28 (i.e
business or professional income) and section 56 (i.e income from other
sources) subject to grant of certain deductions under the respective heads.
For the sake of convenience, the provisions of section 29 and section 57 are
reproduced hereunder:-
> Section 29 \- Income from profits and gains of business or profession, how
> computed The income referred to in section 28 shall be computed in
> accordance with the provisions contained in sections 30 to 43D.
> Section 57- The income chargeable under the head 'income from other sources'
> shall be computed after making the following deductions, namely -
> ..........................
34.2.6. In our considered opinion, what section 23 of MSMED Act, 2006
contemplates or refers to was the 'income' mentioned in section 29 and 57 of
the Act i.e how the interest payable under MSMED Act, 2006 shall be treated
while computing the income from business or profession u/s 29 or while
computing the income from other sources u/s 57 of the Act. It cannot be
stretched to extend to the provisions of section 115JB of the Act which is a
deeming fiction, wherein the book profits shall be deemed to be the 'total
income' of the assessee. The expression 'total income' as used in section
115JB of the Act cannot be equated with 'computation of income' used in
section 23 of MSMED Act, 2006.. It can be appropriately used only in the
context of provisions of section 29 and section 57 of the Act. Thus while
computing the income under normal  78 79 ITA Nos.584 & 687/Kol/2015 ITA
Nos.549 & 619/Kol/2016 M/s Landis + Gyr Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 & 11-12 provisions under various heads alone, the provisions of
section 23 of MSMED Act, 2006 would assume relevance and significance. Hence
we hold that the interest payable under MSMED Act, 2006 need not be added back
to the net profits while computing book profits u/s 115JB of the Act.
Moreover, the ld AR also placed the scrutiny assessment orders of the assessee
on record for the Asst Year 2014-15 u/s 143(3) of the Act dated 26.12.2016,
wherein this aspect has been duly examined by the ld AO in the assessment and
deduction was duly granted by him in the assessment. In view of these facts
and findings, we hold that the provision for interest payable to suppliers
registered under MSMED Act, 2006 in the sum of Rs 29,21,911/- is only an
ascertained liability and need not be added back to the book profits computed
u/s 115JB of the Act. Accordingly, the Ground No. 15 raised by the assessee
for Asst Year 2011-12 is allowed.

directions are given to the Learned AO u/s 144C(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961

the years are identical in nature, they are taken up together and disposed off
by this common order for the sake of convenience.

adjourned to 16.8.2017. We are given to understand from the statement of the
ld DR that he had applied for Earned Leave from 16.8.2017. Since the counsel

present on 16.8.2017 for completion of these appeals after cancellation of his
