7\. In such circumstances, the moot question is : whether .
the Court in such like cases can quash the proceedings ? The law on this
subject has been summed up in a recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Narinder Singh & Ors. V. State of Punjab & Anr. JT 2014 (4) SC 573, wherein
it was held as under:
> "(I) Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished
> from the power which lies in the Court to compound the offences under
> Section 320 of the Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High
> Court has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those
> cases which are not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter
> between themselves. However, this power is t to be exercised sparingly and
> with caution. (II) When the parties have reached the settlement and on that
> basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding
> factor in such cases would be to secure:
> (i) ends of justice, or
> (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. While exercising the
> power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two
> objectives. (III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions
> which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
> like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and

8\. It would be seen that prior to Narinder Singh's case (supra), a three
Hon'ble Judges Bench had considered the relevant scope of Sections 482 and 320
Cr.P.C. in Gian Singh versus State of Punjab and another (2012) 10 SCC 303,
wherein it was held that power of the High Court in quashing of the criminal
proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent power is distinct
and different from the power of a Criminal Court for compounding offences
under Section 320 Cr.P.C. While exercising inherent power of quashment under
Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity
of the crime and its social impact. It warned the Courts, the High Court for
quashing proceedings in heinous and serious offences of mental depravity,
murder, rape, dacoity etc. which principles have been reported and reaffirmed
in Narinder Singh's case (supra).
9\. Now, the further question remains whether this Court can quash the FIR
where the petitioner has been charged under Sections 452, 342 and 326 IPC.
This question need not detained this Court no longer in view of the judgment
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dimpey Gujral, W/o Vivek Gujral and  :::
Downloaded on - 07/03/2020 20:24:32 :::HCHP 7 others versus Union Territory
through Administrator, UT, .
Chandigarh and others (2013) 11 SCC 497 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court
seized of a case seeking quashment of FIR and its consequential proceedings
wherein the accused had been charged under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307,
452 and 506 IPC and the Hon'ble Supreme Court after relying upon the r to
judgment of Gian Singh's case (supra) held as follows:-
> "7. In certain decisions of this court in view of the settlement arrived at
> by the parties, this court quashed the FIRs though some of the offences were
> non-compoundable. A two Judges' Bench of this court doubted the correctness
> of those decisions. Learned Judges felt that in those decisions, this court
> had permitted compounding of non- compoundable offences. The said issue was,
