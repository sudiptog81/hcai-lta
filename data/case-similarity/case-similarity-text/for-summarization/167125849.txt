essentials which constitute passing off action, by holding as under:
12The three elements of passing off action are the reputation of goods,
possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our
opinion, the same principle, which applies to trade mark, is applicable to
trade name.
13\. In an action for passing off it is usual, rather essential, to seek an
injunction, temporary and ad-interim. The principles for the grant of such
injunction are the same as in the case of any other action against injury
complained of. The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case, availability of
balance of convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury
in the absence of grant of injunction.
Accordingly, both the points are answered in favour of the appellant.
In view of above facts and circumstances, the impugned order of the Court
below is set aside. It is needless to state that the Court below shall dispose
of the suit, after considering the oral and documentary evidence of both
sides, without being influenced by any of the observations made hereunder.

    HONBLE SRI JUSTICE A.RAJASHEKER REDDY          
    CMA No. 784 OF 2015   
    JUDGMENT:   
This appeal is filed challenging the order dated 21.07.2015 passed in
I.A.No.658 of 2014 in O.S.No.1067 of 2014 by the XVI Additional District Judge
and Sessions Judge cum XVI Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Ranga Reddy
District at Malkajgiri, wherein the injunction petition filed by the
respondent/plaintiff was allowed and the defendant was restrained from
manufacturing and selling his product Karl Fisher Reagent under Trade name of
Stable 2Y++, pending disposal of the suit.
2\. Defendant in the suit is the appellant herein. The parties hereinafter
will be referred to as arrayed in the suit.
The plaintiff filed petition under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 CPC read with
Section 151 CPC for grant of ad-interim injunction restraining the defendant
from manufacturing, selling, marketing, advertising, distributing of the
product Karl Fisher Reagent bearing the plaintiffs trade name Stable 2Y++
Single Solution KF Reagent pending disposal of the suit. The plaintiff is a
Private Limited Company incorporated under Companies Act. It has been doing
business of manufacturer of sales of high performance laboratory solvents,
reagents, standard solutions and fine chemicals. By using specific proportion
of Aromatic Heterocyclic Compound with other raw material as ingredients to
produce a Pyridine-free Karl-Fisher Reagent Solution of the strength 5.0 to
6.0 mg/ml of water, with minimum two years stability and as such it is named
as Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent and is being approved for its
stability for a minimum of 2 years from the recognized and authorized
laboratories. The words Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent describe the
produce as to the stability of the produce in the packed bottle for a minimum
period of 2 years. The Managing Director of the plaintiff-company made an
application to Registrar of Trademarks for registering the brand name of the
trade name and same is pending. The plaintiff has been using the said
trademark since the year 2005 onwards and no other company in India using the
same. The plaintiffs trade mark signifies the highest standards of quality,
innovation, reliability, output and integrity.
3\. The proprietor of the defendants Company worked in the plaintiffs Company
as a Marketing Manager for a period of 7 years from the year 2002-2009.
Thereafter, he started a separate business and imitated the label, the trade
name of the product Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent and packed the
product in a similar looking bottle and packing case and selling the same in
the open market exhibiting as if the product being sold by the defendant as of
his own product similar to that of the plaintiffs product with an intention to
create confusion and deception in the minds of the customers and with an
ulterior motive to injure his business, reputation and goodwill. That the said
action of the defendant came to the knowledge of the plaintiff in the first
week of September, 2014 and on that the plaintiff procured a sample of the
product manufactured and marketed by the defendant. The act of defendant
amounts to gross misrepresentation and passing off of goods branded
deceptively in the name of the plaintiffs Company. Hence petition for
injunction as noted above.
4\. The defendant filed counter denying the allegations in the affidavit filed
in support of the petition stating that there cannot be a passing off for a
product KF Reagent as the origin inventor was one Mr.Karl Fisher, who is a
German Chemist. The KF Reagent itself indicates the person Karl Fisher
Reagent. The word Single Solution is a common English word and no one can
claim proprietorship over the same. Further the word connotes that there is
only one solution as an old process Pyridine which has two solutions. The
words Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent significantly describes as to the
stability of the product in the packed bottle which is for a minimum period of
two years. Thus, the trade mark is an indicative of the nature of the product
which is a generic word and the plaintiff has no exclusive rights over the
generic words. The registered partnership firm of the defendant consists of
four partners, constituted for the purpose of doing business of manufacturing
and trading of all types of industrial and laboratory chemicals, laboratory
glassware and laboratory instruments. The defendant is doing business since
the year 2014 onwards. One of the partners of the defendant firm was former
employee of the plaintiff. In the year 2009, the said partner left the
services of the plaintiff and started M/s. Shine Chem Laboratories in the year
2014 for the purpose of manufacturing Karl Fisher Reagent and doing business
in the said product. That most of the chemical companies are manufacturing
Karl Fisher Reagent without pyridine in their style of process, as such, Karl
Fisher Reagent without Pyridine has become a generic product and it is not an
invention of anybody. The product packed in the bottle will be shown in the
symbolic 2Y, 2Y++ or 5Y etc., Thus, the usage of 2Y++ along with a trade mark
of the plaintiff does not confer any right over it. That the application of
the plaintiff for registration is still pending and the same does not qualify
for being registered under Section 9 of Indian Trade Marks Act, 1999 as the
trade mark is descriptive in nature. The defendant sold its generic Karl
Fisher Reagent with its own conceived and coined Trade Mark of KF 2Y with very
distinctive coloured (yellow) packing slip. Since all the buyers of the
plaintiff are educated, having scientific background, the question of
purchasing the product of the defendant as that of the plaintiffs product does
not arise. The package label of the defendant is distinctive, unique and shall
not have any resemblance with that of the plaintiffs product. The defendant
has his own version of generic product of Karl Fisher Reagent with brand of KF
2Y, which is distinctive and shall not have any similarity or deceptive
similarity with the Trade mark of the plaintiff that is Stable 2Y++. The
defendant has not misrepresented and misused the Trade Mark or good will of
the plaintiff, as such, passing off goods should not be attributed to the
defendant as the product of the plaintiff has not attained secondary meaning.
The Trade Mark of the plaintiff Stable 2Y++ itself is not having the
essentials of a Trade Mark for not having distinctiveness and therefore, the
plaintiff is not entitled for relief of injunction.
5\. The trial Court, after considering the documentary evidence i.e., Exs.P1
to P85 marked on behalf of the plaintiff and Exs.R1 to R5 marked on behalf of
the defendant, granted ad- interim injunction restraining the defendant from
manufacturing, selling and marketing his product Karl Fisher Reagent under
Trade name of Stable 2Y++ pending disposal of the suit. Aggrieved by the same,
present appeal is filed.
6\. Sri Ashok Ram Kumar, learned counsel for the defendant- appellant,
strenuously contended that since the Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent is
nothing but a descriptive nature of the product being reagent and the
plaintiff is questioning the description of the product and not passing off of
a brand. He also contends that there cannot be a claim of proprietorship on a
descriptive terminology as there are several descriptive terminologies such as
Karl Fisher, Pyridine Free, Reagents, Longer Shelf Life, Stability and Single
Solution etc. He also submitted that the trial Court having found that the
defendant is selling its product under Trade Mark KF 2Y and not Stable 2Y++,
erred in restraining the defendant from selling its product of Karl Fischer
Reagent KF 2Y++. That the impugned order will adversely affect the prosperous
business of the defendant and there is likelihood of stamping the defendant as
pirate. He further contended that any mark which is descriptive in nature is
not protected since the same should be allotted to use by different vendors of
the similar product to describe the product in their marketing literature. In
support of his contentions, he relied on the decisions reported in N.R.Dongre
v. Whirlpool Corporation , Cadila Healthcare Ltd., v. Gujarat Co-operative
Milk , Micronix India v. Mr.J.R.Kapoor , Commissioner of Central Excise,
Mumbai v. M/s.Kalvert Foods India Pvt. Ltd., .
7\. On the other hand, learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that
plaintiff-company is the owner of the trade mark Stable 2Y++ Single Solution
KF reagent and enjoying exclusive right over the same. It has been using the
said trade mark since the year 2005 and no other company in India is using the
same trademark. The proprietor of the defendant company is an ex- employee of
the plaintiff company, who worked as Marketing Manager during the years
2002-2009. The trade mark of the plaintiff signifies highest standards of
quality, innovation, reliability, output and integrity. The plaintiff company
has gained enormous goodwill over a period of 10 years in respect of the
product. He further submits that the trade mark of the defendants product is
deceptively similar as that of the trademark of the plaintiffs product, which
is creating any amount of confusion among the customers and there is every
likelihood of the customers believe that the product marketed by the
defendants company in the name of Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent as
that of the product of the plaintiffs company. He further submits that the
defendant wants to trade upon the goodwill, name and reputation of the
plaintiffs company, which it has built-up during the last 10 years and the
conduct of the defendant in branding their product as that of the plaintiffs
product is fraudulent. In support of his submissions, reliance has been placed
on the following decisions: a)Ashwini Chemical Works, Hyderabad v. Aswini
Homeo Pharmacy, R.R.District ; b) T.V.Venugopal v. Ushodaya Enterprises Ltd.,
; c) Dhariwal Industries Ltd., v. M/s.M.S.S. Food Products ; d) Godfrey
Philips India Ltd., v. Girnar Food & Beverages (P) Ltd., ; e) Sri Sai Agencies
Pvt. Ltd., v. Chintala Rama Rao and f) Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah .
8\. In view of above rival contentions, the following points emerge for
consideration in this appeal.
1) Whether the alleged trade mark of the Plaintiffs product is descriptive in
nature and whether the same has attained secondary meaning?
2) If so, whether ad-interim injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff is
liable to be vacated?
9\. POINTS 1 and 2:
It is relevant to extract the provisions of Sections 27 and 134 of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999 reads as under:
27.No action for infringement of unregistered trade mark:
1) No person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent, or to
recover damages for the infringement of an unregistered trade mark.
2) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect rights of action against any
person for passing off goods or services as the goods of another person or as
services provided by another person, or the remedies in respect thereof.
Section 134. Suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before District
Court:
    (1)     No suit.
    a)      For the infringement of a registered trade mark; or
    b)      Relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or
    c)      For passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any
trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs
trade mark, whether registered or unregistered, shall be instituted in any
court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.
A reading of the above provision shows that no action for infringement will
lie in respect of an unregistered trade mark, but recognises the common law
rights of the trade mark owner to take action against any person for passing
off goods as the goods of another person or as services provided by another
person or the remedies thereof. In order to prove passing off by the
defendant, the plaintiff has to establish that the defendant is
misrepresenting to the general public to sell his product as that of the
products of the plaintiff, damaging the business or goodwill of the plaintiff.
9\. A trademark is said to be infringed when a registered trademark is used by
a person who is neither the registered proprietor nor the licensee of the said
trademark in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered.
From the scheme of the Act, it is discernable that trademark infringement
means violation of exclusive rights granted to the registered proprietor under
the Act, to use the same in relation to the goods or services in respect of
which the trademark is registered. Section 29 and Section 30 of the Act,
provides for protection of registered trademark in case the same is infringed
upon by a person not being a registered proprietor or a licensee.
Action for Passing off the goods arises when an unregistered trademark is used
by a person who is not the proprietor of the said trademark in relation to the
goods or services of the trademark owner. Passing off is a tort actionable
under common law and mainly used to protect the goodwill attached with the
unregistered trademarks. It is founded on the basic tenant of law that one
should not benefit from the labour of another. An action for infringement for
registered trademark or tort of passing off for both registered as well as
unregistered trademark are essentially two ways of achieving the same
objectives i.e. protection of goodwill attached with a mark.
10\. A perusal of the averments in the affidavit in respect of the injunction
petition filed by the plaintiff goes to show that the Managing Director of the
defendants company invented the process using specific proportion of aromatic
Heterocyclic Compound with other raw material as ingredients to produce a
Pyridine-free Karl Fisher Reagent solution with minimum two years stability,
which was named as Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF reagent and same has been
approved for its stability, for a minimum of 2 years, from the recognized and
authorized laboratories through lab tests conducted for 2 years by M/s.
Startech Labs, who issued the analysis reports during the period from April,
2003 to March, 2005 and confirmed that the said product has stability for
minimum 2 years. The words Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent
significantly describe the produce as to the stability of the produce in the
packed bottle for a minimum period of 2 years. The unique quality of the
product is described by these words and same was being produced and marketed
by the plaintiff company under the brand name Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF
reagent since 2005\. The said product has attained good reputation among the
customers and goodwill in the business. The products of the plaintiff with
trade name Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent are being advertised and
doing business as such. The plaintiff made application to Registrar of Trade
Marks, Chennai vide TM Application No.2310332 on 04.04.2012 for registering
the trade name Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent which in chemical
equations indicates that the product stability is for a minimum period of 2
years. Moreover, the application made by the plaintiffs company is pending
consideration for registration.
11\. That these averments in the affidavit of the plaintiff go to show that
Stable 2Y++ is a descriptive term for describing the stability of the product
for a minimum period of 2 years and the words Stable 2Y++ is description of
the product regarding stability of the product. As such, it can safely be held
that the words Stable 2y++ indicates description of the product regarding
stability and it is not a trade name.
12\. The words Karl Fisher Reagent is invented by one Karl Fisher, who is a
German Scientist. When once it is not disputed that Karl Fisher who is a
German Scientist invented the Reagent, named as Karl Fisher Reagent, nobody
can claim proprietorship over such invention, as such, the plaintiff cannot
claim proprietorship over Karl Fisher Reagent. As far as the words Single
Solution are concerned, they are in the nature of generic words, and no one is
permitted to claim proprietorship over generic words, unless those words
attain secondary meaning. The entire alleged trademark is clearly indicative
of the nature of the product, which otherwise is a disqualification for
registration under Section 9 (1) (a) of the Act. Section 9(1)
(a) of the Act reads as follows:
> 9\. Absolute grounds for refusal of registration:
(1) The trade marks-
(a) which are devoid of any distinctive character, that is to say, capable of
distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another
person;
> (b) (c ).
> shall not be registered.
A perusal of the trade mark which is sought to be registered under Trade Marks
Act, i.e., Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF reagent, there is no distinctive
character capable of distinguishing the goods with that of the plaintiffs
Stable 2Y++. As such, no exclusive right is conferred on the plaintiff. It is
pertinent to note that the defendant had sold generic Karl Fisher reagent with
its own conceived and coined trade mark of KF 2Y with very distinctive
coloured (Yellow) packing slip and corrugated packaging box and that there is
huge distinction and variation in the phonetics as well as the colour
combination of the labels adopted by both the parties.
13\. A perusal of the said labels of both products show printed matter
pertaining to science, warnings and precautions as well as descriptions and
directions, which are mandatory as per the provisions of law. The packing of
the product of plaintiff is in blue colour and the packing of the defendants
is in yellow colour. Moreover, the logo used by the plaintiff is Standard
Reagents and the defendant is using its logo as Shine Chem Laboratories. As
such, the contention of the plaintiff that the labels used by the defendant
are deceptively similar to that of plaintiffs, cannot be accepted. There is a
substantial difference between both the labels i.e., KF Reagent used by the
defendants product and Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF Reagent used by the
plaintiffs product. Since the product of the defendant is sold as KF Reagent,
there is no passing off as alleged by the plaintiff.
a) In N.R.Dongre and others v. Whirlpool Corporation and another (supra), the
Honble Apex Court held as follows:
An infringement action is available where there is violation of specific
property right acquired under and recognised by the statute. In a passing- off
action, however, the plaintiffs right is independent of such a statutory right
to a trade mark and is against the conduct of the defendant which leads to or
is intended or calculated to lead to deception Passing- off is said to be a
species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading by which
one person, through deception, attempts to obtain an economic benefit of the
reputation which another has established for himself in a particular trade or
business. The action is regarded as an action for deceit. The tort of passing-
off involves a misrepresentation made by the trader to his prospective
customers calculated to injure, as a reasonably foreseeable consequence, the
business or goodwill of another which actually or probably, causes damages to
the business or good of the other trader.....".
In the above cited judgment, suit is in the nature of passing off action filed
by the respondents to restrain the appellants from manufacturing, selling,
advertising or in any way using the trade mark Whirlpool in their product
(washing machine) deceptively or confusingly. In the said case, the respondent
has long association with the word Whirlpool who acquired trans-India
reputation in respect of the same and that there was no reliable evidence of
the appellants having marketed their product in that name for a considerable
length of time and that irreparable injury would be caused to respondents
reputation and goodwill as the product of appellants baring that mark was of
lower standard and quality. Accordingly, the Honble Supreme Court, confirmed
the injunction granted by the High Court in favour of the respondent therein.
No evidence is produced in this case to show that the alleged trademark
attained secondary meaning. In the instant case on hand, plaintiff has also
not produced any evidence to show that the product sold by the defendant is
deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs product thereby causing
irreparable injury to reputation and goodwill of the product of the plaintiff.
b) The Supreme Court in Cadila Healthcare Ltd., v. Gujarat Co\- operative Milk
(supra) laid down certain broad principles, while granting injunction, the
relevant portion is as follows:-
18\. Over the years, the Law of Passing off has gradually undergone a paradigm
shift. Whilst the principles of the Law have not changed in principle, the
judicial approach whilst adjudicating upon an action for passing off has
gradually changed as the Courts have become more circumspective of those who
complain of deception. This is primarily owing to the propensity of traders in
adopting purely descriptive words as trade marks, which, in effect, has a
direct bearing on other potential traders intending to use such descriptive
words for highlighting the characteristic attributes of their products. Though
there is no restrain on traders from using purely descriptive words as trade
marks, any trader who adopts a trade mark of such nature is proscribed by the
cannone of fair competition to claim monopoly or exclusivity in respect of
thereof. Even though an action for passing off, in essence, continues to
protect the distinctiveness associated with trade marks, it has become a
challenge for Courts of law to ensure that no passing off action results in
creating monopoly rights in the use of trade marks which are inherently
descriptive or public Jurisdiction in nature.
51\. It is noteworthy that throughout the course of the proceedings before
this Court, the main plank of the plaintiff's contentions has been that the
right to use a descriptive word even when it has acquired a secondary meaning
would be permissible if and only if that is the only manner in which the
product can be described and in no other. To make good its point, the
plaintiff has proposed various similar permutations and combinations, viz. 'No
Sugar', 'Without Sugar', 'Free of Sugar', etc., using which the defendant can
convey the special attributes of its product Pro Biotic Frozen Dessert. This
contention of the plaintiff per se does not impress me. Simply because a
number of alternatives are available to defendant to describe its product Pro
Biotic Frozen Dessert does not imply that the plaintiff be allowed to arrogate
to itself the monopoly to use the expression 'Sugar Free', especially when the
said expression being inherently descriptive in nature has become public
Jurisdiction in relation to foods and beverages.
54\. It is important to be borne in mind that use of a descriptive expression
as a trade mark by a trader, irrespective of the said trade mark having
acquired a secondary meaning and distinctiveness in relation to the trader's
products, does not entitle such trader from precluding other traders from
using the said expression for the purposes of describing the characteristic
features of their products. I have no hesitation in stating, albeit without
prejudice to the rights and interests of the plaintiff in the present suit,
that by adopting such a purely descriptive and laudatory expression 'Sugar
Free' as its trade mark, the plaintiff must be prepared to tolerate some
degree of confusion which is inevitable owing to the wide spread use of such
trade mark by fellow competitors. Simply because the plaintiff claims to be
using the expression 'Sugar Free' as a trade mark much prior to the launch of
the defendant's product Pro Biotic Frozen Dessert in the market does not give
this Court a good ground for imposing a blanket injunction on the defendant
from using the expression 'Sugar Free', especially when the defendant intends
to use this expression only in its descriptive sense and not as a trade mark,
and even otherwise, when the use of this expression is widespread in relation
to foods and beverages.
57\. No doubt that the confusion emanating from the conspicuous display of the
expression 'sugar free' on the packaging of the defendant's product is hard to
ignore. However, I am afraid that imposing a blanket injunction on the use of
a public Jurisdiction expression like 'sugar free' will inequitably allow the
plaintiff to monopolise the use of such expression, and this, in effect, will
be antithetical to fair competition in trade and commerce. Thus, the
challenge, in essence, before this Court is to provide such relief which would
maintain the balance between the private right of the plaintiff to use the
expression 'Sugar Free' as its trade mark and the larger public right of
traders to use the said expression in its descriptive sense.
As held in Cadila Healthcare Ltd., v. Gujarat Co-operative Milk (supra)
imposing a blanket injunction on the use of a public jurisdiction expression
will be antithetical to fair competition in trade and commerce.
c) In Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai v. M/s.Kalvert Foods India Pvt.
Ltd., (supra), the Honble Supreme Court held as follows:
32\. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid brand name "New Improved Quick
Frozen French Fries" is a descriptive word and the same could not have been
termed and coined either as a "house name" or a "brand name" under any
circumstances. There can be no dispute therefore with regard to the
proposition of law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision..
In the instant case on hand, the use of descriptive words Stable 2y++ Single
Solution KF reagent describes the stability and quality of the product, cannot
be claimed by the respondent/plaintiff as its trade mark, there is every
likelihood of confusion which is inevitable owing to the wide spread use of
such trade mark by fellow competitors. Simply because the respondent/plaintiff
claims to be using the expression Stable 2y++ Single Solution KF reagent as a
trade mark much prior to the launch of the appellants product Stable 2y++ in
the market is not a good ground for imposing a blanket injunction on the
appellant from using the expression 'Stable 2y++, especially when the
appellant/defendant intends to use this expression only in its descriptive
sense and not as a trade mark, and even otherwise. As stated supra, the words
Stable 2Y++ Single Solution KF reagent is descriptive in nature. It has been
held that no one can claim proprietorship over the trade mark in respect of
descriptive words. As such, the appellant/defendant cannot be prevented from
using a descriptive term in its original descriptive sense, unless it has
wholly lost that descriptive sense and become distinctive of the
respondent/plaintiff in every context.
14\. In Ashwini Chemical Works, Hyderabad v. Aswini Homeo Pharmacy,
R.R.District and another (supra), the trade mark of the appellant/defendant
Ashwini is held deceptively similar in sound as that of the trade mark of the
respondents/plaintiffs i.e., Aswini and there is any amount of confusion among
the customers believe that the detergent cake marketed by the
appellant/defendant in the nature of Ashwini as that of respondent/plaintiff.
The purchasers on looking at the product of the appellant/defendant with
trademark Ashwini there is every likelihood of their believing that the
product is that of the respondents/plaintiffs. As the respondents/plaintiffs
therein have satisfied all the essential ingredients for grant of temporary
injunction, the injunction granted in favour of the respondent/plaintiff is
confirmed by this Court.
15\. A descriptive trade mark may be entitled to protection if it has assumed
a secondary meaning which identifies it with a particular product or as being
from a particular source. A mark which is prima facie descriptive will only be
protected if it can be shown to have acquired secondary meaning that is to
say, if it has become distinctive of the respondent/plaintiff. No doubt,
injunction can be granted in respect of passing off action even in respect of
descriptive word when the same has attained secondary meaning as held in
T.V.Venugopal v. Ushodaya Enterprises Ltd.s case (supra), wherein it is held
as follows:
100\. The respondent companys mark Eenadu has acquired extra-ordinary
reputation and goodwill in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Eenadu newspaper and
TV are extremely well known and almost household words in the State of Andhra
Pradesh. The word Eenadu may be a descriptive word but has acquired a
secondary or subsidiary meaning and is fully identified with the products and
services provided by the respondent company.
16\. In Office Cleaning Services Limited v. Westminster Office Cleaning
Association wherein the Court observed that the word office cleaning was held
to be a descriptive word, for it is a descriptive of the business they carry
on. It was held that the plaintiff could assume or establish monopoly on the
said word only when they show that they have acquired a secondary or
subsidiary meaning. But in the present case, no evidence is let in to show
that the Stable 2y++ has attained secondary meaning regarding the product of
the respondent/plaintiff. Moreover, the application for registration of trade
mark applied by the respondent/plaintiff in respect of the subject trade mark,
admittedly is pending and the same has to be considered by the Registrar of
Trade Marks. The trial Court erroneously held that the appellant/defendant has
not placed any material before the Court to show that there is definite
formula to describe the product as Stable 2y++. In fact, the plaintiff himself
stated in the affidavit in support of the injunction petition that the word
Stable 2Y++ is indicative of stability of the product. In fact, the burden of
proof lies on the plaintiff to prove his case.
17\. In Sri Sai Agencies Pvt. Ltd., v. Chintala Rama Rao (supra), this Court
observed that the seller introducing products earlier is entitled for
injunction. It is a case wherein the producers of ghee using the trade marks
as Mathura ghee and Mathurag ghee and the only difference between two trade
marks is alphabet G. Both the trade marks are phonetically similar and there
is not much of difference in pictorial and monogram and the use of trade mark
Mathurag by rival producer commencing after lapse of five years is likely to
deceive and confuse customers. The owner of the trade mark Mathura popularized
his mark by investing huge amount for advertisements, through different media
right from the date of marketing his goods. As such, the prior user of the
product i.e., Mathura is entitled for injunction.
18\. Though the Court below held that Stable 2Y++ is unique style of the
plaintiff to describe its product, but no evidence is placed evidencing the
same. The Court below also found that the defendant is using his product under
trade name KF 2Y and not as Stable 2Y++. When plaintiff is using the trade
mark of KF 2Y, no cause of action arises for granting of injunction, as such,
granting of injunction restraining the defendant from using the trade mark KF
2Y++ is erroneous. A perusal of Exs.P3 to P13 and Exs.R2 to R5 goes to show
that labels and style of font mentioning as Stable 2Y++ and the colour and
logo are also not similar and back ground is also not similar. Besides the
logo, the plaintiff is using the word Standard Reagents whereas the defendant
is using Shine Chem Laboratories. As far as Single Solution is concerned, it
is descriptive word and Stable 2Y++ even according to the plaintiff, is
descriptive in nature. The numeral 2 along with Y++ refers to the stability
period being 2 years and single solution refers to composition of the
solution. The mark Stable 2Y++ Single Solution of the plaintiff does not have
any distinctiveness and the descriptive sentence Single Solution KF Reagent
cannot be called as a proprietary mark or the trademark. Whether the words
Stable 2Y++ has attained secondary meaning regarding the products of the
plaintiff has to be gone into in the suit after evidence is let in by both
parties. In view of above facts and circumstances other decisions relied on by
both sides have no application to the facts of the case.
19\. Apart from above, the plaintiff had not produced any documentary evidence
showing that it has suffered damage or is likely to suffer damage because of
the sale of the product by the defendant as that of the plaintiff. In the
absence of the same, there cannot be any passing-off by the appellant as
claimed by the respondent/plaintiff.
In LAXMIKANT V. PATELs case ( supra), the Supreme Court has explained the
essentials which constitute passing off action, by holding as under:
12The three elements of passing off action are the reputation of goods,
possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our
opinion, the same principle, which applies to trade mark, is applicable to
trade name.
13\. In an action for passing off it is usual, rather essential, to seek an
injunction, temporary and ad-interim. The principles for the grant of such
injunction are the same as in the case of any other action against injury
complained of. The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case, availability of
balance of convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury
in the absence of grant of injunction.
Accordingly, both the points are answered in favour of the appellant.
In view of above facts and circumstances, the impugned order of the Court
below is set aside. It is needless to state that the Court below shall dispose
of the suit, after considering the oral and documentary evidence of both
sides, without being influenced by any of the observations made hereunder.
Accordingly, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is allowed. There shall be no
order as to costs. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any,
pending shall stand closed. ____________________________ A.RAJASHEKER REDDY, J
