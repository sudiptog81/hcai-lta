of the lower Court on issue No.5 also.
Issue No.3 is whether the suit is barred by limitation. It is clear from a
reading of Ex.A.13 order that the Honble High Court of Andhra Pradesh gave
permission to the plaintiff-club for agitating their rights, if any, before
the court of law. This order was passed on 11.09.1987. The suit was filed in
1988. Therefore, this Court holds that the suit is really not barred by
limitation.
As far as issue Nos.3 and 4 are concerned, there is no clear pleading or
evidence. Therefore, this Court concurs with the finding of the lower Court on
issue Nos.3 and 4 and they need not be specifically decided again by this
Court. Issue No.7 is about the general relief.
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the
plaintiff-club has failed to prove its title and possession to the property.
There is no clarity about the actual identity of the property on the ground.
For all the reasons, this Court holds that there are no merits in the appeal
and accordingly the same is dismissed. The judgment and decree dated

    HONBLE SRI JUSTICE D.V.S.S. SOMAYAJULU         
    AS No.176 of 1995 
    JUDGMENT:   
This appeal is filed by the plaintiff against the judgment and decree dated
21.11.1994 passed by the Sub-ordinate Judge, Nalgonda in OS No.62 of 1988.
For the sake of convenience, as this is a first appeal, the parties are
referred to as in the suit only viz., plaintiff and defendants.
The suit is filed by the Silver Jubilee Club, Deverkonda, which is a society
registered under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Pubic Societies
Registration Act, vide registration No.851 of 1974. It is filed against the
State of Andhra Pradesh, the Mandal Revenue Officer, Deverkonda Mandal and 17
other private parties, claiming a declaration of title and perpetual
injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs
possession and property viz., the land and the house bearing No.12-205, 12-206
and 12-207 situated in Survey Nos.669 and 670 of Deverkonda Village and the
refund of an amount of Rs.6,566.20 paise from the second defendant. These are
the main reliefs claimed. The suit schedule property is described clearly as
follows:
Silver Jubilee Club bearing house Nos.12-205, 12-206 and 12-207 with open
place and compound covering survey Nos.669 and 670  measuring in all Ac.7.07
guntas of dry land situated in Devarkonda Village with the following
boundaries:
East : Sri Kodandarama Swamy Temple, West : Private house, North : Gram
Panchayat Road, South : Jadcherla-Nalgonda PWD Road.
This is the specific property for which the relief of declaration and
injunction is sought for. As far as the monetary claim is concerned, it is the
case of the plaintiff-club that they have sold the standing trees to a third
party and at that stage the Government interfered and claimed that the
property is Government property and therefore the amount was paid to the
Government by the auction purchaser. The refund of this amount is now sought
for.
The case of the plaintiff-club is that the property was purchased by them in
the year 1935 from one Gajula Sarabayya under Ex.A.1-sale deed and the club
has been in possession and enjoyment of the suit schedule property. They state
that the Government wrongly mutated the land on which the club is situated in
Jamabandi in 1977-78 as kharij khata land. The plaintiff-club has no notice of
the alleged conversion. Therefore, the suit is filed for a declaration of
title and for other reliefs.
On behalf of the State, the Mandal Revenue Officer, Devarkonda Mandal filed a
written statement stating that the State is the absolute owner of the land and
that the plaintiff-club has no right, title or interest over the property.
While there is no clear pleading against the other private defendants, still
the written statement of the third defendant was filed wherein he set up a
title independently. Similarly, defendants 4 to 19 also filed a written
statement wherein they set up independent title. They clearly dispute the
title of the plaintiff-club. In paragraph-8 of the written statement filed by
the defendants 4 to 19, it is clearly pleaded that the property relating to
the registered sale deed is described as Gollavanimanyam chelka, whereas the
property in which the suit land is situated in Mondichinta chelka. They also
assert the other issues in detail in the written statement.
Based on the above pleadings, the following issues were framed by the lower
Court:
1\. Whether the suit is filed by a properly representing person?
2\. Whether the plaintiff is the owner and possessor of the suit property in
S.Nos.669 and 670 new and S.Nos.557 & 558 old of  Deverkonda village?
3\. Whether the suit is barred by the period of limitation?
4\. Whether the suit property is properly valued and whether court fee paid is
sufficient?
5\. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the auction amount of
Rs.3,025/- with interest, as claimed from the defendants?
6\. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the declaration of title and
perpetual injunction as prayed for?
7\. To what relief is the plaintiff entitled?
Based on these issues, the parties went to trial. For the plaintiff, PWs.1 to
8 were examined and Exs.A.1 to A.14 were marked. For the defendants, DWs.1 to
5 were examined and Exs.B.1 to B.46 were marked. The lower Court after the
trial dismissed the suit. The lower Court also did not believe the case of the
defendants 4 to 19.
This Court has heard Sri K. Mahipathi Rao, learned counsel for the appellant;
the Government Pleader for Appeals for respondents 1 and 2 and Sri C.
Nageswara Rao, learned counsel for the third respondent but none appeared for
respondents 4 to 19.
In this case the essential questions to be decided are in between the
plaintiff-club and the State. The law on the subject regarding the burden of
proof in a suit for declaration is also very well settled. In Union of India
v. Vasavi Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. wherein the Honble Supreme Court of
India clearly held that the burden of proof in a suit for declaration of title
is squarely upon the plaintiff. The plaintiff will have to prove with the
clear and cogent evidence their right, title and interest in a suit for
declaration of title. The failure of the defendant to prove his case or the
weaknesses in the defendants case will not entitle the plaintiff to a decree
as prayed for. The burden is squarely on the plaintiff.
Against this backdrop of the settled legal position, the evidence and the
submissions of both the learned counsel will have to be examined. The main
points that have to be decided are issue Nos.2 and 6, which are to the
following effect:
2\. Whether the plaintiff is the owner and possessor of the suit property in
S.Nos.669 and 670 new and S.Nos.557 & 558 old of  Deverkonda village?
6\. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the declaration of title and
perpetual injunction as prayed for?
In the case on hand, the plaintiff-club has examined eight witnesses and has
marked Ex.A.1 sale deed. Ex.A.1 sale deed is executed in 1935 (fasli-1345). An
examination of Ex.A.1 clearly shows that the land conveyed under Ex.A.1 in
favor of the Silver Jubilee Club is the land measuring Ac.7.07 guntas in
Gollavanimanyam chelka. Ex.A.1 does not have any description of the land with
boundaries. The translation of Ex.A.1 is also filed along with the material
papers as Ex.A.4.
To prove the possession and enjoyment of the property, the witness who was
examined first is PW.3, is the Junior Assistant in the Deputy Registrars
office. He clearly states that in Ex.A.1 or A.4 the boundaries of the property
are not mentioned for the land covered in Survey Nos.557 and 558 (which are
the old survey numbers). The next witness examined is PW.4, who is an advocate
aged about 90 years at the time of his deposition. He deposed that the
plaintiff-club has constructed a building in the land purchased. PW.5 is
another advocate, who is also aged about 90 years at the time of his
deposition as plaintiffs witness. He clearly states that the vendor of Ex.A.1
died and that they constructed a building in some part of the land. He deposes
as follows about the boundaries. On the northern and southern side, they
erected a compound wall on the boundary lines. On the eastern and western
sides of the land, they erected a fencing wire. Now there is a road on the
northern, southern and western sides of the said land. He admits that on the
eastern side, there is a temple of Sri Kodandarama Swamy. He also admits in
his cross-examination that the boundaries of the property are not mentioned in
the registered sale deed nor is any map annexed to the registered sale deed.
This witness was further cross-examined on 23.02.1994 by third defendant. In
his cross-examination, he states that the boundaries are as follows:
East: Office building belonging to the Weavers Cooperative Society, West: Road
and adjoining the patta land of Ramana and Ranga Reddy.
North: Road and after it horizontal.
South: PWD road leading to jadcherla.
The next witness is PW.6, who was the Secretary of the plaintiff-club at that
time. He states that the entire area within the compound is Ac.7.07 guntas. In
his cross-examination, he states that on the western side of the club
premises, there is a road and private buildings. On the eastern side, there is
a temple of Kodandarama Swamy and on the northern side, there is a Gram
Panchayat Road and on the southern side there is a PWD road. The next witness
is PW.7 who says that out of Ac.7.07 guntas of land, some land was acquired in
a road formation and survey. He states that the boundaries are as towards west
and north sides, there is a road; towards south, some other place and dak
bungalow and other lands belonging to us.
On behalf of the defendants, DW.1 was examined. He is the Mandal Revenue
Officer of Devarkonda village. He states that the land in Survey Nos.669 and
670 is kharij khata. He also deposed that the present plaintiff- club filed a
petition before the Commissioner for land revenue who dismissed the same and
they went to the High Court, which has given directions to the plaintiff to
approach the civil Court. Ex.B.1 is the said document.
The evidence of this witness is being considered at this stage, since the suit
is filed for a declaration of title deed and the essential contest is between
the plaintiff- club and the State.
It is an admitted fact that the survey Nos.669 and 670 are the current survey
numbers. The discrepancies in the boundaries were pointed out and relied upon
very strongly by the learned counsel for the respondents/ defendants. In
addition, the lack of identity of the property is also a matter that is
highlighted by the learned counsel for the respondents. The learned counsel
for the respondent/Government also pointed out that the land purchased under
Ex.A.1 is in Gollavanimanyam Chelka, whereas the lands claimed in Survey
Nos.667 and 670 are situated in Mondichinta chelka. The documents filed by the
plaintiff themselves have shown the difference in classification.
To get over this difficulty, the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff-
club relied upon the following judgments.
i) Naresh Chandra Das v. Nirmal Cahnra Das ;
    ii)     S. Nagraj v. Kalluramma ; and
    iii)    Mogulla Ailamma v. Samba Yellaiah . 
The learned counsel also relied upon Order 7 Rule 3 CPC and argued that the
plaint has described with sufficient clarity and that the boundaries need not
be given with clarity. It is also his contention that the subject land can be
identified with certainty. Therefore, he states that the provisions of Order 7
Rule 3 CPC are complied with and that the objections raised by the defendants
are not correct. He also argues that the plaintiffs sale deed of 1935 (Ex.A.1)
is not really disputed by the defendant.
While the case law on Order 7 Rule 3 CPC or the provisions of the Rule are not
really in dispute, the question that arises in this case is about the title;
possession and also the identity/the location of the property in this case.
The boundaries given by the witnesses do not tally with each other. The extent
said to have purchased under Ex.A.1 is not clearly borne out by the record. No
steps were taken to clarify the discrepancies pointed out by defendants 4 to
19 that the land is not situated in Gollavanimanyam chelka. Despite the
written statement of defendants 4 to 19 disputing the location of the land
wherein they clearly pleaded that the land in which the club is situated is
located in Mondichinta chelka and not in Gollavanimanyam chelka, which is
mentioned in Ex.A.1, no steps were taken to clarify this issue. The plaintiff-
club did not take any steps to clarify the actual position on the ground. They
did not get an advocate commissioner appointed to localize the land to
establish the boundaries and/or to show their possession and enjoyment to the
entire extent or of a lesser extent. The building plans and other records
would have contained details of the appurtenant lands also if they were
submitted for approval. They did not file any documents like the plans.
This Court also notices the fact that with the passage of time, boundaries do
undergo some changes when land acquisition, road widening, road formation or
such other factors occur. Similarly, due to the sale of neighbouring lands or
boundaries, encroachments etc., the actual extent of land in old documents or
even the description of the ownership of the adjacent lands or the boundaries
may not tally with the ground realities existing on the date of the suit or
its hearing. In such cases, the burden lies on the party to prove that
original boundaries are no longer available as on the date of hearing etc. by
adducing evidence to show that the boundaries have changed due to certain
reasons like those mentioned above. These reasons are not exhaustive but are
being highlighted to show that these are capable of proof.
In the case on hand, there is absolutely no evidence to support the case set
up by the plaintiff-club that the entire extent of Ac.7.07 guntas is in their
possession and enjoyment. Even the lesser extent as per PW.1 is not proved. In
fact, there is no proof at all of the extent of land or of its clear
possession. The judgment of the Honble Supreme Court which is cited earlier
makes it very clear that the burden always lies on the plaintiff- club to
prove its case in a suit for declaration of title.
In the opinion of this Court, the plaintiff-club has failed to prove its case.
The findings of the lower Court on issue Nos. 2 and 6 are correct. The lower
Court rightly notices that there is no documentary evidence to show that the
plaintiff was enjoying the entire extent of land. The mutation of the names
and the claim and possession of the club over the entire extent with
boundaries is not established. The existence of open land surrounding the
club-buildings has not been proved. Therefore, this Court concurs with the
findings of the lower Court on issue Nos.2 and 6.
Issue No.1 is whether the suit is filed by a properly representing person.
There appears to be an error here. The correct issue is whether the suit is
instituted by a properly authorized person. The plaint was signed and filed by
its Secretary, Sri G. Rami Reddy and an issue was framed about the competence
of plaintiff-club to institute the suit. PW.6 is the Secretary of the
plaintiff- club, who has filed the suit. In the cross-examination, he admits
that the resolution was passed to file a suit in the court of law against the
defendants. He states that he has not filed any document to show that the club
members have authorized him to file the suit. This court notices that the
objection is not taken on the ground that the club is a society and that the
Secretary cannot file the suit. The objection is that the resolution passed by
the club members is not filed into the Court. Further the evidence of this
witness shows that he has been associated with the club since 1985. The plaint
has been filed in the year 1988. Earlier the club has also approached the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh for certain reliefs. In this case also, as can be seen
from Ex.A.13, the club was represented by its Secretary. This Court is also of
the opinion that the plaintiff-club cannot be non- suited on such a hyper
technical ground. As observed by the Honble Supreme Court of India in United
Bank of India v. Naresh Kumar , the mere fact that the power of attorney or a
resolution is not filed should not be a ground to non-sue the plaintiff
totally. The appellant is not an individual but is a society. It has to be
represented by an actual living person who should be someone properly
associated with the society. In this case, PW.6 fulfills all the above
conditions. Even otherwise at an appellate stage a resolution/power of
attorney can be obtained and filed to cure this procedural defect. The fact
remains that the plaintiff has paid the court fee, filed the suit and actively
pursued the case. A number of witnesses associated with the club were
examined. The appeal is also being pursued in this Court. Therefore, this
Court in line with the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court in Naresh Kumars
case (5 supra) holds that there is a deemed ratification of the action taken
to tile the suit. Even as per the provisions Section 7 of the Andhra Pradesh
(Telangana Area) Public Societies Registration Act, 1350F, any suit can be
instituted by the Chairman/"Secretary" or trustee as per the Societys Rules.
Hence, this Court holds that issue No.1 is to be held in favor of the
appellant only.
Issue No.5: This issue is about the refund of the amount of Rs.3,025/- which
is purportedly deposited with the Government. This Court notices that the
plaintiff-club did not prove that it is the owner of the entire land on which
the trees are located. The plaintiff also raised an issue about the sudden
reclassification of the land. The learned counsel for the appellant relied
upon certain passages in the decision of the Honble Supreme Court in
Government of Andhra Pradesh v. Pratap Karan and argued that the Government
did not file any document to show the manner in which the land was classified
and reclassified. The learned counsel relied upon paragraph-78 of said
judgment and argued that there is no proceeding to show how the suit land is
suddenly classified as government land. The judgment of Honble Supreme Court
in Pratap Karans case (6 supra) is very clear, but the fact remains that in
this case, the appellant/plaintiff filed an appeal before the Commissioner of
Land Revenue. The Commissioner clearly held that the appellant is not really
aggrieved by the orders of the reclassification of the land as kharij khata
but is actually aggrieved by the notice issued by the Tahsildar. The
Commissioner clearly held that the action of the Tahsildar in issuing notices
is correct as the property rights in the land were held by the Government.
Therefore, the appeal was rejected. Against the same, the writ petition
bearing No.3342 of 1983 was also filed and the same was dismissed by this
Court and the plaintiff is given liberty to agitate their rights in a
competent civil Court. The said order was marked as Ex.A.13.
In addition, this Court also notices that the relief claimed in the plaint is
only for a declaration of title. The arbitrary conversion or the method of
conversion in the revenue records or their correction are not directly raised
in the plaint nor is any specific issue raised about the same during the
course of the examination of witnesses or in the argument. The plaintiff did
not also seek a relief of correction of the alleged wrong entries in the
revenue records. For all these reasons, this Court concurs with the findings
of the lower Court on issue No.5 also.
Issue No.3 is whether the suit is barred by limitation. It is clear from a
reading of Ex.A.13 order that the Honble High Court of Andhra Pradesh gave
permission to the plaintiff-club for agitating their rights, if any, before
the court of law. This order was passed on 11.09.1987. The suit was filed in
1988. Therefore, this Court holds that the suit is really not barred by
limitation.
As far as issue Nos.3 and 4 are concerned, there is no clear pleading or
evidence. Therefore, this Court concurs with the finding of the lower Court on
issue Nos.3 and 4 and they need not be specifically decided again by this
Court. Issue No.7 is about the general relief.
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the
plaintiff-club has failed to prove its title and possession to the property.
There is no clarity about the actual identity of the property on the ground.
For all the reasons, this Court holds that there are no merits in the appeal
and accordingly the same is dismissed. The judgment and decree dated
21.11.1994 passed by the Sub-ordinate Judge, Nalgonda in OS No.62 of 1988 are
confirmed. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, pending in this appeal shall stand closed.

    AS No.176 of 1995 
    JUDGMENT:   
This appeal is filed by the plaintiff against the judgment and decree dated
21.11.1994 passed by the Sub-ordinate Judge, Nalgonda in OS No.62 of 1988.
For the sake of convenience, as this is a first appeal, the parties are
referred to as in the suit only viz., plaintiff and defendants.
The suit is filed by the Silver Jubilee Club, Deverkonda, which is a society
registered under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Pubic Societies
Registration Act, vide registration No.851 of 1974. It is filed against the
State of Andhra Pradesh, the Mandal Revenue Officer, Deverkonda Mandal and 17
other private parties, claiming a declaration of title and perpetual
injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs
possession and property viz., the land and the house bearing No.12-205, 12-206
and 12-207 situated in Survey Nos.669 and 670 of Deverkonda Village and the
refund of an amount of Rs.6,566.20 paise from the second defendant. These are
the main reliefs claimed. The suit schedule property is described clearly as
follows:
Silver Jubilee Club bearing house Nos.12-205, 12-206 and 12-207 with open
place and compound covering survey Nos.669 and 670  measuring in all Ac.7.07
guntas of dry land situated in Devarkonda Village with the following
boundaries:
East : Sri Kodandarama Swamy Temple, West : Private house, North : Gram
Panchayat Road, South : Jadcherla-Nalgonda PWD Road.
This is the specific property for which the relief of declaration and
injunction is sought for. As far as the monetary claim is concerned, it is the
case of the plaintiff-club that they have sold the standing trees to a third
party and at that stage the Government interfered and claimed that the
property is Government property and therefore the amount was paid to the
of the lower Court on issue No.5 also.
Issue No.3 is whether the suit is barred by limitation. It is clear from a
reading of Ex.A.13 order that the Honble High Court of Andhra Pradesh gave
permission to the plaintiff-club for agitating their rights, if any, before
the court of law. This order was passed on 11.09.1987. The suit was filed in
1988. Therefore, this Court holds that the suit is really not barred by
limitation.
As far as issue Nos.3 and 4 are concerned, there is no clear pleading or
evidence. Therefore, this Court concurs with the finding of the lower Court on
issue Nos.3 and 4 and they need not be specifically decided again by this
Court. Issue No.7 is about the general relief.
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the
plaintiff-club has failed to prove its title and possession to the property.
There is no clarity about the actual identity of the property on the ground.
For all the reasons, this Court holds that there are no merits in the appeal
and accordingly the same is dismissed. The judgment and decree dated

    HONBLE SRI JUSTICE D.V.S.S. SOMAYAJULU         
    AS No.176 of 1995 
    JUDGMENT:   
This appeal is filed by the plaintiff against the judgment and decree dated
21.11.1994 passed by the Sub-ordinate Judge, Nalgonda in OS No.62 of 1988.
For the sake of convenience, as this is a first appeal, the parties are
referred to as in the suit only viz., plaintiff and defendants.
The suit is filed by the Silver Jubilee Club, Deverkonda, which is a society
registered under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Pubic Societies
Registration Act, vide registration No.851 of 1974. It is filed against the
State of Andhra Pradesh, the Mandal Revenue Officer, Deverkonda Mandal and 17
other private parties, claiming a declaration of title and perpetual
injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs
possession and property viz., the land and the house bearing No.12-205, 12-206
and 12-207 situated in Survey Nos.669 and 670 of Deverkonda Village and the
refund of an amount of Rs.6,566.20 paise from the second defendant. These are
the main reliefs claimed. The suit schedule property is described clearly as
follows:
Silver Jubilee Club bearing house Nos.12-205, 12-206 and 12-207 with open
place and compound covering survey Nos.669 and 670  measuring in all Ac.7.07
guntas of dry land situated in Devarkonda Village with the following
boundaries:
East : Sri Kodandarama Swamy Temple, West : Private house, North : Gram
Panchayat Road, South : Jadcherla-Nalgonda PWD Road.
This is the specific property for which the relief of declaration and
injunction is sought for. As far as the monetary claim is concerned, it is the
case of the plaintiff-club that they have sold the standing trees to a third
party and at that stage the Government interfered and claimed that the
property is Government property and therefore the amount was paid to the
of the lower Court on issue No.5 also.
Issue No.3 is whether the suit is barred by limitation. It is clear from a
reading of Ex.A.13 order that the Honble High Court of Andhra Pradesh gave
permission to the plaintiff-club for agitating their rights, if any, before
the court of law. This order was passed on 11.09.1987. The suit was filed in
1988. Therefore, this Court holds that the suit is really not barred by
limitation.
As far as issue Nos.3 and 4 are concerned, there is no clear pleading or
evidence. Therefore, this Court concurs with the finding of the lower Court on
issue Nos.3 and 4 and they need not be specifically decided again by this
Court. Issue No.7 is about the general relief.
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the
plaintiff-club has failed to prove its title and possession to the property.
There is no clarity about the actual identity of the property on the ground.

and accordingly the same is dismissed. The judgment and decree dated
