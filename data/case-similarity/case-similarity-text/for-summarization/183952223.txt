DATED : 9th & 13th September 2019 ORAL JUDGMENT (Per S.C. Dharmadhikari, J):
1\. By these petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
essential challenge of the petitioners is to the induction of Mr Radhakrushna
Vikhe Patil, Mr Jaydatta Kshirsagar and Mr Avinash Mahatekar as Cabinet
Ministers and Minister of State, respectively in the Maharashtra State Cabinet
of Ministers. As the challenge is common, both petitions can be disposed of by
a single Judgment.
2\. We take the facts in in Writ Petition No. 6996 of 2019 fled by Mr Vijay
Namdeorao Wadettiwar. He says that he is a member of the Indian National
Congress Legislature Party. He has been elected  Page 4 of 152 9th & 13th

to the Maharashtra State Legislative Council for a term of six years. He is a
leader of the Lower House of the Maharashtra State Legislature. He had
ofciated as Minister of State twice in the past.
3\. The Respondents Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are inducted in the State Cabinet by the
Respondent No. 2 and were sworn in as Ministers by the Hon'ble Governor of
Maharashtra in terms of the advice tendered to him. These three persons are
not members of the legislature.
4\. As far as Respondent No. 5 is concerned, he was elected as a Member of the
Legislative Assembly from Shirdi constituency in Maharashtra State Legislative
Assembly Election 2014. He contested the elections as a candidate of the
Indian National Congress. He was leader of opposition in the State Legislative
Assembly. The 6th Respondent was elected as an M.L.A. from Beed constituency
in Maharashtra State Legislative Assembly Election 2014 as a candidate of the
Nationalist Congress Party.  Page 5 of 152

5\. Respondent No. 5 resigned from his political party with a declaration that
he intends to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, namely, the ruling party. This
is evident, according to the Petitioner, from a news item published in the
daily newspapers circulated in Mumbai and elsewhere in Maharashtra and that is
not disputed. Thus, Respondent No. 5 has now joined the Bharatiya Janata
Party.
6\. The 6th Respondent is a candidate from Chausala District, Beed. He equally
made up his mind on 22nd May 2019 to sever his relations with the Nationalist
Congress Party and join the Shiv Sena.
7\. These persons thus resigned from their respective erstwhile parties and
joined the ruling alliance. These two Respondents have demitted their seats by
resigning from the Vidhan Sabha / State Legislative Assembly. Thus, the 5th
Respondent is not the leader of opposition in the Assembly nor is he
associated with the Indian National Congress Party. On 16th June 2019, he was
sworn in as a Cabinet Minister.

8\. At page 46 of the paper-book is a letter of one Sanjay Kale. He has
invited the attention of the authorities concerned to Article 164 of the
Constitution of India. He has complained that this induction into the Cabinet
of these two persons in question is nothing but an attempt to get over the
Constitutional mandate and avoid the consequences of the Anti-Defection Law.
It is an attempt to get over the Constitutional embargo on change of political
loyalty by resigning from the party on whose tickets the candidates have been
elected, and this is done just fve months before the end of the term of the
House. Such persons are rewarded by making them Cabinet Ministers although it
is known that they will not be elected within the period specifed in clause
(4) of Article 164 of the Constitution of India. There is no re-election
possible. By virtue of Section 151-A of the Representation of Peoples Act
1951, no bye- elections can be held to fll up any vacancy that might be caused
even if these two persons resign. Today, the situation is that the
disqualifcation proceedings which have been initiated against these two
persons are pending.

9\. The 7th Respondent, Avinash Mahatekar, is not a member of either House but
he is a Member of the Republican Party of India, Athawale Group. He is equally
a benefciary of a berth in the State Cabinet. He will also not be elected
either, for no election is possible to enable him to get elected to the House.
10\. Thus, all three of these Respondents have now been rewarded with
ministerial berths with the House having less than six months term.
11\. Mr Talekar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner in
these petitions, addressed several contentions. We found from the nature of
the arguments canvassed by both sides that there is no dispute on facts and
there is thus no need of fling any returns or Afdavits. Be that as it may, a
return is fled by the 5th Respondent and it is treated as a return or Afdavit
in Reply for both petitions.

12\. Since a short legal question is involved, we grant Rule in these
petitions. The Respondents concerned waive service. Heard both sides at great
length.
13\. By consent of both sides, we dispose of these petitions fnally.
14\. Our attention has been invited by Mr Talekar to Articles 163, 164(1-B)
and Article 164(4) of the Constitution of India. He has also invited our
attention to Articles 173 and 191 and to the Tenth Schedule to the
Constitution. Mr Talekar has submitted that there is an application made to
the Speaker (Respondent No.4) seeking disqualifcation of Respondents Nos. 5
and 6. The applications are fled on 17th June 2019 and prayer clause (c) of Mr
Wadettiwar's petition prays for a time-frame for disposal of these petitions.
15\. On the larger challenge, Mr Talekar would submit that probity in public
administration and ensuring purity in public afairs is the object behind the
insertion of these Constitutional provisions. He read extensively from the
Constituent Assembly debates to buttress his argument that the Constitution
never envisaged the  Page 9 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on -
24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020 00:10:08 ::: Vijay Namdeorao
Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State
of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC induction into the Cabinet or the
Ministry of persons who are not members of either House, and who cannot
continue for more than six months in such ministerial berths and who
simultaneously have no prospect or possibility of a re-election within six
months. The only non-legislator who can be sworn in as a minister is one who
has the actual possibility of getting elected within six months, i.e. when the
remaining term of the House permits such a re-election or election. Mr
Talekar's arguments are premised on this fact that the Constitution postulates
that the a non-legislator Minister is duty- bound to face the electorate
within six months. He cannot continue as a non-legislator minister any longer
than that. There is no possibility at all of Respondents Nos. 5 and 6 facing
an election (let alone being elected) simply because the term of the
Legislative Assembly is less than six months from the date of their induction.
Pertinently, both these persons have voluntarily resigned from the membership
of the original party and of the House as well. Yet they are inducted in the
cabinet and given ministerial berths, purely for political expediency. This is
all the more egregious when the son of Respondent No. 5 on the eve of Lok
Sabha elections joined the  Page 10 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 :::
Uploaded on - 24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020 00:10:08 ::: Vijay
Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors
v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC Bharatiya Janata Party.
Respondent No. 5 ensured a Lok Sabha nomination by the BJP for his son from
the Kopargaon constituency. The son was duly elected. It was, therefore, clear
that the Respondent No. 5 desired to defect to the Bharatiya Janata Party.
16\. Mr Talekar, therefore, submits that we should not place an interpretation
on clause (4) of Article 164 which will reduce it to 'a dead letter'. That
Article itself should not be read in isolation but must be read along with
Articles 173 and 191(2) and the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. If
elections were not possible for these persons, and that fact was known to the
Chief Minister, then such a person could not have been inducted into his
Cabinet. Doing so makes not only a mockery of the Constitutional principles
and democracy as a whole, but what is directly prohibited is sought to be
achieved in an indirect and oblique manner.
17\. Apart from extensive oral arguments, Mr Talekar has also handed in a note
of his written submissions and several volumes of compilations of additional
materials.

Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors
10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC
18\. In that note, we have found that Mr Talekar has made a reference to these
Articles and elaborated that the power to induct a non-legislator into a
ministerial berth is not an unfettered one. That power has to be exercised on
an assurance and understanding that any such non-legislator will get himself
or herself elected within six months; he or she cannot continue for any longer
period. If a bye- election in the present case within six months was always
impossible or impermissible, then exceptional circumstances ought to have
existed for such an induction. They should have been demonstrated. There has
to be seen to exist an emergent or extraordinary situation for the induction
of a non-legislator as a minister and it must be proved that he was inducted
to obtain his expert guidance and advice. Therefore, political persons apart,
others who are experts in their respective feld can be inducted, for, with
their experience and expertise, the afairs of the Government and
administration can be improved. However, such contingencies and circumstances
have to be established. Political expediency or political convenience can
never be a substitute nor can it be ever termed as an exceptional circumstance
or an extraordinary contingency.  Page 12 of 152

19\. The other argument is that merely because an application is made to
disqualify these two persons, a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot be thrown out or held to be not maintainable.
This Court is requested to grant a declaration so that the constitutional
mechanism is sub-served and moves ahead. That constitutional mandate should
not be frustrated and defeated by such a subterfuge, according to Mr Talekar.
Therefore, he would submit that the remedy to seek disqualifcation should not
infuence the outcome of these petitions. In substance, the power of judicial
review can be exercised to scrutinise the instant induction. The petitions
raise important questions of interpretation of the Constitution and are
therefore maintainable. This Court is not called upon to decide any political
issues or questions.
20\. Mr Talekar would submit that while interpreting Constitutional
provisions, the purpose behind them, and particularly those meant not to
encourage but to thwart defection, must be noted by us. If a person is
disqualifed to be a minister from inception, then that person cannot be
brought into the Cabinet by an  Page 13 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 :::

Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors
v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC oblique or indirect method.
Such a disqualifed candidate could not have been made a minister in the frst
place, and that such a disqualifcation by itself would exclude him therefore
is clear. Once that is clear, then a person other than such a candidate can be
brought in for a limited period and within that limited period, he must face
the electorate. The heart of democracy is free and fair elections. Adult
sufrage is the rule and not the exception. We must therefore place a purposive
interpretation on these Constitutional provisions and read them harmoniously.
That democratic spirit, representative participation, duties of Constitutional
functionaries, Constitutional morality, values, and trust are, therefore, to
be borne in mind in dealing with such a controversy.
21\. Mr Talekar has handed over to us a copy of the notifcation which notifes
the Members of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (Disqualifcation on Ground of
Defection) Rules 1986. Mr Talekar has also tendered to us the Constituent
Assembly Debates, Volume VIII and extracts thereof of 1st June 1949 on Article

1985 and the Constitution (Ninety-First Amendment) Act 2003. Thereafter, heavy
reliance is placed upon two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in
the case of S.R. Chaudhuri v State of Punjab and Others1 and VR Kapoor v State
of Tamil Nadu.2 It is submitted that Article 164(4) is neither a source of
power nor an enabling provision for the appointment of a non-legislator as a
minister even for a short duration. Secondly, a non-member to be appointed as
a minister must possess the qualifcations under Article 173, and must not have
sufered a disqualifcation under Article 191. The Governor must reject any
proposal to appoint such an unqualifed or disqualifed person as minister. Else
a writ of quo warranto can be issued.

judicial review. Our attention is also invited to certain judgments which set
out salutary principles on Constitutional interpretation.

23\. Thus, the emphasis is on giving a meaningful interpretation to the
provisions of the Constitution that are pressed into service. The whole
purpose is to emphasize that the Constitution is a living document and must
take care of, and must reach, every attempt evolved over time by those in the
political feld and in power to defeat and frustrate its objectives. We are,
therefore, called upon to place such an interpretation on the Constitution
which would advance its intent and suppress the mischief.
24\. During the course of his arguments, Mr Talekar has also invited our
attention to a judgment of a Division Bench of this Court rendered at Nagpur.
That judgment has been rendered in the case of Sandeep Yashwantrao Sarode v
Election Commission of India.3
25\. On the other hand, Mr V.A. Thorat, learned Senior Advocate who has been
appointed as a Special Counsel by the State, would submit that this writ
petition should be dismissed. He would submit that in the garb of placing an
interpretation on certain Articles of the Constitution, we cannot re-write the
Constitution itself. That which 3 2019 SCC On-Line Bombay 629.

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC is not expressly provided in the Constitution cannot be
introduced or imputed by an interpretative process. Mr Thorat would submit
that if the Constitution enacts something as an express bar or a prohibition,
then and then alone is there an opportunity to consider the arguments
canvassed by Mr Talekar. Mr Thorat would submit that the very foundation of
the edifce of Mr Talekar's argument is fawed simply because there is no
express prohibition in appointing or inducting a non-legislator as a minister
merely because the term of the House is coming to an end in less than six
months. That the term of the House is less then six months and hence the
induction is bad is not a possible argument in this case. This Court is called
upon to read a Constitutional Article in a manner convenient to the
petitioners, one of whom is also an active politician. What the petitioner
seeks to do is to introduce an otherwise non-existent link or nexus in the
Constitution between the outer limit within which the non-legislator must get
elected and the term (or remainder of the term) of the House. If such a link
or nexus was the Constitutional intent and purpose, a specifc provision would
have been made in the Constitution itself. Absent such a provision, we  Page

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC cannot read anything like it into the Constitution. Thus,
it is not permissible to take away or add something to the Constitution.
26\. There is another error in the understanding of the Constitutional
provision, namely that it has not been inserted only to take care of political
manoeuvring or the engineering of defections. The provision to induct a non-
legislator enables a person who is not a member of either House to be brought
in the cabinet so that his expertise or experience can be utilized for
improving the administration and the afairs of the State. It is entirely left
to the discretion of the Chief Minister therefore to induct such a non-
legislator and when that advice is tendered, the Governor has only to ensure
that the constitutional mandate enshrined in clause (4) of Article 164 would
be adhered to later on. If such a person cannot get elected after six months,
he would cease to be a Minister. That is provided in the Constitution itself.
In other words, the non- legislator-Minister must get elected to the House
within six months, else the Chief Minister must drop him. None has a choice.
In the circumstances, the induction of Respondents Nos. 5 and 6 does not  Page

nature as would warrant interference with their induction in our limited
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Mr Thorat,
therefore, would submit that the writ petition be dismissed.
27\. For properly appreciating the rival contentions, a reference to the
Constitution would be necessary. The Constitution of India contains specifc
Articles inserted in Part VI Chapter 2, titled as "The Executive" with the
sub-title "The Governor". Articles 153 to 158 deal with the Governor and in
Article 159 "Oath or afrmation by the Governor" is provided for. The
"Discharge of the functions of the Governor in certain contingencies" is a
matter dealt with by Article 160 and Article 161 enacts the power of Governor
to grant pardons etc. and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain
cases. The extent of the executive power of the State is set out by Article
162 and then another sub-title "Council of Ministers" contains Articles 163
and 164. The said Articles read as under:

28\. A perusal of Article 163 shows that by clause (1) it mandates that there
shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and
advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he
is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of
them in his discretion. Clause (2) of Article 163 says that if any question
arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor
is by or under this Constitution required to act in his discretion, the
decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be fnal. The validity of
anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground
that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion. Clause (3) of
Article 163 says that question whether any, and if so what, advice was
tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be inquired into in any Court.
The marginal heading of Article 164 head is "Other provisions as to
Ministers". By clause (1), the Chief Minister shall be appointed by the
Governor and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the Governor on the
advice of the Chief  Page 22 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on

Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State
of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC Minister, and the Ministers shall
hold ofce during the pleasure of the Governor. There is a proviso to clause
(1) of Article 164, which requires the States of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand ,
Madhya Pradesh and Odisha to have a Minister in charge of tribal welfare who
may in addition be in charge of the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and
backward classes or any other work. By clause (1-A), there is an outer limit
on the number of Ministers including the Chief Minister in the Council of
Ministers in a State and that shall not exceed ffteen per cent of the total
number of Members of the Legislative Assembly of that State.
29\. This clause has been inserted by the Constitution (Ninety- frst
Amendment) Act, 2003 with efect from 1st January 2004. Clause (1-B) says that
a Member of the Legislative Assembly of a State or either House of the
Legislature of the State having a Legislative Council, and belonging to any
political party, who is disqualifed for being a Member of that House under
paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualifed to be appointed as
a Minister under clause (1) for duration of the period commencing  Page 23 of
152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on - 24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on -

Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors
10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC from the date of his disqualifcation till the date on
which the term of his ofce as such member would expire.
30\. There is a further stipulation. Clause (2) of Article 164 says that the
Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative
Assembly of the State and by clause (3) before a Minister enters upon his
ofce, the Governor shall administer to him the oath of ofce and of secrecy
according to the forms set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule.
31\. Then comes clause (4). This says that a Minister who for any period of
six consecutive months is not a member of the Legislature of the State shall
at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister. Advisedly the clause
says a 'Minister'. That means a person can be sworn in as a Minister even if
he is not a Member of the Legislature of the State, but if for any period of
six consecutive months, he is not a Member of the Legislature of the State,
then he shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister.  Page

32\. There is no dispute about the understanding of this clause and that is
that a person who is a non-legislator but made a Minister has to be elected
before the expiration of the period specifed in clause (4). Else he ceases to
be a Minister.
33\. Admittedly this is not the situation or position obtaining before us on
facts.
34\. The position obtaining on facts is that the persons who are now inducted
as Ministers, Respondents Nos. 5 and 6, were erstwhile Members of the House
and were also Members at one time of political parties who sponsored their
candidature from distinct constituencies. They severed their connection or
relations with these political parties, tendered their resignation from the
House and joined the ruling alliance. Whether they have defected or not is not
the question before us. That would be addressed distinctly by the competent
authority in diferent and separate proceedings. We are only concerned about
the induction of such persons as are referred by us above in the Council of
Ministers by the Chief Minister.

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC
35\. The argument is that the Chief Minister and the Governor both knew, since
the Governor acted on the advice of the Chief Minister, that Respondents Nos.
5 and 6 can never be elected as Members of the Legislature of the State before
the expiration of the period mentioned in clause (4) of Article 164 because
the duration or term of the House itself is coming to an end. That term will
end even before the outer limit of six months stipulated in this clause.
Therefore, knowingly such non-legislators were inducted as Ministers in the
Council, particularly on the eve of elections for purely political reasons and
convenience. Their induction, therefore, is contrary to the mandate of this
clause. Once their election is an impossibility then all the more the
induction cannot be supported. This is the frame of Mr Talekar's case.
36\. In this regard, Mr Talekar also invites our attention to other Articles
of the Constitution, viz., Articles 172, 173 and 191(2) which set out the
duration of State Legislature. Article 172 says in clause (1) that every
Legislative Assembly of every State, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue
for fve years from the date appointed for  Page 26 of 152 9th & 13th September

Vijay Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora
& Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC its frst meeting and
no longer and the expiration of the said period of fve years shall operate as
a dissolution of the Assembly. Clause (2) of Article 172 says that the
Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as
nearly as possible one-third of the Members thereof shall retire as soon as
may be on the expiration of every second year in accordance with the
provisions made in that behalf by the Parliament by law.
37\. Then Article 173 sets out the qualifcation for Membership of the State
Legislature. A person shall not be qualifed to be chosen to fll a seat in the
Legislature of a State unless he is a citizen of India, by clause (a) of
Article 173, in the case of seat in Legislative Assembly shall not less than
twenty-fve years of age and in the case of a seat in the Legislative Council
shall not be less than thirty years of age and possesses such other
qualifcations as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by
the Parliament.
38\. Article 191 follows a series of Articles, particularly Article 190 under
the sub-title 'Disqualifcation of Members' and says in specifc terms that a
person shall be disqualifed for being a Member of the  Page 27 of 152 9th &

Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors
10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State if
he is so disqualifed under the Tenth Schedule.
39\. Of course, he will be disqualifed if he incurs the disqualifcation under
clause (1) of Article 191 and he cannot be chosen as, or for being, a Member
of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State on his inviting
these disqualifcations.
40\. We must at once deal with the contention of Mr Talekar that Respondents
Nos. 5 and 6 are disqualifed on account of their defections. This is not the
law, for a person stands disqualifed only on being so adjudged. No such
adjudication has taken place in the case of Respondents Nos. 5 and 6, for the
applications seeking their disqualifcation are admittedly pending. One cannot
presume that they are disqualifed merely because there is an allegation of
disqualifcation made against them. That allegation will have to be inquired
into by a process known to law. The disqualifcation is not automatic in this
case and it will have to be adjudicated upon by the process set out in Tenth
Schedule of the Constitution. We cannot, therefore, agree with Mr Talekar that
the Respondents Nos. 5 and 6  Page 28 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 :::
Uploaded on - 24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020 00:10:08 ::: Vijay
Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors
v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC stand disqualifed. The
allegation or case that they have incurred or invited this disqualifcation by
their acts of omission or commission or conduct must be ruled upon under
specifc provisions. Persons like Respondents Nos. 5 and 6 cannot be held to be
disqualifed for being inducted in the Ministry as suggested by Mr Talekar,
viz., that because they resigned from one party to join another and they
allegedly tried to get over a defection by resigning from the House. This in
itself will not allow us to hold that they stand disqualifed for being
inducted as Ministers. At best, they have joined another alliance which is in
power. That alliance thought of inducting them in the Ministry, maybe for
political reasons, but that by itself will not enable us to hold that
disqualifed Members or disqualifed persons are inducted. 'Disqualifcation'
means something that disqualifes and 'to disqualify' means to make or
pronounce ineligible or unsuitable, to incapacitate legally. This
pronouncement or declaration is awaited. The proceedings in that behalf are
pending and the Hon'ble Speaker is yet to rendering his ruling on that
question.

41\. The argument of Shri Talekar overlooks the scheme of the Tenth Schedule
to the Constitution. However, we cannot ignore the same and take over the
powers of the Hon'ble Speaker of the House to decide the application seeking
disqualifcation of respondent Nos. 5 and 6.
42\. After disposing of the frst contention of Mr Talekar, we equally do not
agree with him for he demands that we should set out a time schedule for the
Speaker to deal with the applications or prescribe a time-frame. In that
regard, a perusal of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution would reveal that
the disqualifcation proceedings have to take a specifc route. The
disqualifcation proceedings envisaged by this Schedule would demonstrate that
frstly the disqualifcation on the ground of defection set out in paragraph 2,
which is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5, has been shown to be
incurred or attracted. Paragraphs 4 and 5 clarify that disqualifcation on
ground of defection will not apply in case of merger. Then, there is an
exemption carved out by paragraph (5).

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC
43\. What we have for our consideration and importantly is paragraph 6, which
says in clearest terms in sub-paragraph (1) that when any question arises as
to whether a Member of a House has become subject to disqualifcation under
this Schedule, the question shall be referred for the decision of the Chairman
or, as the case may be, the Speaker of such House and his decision shall be
fnal. Then sub-paragraph (2) says that all proceedings under sub-paragraph (1)
of this paragraph in relation to any question as to disqualifcation of a
Member of the House under this Schedule shall be deemed to be proceedings in
Parliament within the meaning of Article 122 or, as the case may be,
proceedings in the Legislature of a State within the meaning of Article 212.
Then by paragraph 8 there is a rule making power conferred. That is subjected
to sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 8. However, importantly for us, we must
refer to clause (1) of sub-paragraph 1 of Rule 8 which says that the Rules
contemplated by that paragraph may provide for the procedure for deciding any
question referred to in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 6 including procedure
for any inquiry which may be made for the purpose of deciding such question.

44\. The Authority that is chosen for the purposes of a decision on the
applications made in this case is the Speaker of the House. The specifc rules
which would enable the Speaker to deal with such a question are in place. We
have not been shown any time-frame either in the Tenth Schedule or in the
Members of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (Disqualifcation on ground of
Defection) Rules 1986 which would mandate the disposal of the applications
within a given time-frame. The disqualifcation proceedings have to follow
Rules 6 and 7 and the procedure set out therein before a decision either way
can be taken.
45\. The language of Rule 8 of these Rules is important for our purpose. It
says that at the conclusion of the consideration of the petition, the Speaker
shall by an order in writing dismiss the petition or declare that the Member
in relation to whom the petition has been made has become subject to
disqualifcation under the Tenth Schedule and cause copies of the order to be
delivered or forwarded to the Petitioner, the Member in relation to whom the
petition has been made and the leader of the Legislature Party, if any
concerned.  Page 32 of 152

to disqualifcation under the Tenth Schedule shall be reported to the Assembly
forthwith if the Assembly is in session and if the Assembly is not in session
immediately after the Assembly re- assembles. The procedure that is to be
followed and as laid down in Rule 7 is fairly elaborate. Advisedly, therefore,
there is no outer limit prescribed. The decision has to be taken by the
Speaker of the House. We cannot by a judicial fat set out a time frame for the
Hon'ble Speaker to render his decision when neither the substantive provisions
in the Tenth Schedule nor the Rules set out the same. To our mind, therefore,
these questions are best left to the wisdom and experience of the Speaker. We
assume that the Speaker would give the proceedings the required priority and
would not allow their purpose to be defeated and frustrated.

Constitution of India, and particularly clause (4) thereof. Before we render
our opinion on this question, we would  Page 33 of 152 9th & 13th September

to certain judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the point of
interpretation of the Constitution. Resumed on 13th September 2019:
47\. As early as in 1994, in R.C. Poudyal v Union of India and Others,4 a
decision by a bench of fve judges, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion
to express its opinion on the preamble to the Constitution of India. The
Hon'ble Court elucidated some of the expressions employed therein, and

51\. Therefore, Mr Talekar presses into service the principles of
interpretation of Constitution and particularly that it is a living organ and
that its ongoing interpretation is permissible. Mr Talekar has also invited
our attention to several judgments, and particularly the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered recently on the powers of a Lieutenant
Governor.7 The Governor of National Capital Territory of Delhi who is styled
as a Lieutenant Governor had a confict with the elected Government, and while
resolving that confict, the issues that cropped up for consideration before
the Supreme Court were noted and considered. While we appreciate the 7 State
(NCT at Delhi) vs Union of India and Ors, (2018) 8 SCC 501.  Page 46 of 152

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC anxiety of Mr Talekar, what we can do by an
interpretative process has certain in-built and inherent limitations.
52\. Mr Talekar's arguments are premised on his reading of Article 164(4) as
covering even a situation of the present nature. He would submit that if it is
impossible for the Election Commission to hold a bye-election or a re-election
and that is because the term of the Assembly itself is going to expire, then
that impossibility of holding an election, re-election or bye-election should
not mean that a handle is provided to induct in the ministry the non-
legislators.
53\. We do not think that the Constitution can be read as suggested by Mr
Talekar.
54\. There are numerous instances where the Supreme Court has considered
several provisions of the Constitution. One may illustratively refer to two
recent judgments. In one judgment. the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering
the challenge to Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code 1860. While
holding them as constitutional, legal and valid, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
took  Page 47 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on - 24/09/2019
::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020 00:10:08 ::: Vijay Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State
Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors
10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC note of established principles of interpretation,
particularly on the interpretation of statutes, and held these to govern
questions of interpretation of the Constitution itself. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court adverted to its previous decisions and concluded that the Constitution
of India has to be interpreted so as to give meaning to every expression and
word used therein. There is, therefore, no scope for whittling down or
diluting the Constitution in any manner.8
55\. At the same time, in another decision in Manoj Narula v Union of India,9
the Supreme Court considered the limitations which are exceptions to this
principle. In that decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court concluded that in the
garb of interpreting the Constitution itself, we cannot assume that there is a
defect or lacunae therein or that we can remove it by an interpretative
process. The Court cautioned that nothing should be read in the Constitution
that is expressly not there. There is no question of adding or subtracting
anything as far as the Constitution is 8 Subramanian Swamy v Union of India &
Ors, (2016) 7 SCC 221.

Vijay Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora
& Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC concerned. The caution
administered in the later judgment is, to our mind, enough guidance. The
judgment of the Hon'ble Mr Justice Madan B. Lokur, as His Lordship then was,
shows us the path in holding that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in
the manner suggested in that case as well as in the present case. We cannot
re- write a Constitutional provision. In the garb of its interpretation it
will not be possible to assume that there is something lacking or missing in
the Constitution itself.
56\. What the decision in the case of Manoj Narula v Union of India says,
speaking through a fve judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, is eloquent
enough. The issue there was somewhat comparable. In that case, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had before it a writ petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution fled by the petitioner, Manoj Narula pro bono publico assailing
the appointment of some of the original respondents to that petition as
ministers in the Council of Ministers of Union of India despite their
involvement in serious and heinous crimes. On 24th March 2006, this matter was
listed before a bench presided over by the then learned Chief Justice  Page 49

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC and he passed an order referring it to a Constitution
Bench. The controversy required the Supreme Court to interpret the scope and
purpose of Articles 75 and 164 of the Constitution regard being had to the
text, context, scheme and spirit of the Constitution.
57\. While lamenting the fact that there is a gross criminalisation of
politics and that is an anathema to the sacredness of democracy, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court laid down a principle of interpretation of Constitution, one we
fnd to be vital and salutary. The Hon'ble Supreme Court outlined the concept
that because a constitutional provision does not encompass every possible
situation including of the nature brought before us does not mean its silence
is not telling or it is not speaking at all. A constitutional silence is also
important and equally salutary. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that what is
not constitutionally prohibited cannot be held to be permitted and that is not
how the Constitution must be read and interpreted. That the Prime Minister and
Chief Ministers cannot be constitutionally prohibited to give advice to the
President and the Governor in respect of a person becoming a Minister who is
charged for serious  Page 50 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on

Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State
of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC or heinous ofences or ofences
relating to corruption, would not mean that by interpretative process we will
read such a prohibition into Article 75(1) or 161(4)(i). These will have to be
then taken as fetters on the powers of the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers
to include in their Ministry persons of their choice. That would tantamount to
prescribing an eligibility qualifcation and adding a disqualifcation which has
not been stipulated in the Constitution. There is a basic rule of
interpretation of Constitution and that is that one takes into consideration
the intent of the framers. There is a doctrine of implied limitation. That
Constituent Assembly or Parliamentary Debates are but aids to interpreting the
Constitution. However, we cannot substitute, amend and rewrite a
Constitutional provision with the aid of these debates. The debates are
enlightening enough as we have noted in this case. In the debates themselves,
there is an indicator as to why the Members of the Constituent Assembly did
not frame or model Article 164(4) in the manner suggested before us by Mr
Talekar. That they left the matter at that or by not encompassing a situation
like the one brought before us does not mean that there is an approval or
permission to resort to  Page 51 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded

Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State
of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC what is complained of in this case.
The Supreme Court has said and in clearest terms that whenever the
Constitution is silent in matters of the nature covered by Articles 75 and
164, there is a Constitutional trust reposed in holders of high ofce. In a
written Constitution like ours, the Prime Minister as also the Chief Ministers
are expected to act with Constitutional responsibility as a consequence of
which the cherished values of democracy and established norms of good
governance get condignly fructifed. The framers of the Constitution left many
a thing unwritten by reposing immense trust in the Prime Minister. The scheme
of the Constitution suggests that there has to be an emergence of
Constitutional governance which would gradually grow to give rise to a
Constitutional renaissance.
58\. Thus, the silence has been taken to be a doctrine by itself. The
principle of constitutional silence or abeyance is progressive and is applied
as a recognized advanced constitutional practice to fll up gaps in respect of
certain areas in the interest of justice and larger public interest. The
applicability of such a doctrine of silence when  Page 52 of 152 9th & 13th
September 2019 ::: Uploaded on - 24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020
00:10:08 ::: Vijay Namdeorao Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors |
Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC
there is already an existing express provision, particularly in relation to
disqualifcations, therefore, has an in-built limitation and would enable the
Court to leave the silence at that and not attempt to re- write or introduce
into the Constitution something which is expressly not there.
59\. We also note from the Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol VIII, 1st June
1949, that the precise issue came up for discussion. The Article in the draft
being discussed corresponding to present Article 164(4) was Article 144(3). It
read, in its original form, exactly as the current Article 164(4) reads today,
viz., thus:
> A.144(3) A Minister who for any period of six consecutive months is not a
> member of the Legislature of the State shall at the expiration of that
> period cease to be a Minister.
Shri Mohd Tahir moved the following amendment, as Amendment No.185:

> We fnd from a close reading of the transcript that Amendment No. 185 was
> negatived.
60\. It follows therefore, that in addition to the doctrine of silence, what
will apply here is another principle: once a provision has been negatived and
specifcally omitted, it can be re-introduced or imputed back into the very
provision from which it was excluded by a process of interpretation of 'intent
and purpose'. The only manner in which it can be re-introduced is by a
positive act of legislature, i.e. by a full-fedged amendment. Therefore, what
Mr Talekar urges us to do is not merely absent from the Constitution. An
amendment very similar to what Mr. Talekar proposes today was actually
canvassed and entirely negatived just a little over seven decades ago on 1st
June 1949. We do not see how we can possibly re-introduce by a process of
interpretation the very thing that the Constituent Assembly so considered and
negatived.

61\. We think that the portions of the judgments that we reproduce hereinbelow
are a complete answer to the submissions of Mr Talekar.
62\. Before their reproduction, we must clarify that reluctance to agree with
Mr Talekar should not be construed as a sign of weakness much less a approval
of the induction of Respondent Nos. 5 and 6. We are of the frm opinion that
the doctrine of public trust applies even when the Chief Minister exercises
his powers to make or expand his Council of Ministers. The Chief Minister is
the head of the Council and he ought to be aware of his duty to abide by the
trust reposed in him by the Constitution, the supreme instrument. A political
compulsion or convenience should not result in a compromise with the
Constitutional values and ideals of Democracy. A true and real leader of the
State, which the Chief Minister is, and not just of the ruling party, is
vested with a power which is coupled with a duty. While making the Cabinet, he
is expected to act with maturity and responsibility and do nothing to destroy
the trust reposed in him by the Constitution. Very often, the  Page 55 of 152

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC Chief Minister is compelled to accept as his colleagues,
persons of doubtful integrity and character only because they have been
elected at the general elections from a area or region where the ruling party
has strong roots and a base or a sizeable presence. Popular leaders are
foisted on the Chief Minister and consequently imposed on the State. It is
here that the Chief Minister is tested and if he possesses qualities of
statesmanship, he can successfully get over the above- noted situations. All
political parties, whether in power today or in opposition should remember the
following words of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shailesh Manubhai Parmar v
Election Commission of India:10 "19. The aforesaid passages throw immense
light on the distinction between direct and indirect elections and especially
on the concept of indirect election which encompasses proportional
representation. There is voting by open ballot and it has been so introduced
to sustain the foundational values of party discipline and to avoid any kind
of cross voting thereby ensuring purity in the election process. They have
been treated as 10 (2018) 9 SCC 100.

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC core values of democracy and fair election. It is worth
to note that in a voting for members of the Council of States, the nature of
voting by an elector is a grave concern. It is because in such an election,
there is a party whip and the elector is bound to obey the command of the
party. The party discipline in this kind of election is of extreme
signifcance, for that is the fulcrum of the existence of political parties. It
is essential in a parliamentary democracy. The thought of cross voting and
corruption is obnoxious in such a voting. In this context, we may refer with
proft to the authority in Ravi S. Naik v. Union of India (1994 Supp (2) SCC
641). In the said case, the question arose relating to the disqualifcation of
a Member of the State Legislature under Article 191(2) read with the Tenth
Schedule to the Constitution. The two-Judge Bench referred to the decision in
Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu (1992 Supp (2) SCC 651) and addressed the issue
of defection covered under paragraphs 2(1)
(a) and 2(1)(b) of the Tenth Schedule. Referring to the said paragraphs, the
Court ruled: (Ravi S Naik Case, SCC p.649, para 11)  Page 57 of 152 9th & 13th
September 2019 ::: Uploaded on - 24/09/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 19/04/2020

Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC
"11. ... The said paragraph provides for disqualifcation of a member of a
House belonging to a political party "if he has voluntarily given up his
membership of such political party". The words "voluntarily given up his
membership" are not synonymous with "resignation" and have a wider
connotation. A person may voluntarily give up his membership of a political
party even though he has not tendered his resignation from the membership of
that party. Even in the absence of a formal resignation from membership an
inference can be drawn from the conduct of a member that he has voluntarily
given up his membership of the political party to which he belongs."
23\. In a democracy, the purity of election is categorically imperative. The
democratic body polity, as has been held in Manoj Narula v. Union of India
((2014) 9 SCC 1), stipulates that the quintessential idea of democracy is
abhorrent to corruption and laws emphasize on prevalence of genuine
orderliness, positive propriety, dedicated discipline and sanguine sanctity by
constant afrmance of constitutional morality which is the pillar stone of good
governance. The purity of democracy does not withstand anything that has the
potential to create an  Page 58 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded

of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC incurable chasm in the backbone of a
democratic setup. The law is meant to eradicate the same. ... ... It is a well
settled principle that what cannot be done directly, cannot be done
indirectly. To elaborate, if NOTA is allowed in the election of the members to
the Council of States, the prohibited aspect of defection would indirectly
usher in with immense vigour.
24\. We may further add with proft that the purpose of introduction of NOTA in
PUCL case is that a provision for negative voting can send a clear message to
the political parties and what a voter thinks about the candidates in the
fray. Thus, the said decision is directly relatable to a direct election, one
man, one vote and one value."
63\. Pertinently, Manoj Narula (supra) is followed and, hence, we quote the
paragraphs from the same:

65\. In taking this approach, we do not for a moment suggest that we construe
the Constitution as promoting and encouraging defections. We fnd Mr. Talekar's
submission in this regard to be unfortunate, viz., that should we not accept
his construct and interpretation, it would tantamount to our holding that the
Constitution promotes and encourages defections. We are not saying anything of
this kind. What we are questioning is the fundamental premise underlying Mr.
Talekar's case and, particularly, his understanding of the word 'defections'.
When we say 'defections', we are careful not to express any opinion on the
facts and circumstances of the present case. However, it is  Page 136 of 152

67\. Merely because our courts, including the highest Court in the country,
have not allowed the Constitution to be interpreted in a manner suggested by
parties like the Petitioners before us to take care of every evil does not
mean that the Constitution promotes,  Page 138 of 152 9th & 13th September

& Ors v State of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC allows or permits,
much less approves, such evil. If it is an evil, it must be looked at as such.
If for pure political gains people are crossing over, then it is the bounden
duty of the voters to take care of such a situation and teach these leaders or
defectors a lesson. Ultimately, in every democracy real power rests with the
people. Merely because one is in majority does not mean there is a license to
strangulate the minority. In democracy there is an equal place, respect and
regard for an opposition. It guides the majority in carrying out the
administrative and governmental afairs properly and smoothly. It is that
aspect of the matter inbuilt in the observations, fndings and conclusions of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manoj Narula's case which we have reproduced
above.
68\. We do not think that anything more has to be said for our judgment and
order expresses our disinclination to read into the Constitution what is
absent therein but which the Petitioners would have us read into it. Our order
is, therefore, an attempt at striking a balance and must be seen as such. A
balance has to be struck and everything cannot be taken over by Courts. The
Courts can bring to  Page 139 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on

as essentially of an adjudicator of disputes, we cannot take over every
function including the responsibilities of a voter. It is for a voter to

enlightened enough to take note of the recent happenings and events. That it
is not enhancing the image, prestige and reputation of our State but bringing
disrepute to it is therefore a matter which should be noted by the voters and
we leave it to the wisdom and knowledge of the voters and residents of the
State.
69\. We do not think that in the Constitutional scheme noted above, we must
read into clause (4) of Article 164 what is expressly not there. We are not
introducing a disqualifcation therein nor are we re-writing that provision. It
has a certain intent and purpose and why it is not worded as desired by the
petitioners in this petition is therefore clear from the principles to which
we have made a detailed reference. That on the eve of elections none except,

to assist the government in power particularly the Chief Minister to tide over
certain emergent crisis, particularly a fnancial and economic one, is
therefore the expectation of the framers of the Constitution. In the last six
months preceding the expiry of the term of the house the leader, namely, the
Chief Minister, would not induct anybody for pure political gains or for
political convenience is thus the underlying hope. In situations where the
country is facing an economic and fnancial crisis, or a vital issue of its
defence, these would then enable the Prime Minister to induct into the Cabinet
experts in such felds and obtain their advice, guidance and assistance. It is
that advice and assistance which would guide the afairs of the Government and
the Prime Minister would ordinarily want such a person in the cabinet and not
necessarily a politician. He may be a politician but not a member of the
House. Nonetheless he/she could be an expert in economics, fnance, law and
justice, corporate afairs or a defence tactician. Merely because he is not a
member of the ruling combine or any political party should not therefore be a
impediment in his or her induction. That is how the  Page 141 of 152 9th &

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC Constitution must be read and interpreted. None expects
this provision to be used to achieve an ouster or a complete take over of the
opposition in the Legislative Assembly or the Parliament. None would expect
this as a trade or a bargain for retaining power or obtaining political gains.
None would ever expect this to be resorted to for political convenience or to
make inroads into or split opposition parties as well. In such circumstances,
we are not endorsing what has been done in the State but we are expressing our
concern and anxiety in the words and expressions of the Supreme Court itself.
70\. We fnd that the Petitioners are placing their case only on the
disqualifcation of respondents Nos. 5 and 6. That they and the other
respondent who is not a member of the either House and can never be elected
because the six months period is not available for holding a election is the
other complaint. We fnd that these respondents may have been inducted in the
ministry on the eve of the elections or on the eve of the expiry of the term
of the House purely because of political reasons or to enable them to cross

and without anything more would not enable us to hold that these persons were
'disqualifed'. We cannot term them as 'defectors' in terms of the Tenth
Schedule of the Constitution of India. That contains elaborate and exhaustive
provisions to deal with defections. Whether the act of respondents Nos. 5 and
6 amounts to defection is not our concern presently. There are distinct
proceedings pending in that regard. Those proceedings would be taken up and
decided on their own merits and in accordance with law. However, we cannot
presume that the acts of the respondents Nos. 5 and 6 amount to defection and
therefore they could not have been inducted in the ministry. That they
resigned from the House as also a political party on whose ticket they have
been elected may invite other consequences, including a declaration in terms
of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and its paragraphs, but because the
Petitioners have sought their disqualifcation, we cannot assume that their
induction in the ministry was impermissible. That is now not how we have or
rather we can read the Constitution and clause (4) of Article 164. We  Page

71\. As a result of the above discussion we do not think that there is any
merit in the submissions of Mr Talekar. The reliance by Mr Talekar is
essentially on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case arising
from the State of Punjab (S.R. Chaudhuri v State of Punjab & Ors.11) which
would now be required to be noted.
72\. In the Punjab decision the situation was peculiar. The petitioner, SR
Chaudhari approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India complaining that
respondent No. 2, Tej Parkash Singh, was appointed as a minister in the State
of Punjab on the advice of the Chief Minister, Sardar Harcharan Singh Brar, on
9th September 1995\. At the time of his appointment as a Minister he was not a
Member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly. He failed to get himself elected as
a member of the Legislature of the State of Punjab within a period of six
months and submitted his resignation from the Council of Ministers on 8th
March 1996. The term of the 11 (2001) 7 SCC 126.

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC House had not expired and there was a change in the
leadership of the ruling party. The 3rd respondent on her election as a Chief
Minister (after being chosen as the leader of the ruling party) still inducted
the said Tej Parkash Singh. He had not been elected as a member of the
Legislature even when Smt. Rajinder Kaur Bhattal took over as the Chief
Minister on 21st November 1996. However, Tej Parkash was appointed Minister
with efect from 23rd November 1996 and the appellant, SR Chaudhari fled a
petition seeking Writ of Quo Warranto against 2nd Respondent, Tej Parkash
Singh. It was stated in the petition that appointment of the 2nd Respondent
for a second time during the term of the same Legislature, without being
elected as a member of the Legislature was violative of the constitutional
provisions and therefore bad. This Writ Petition was dismissed in limine. The
matter was therefore taken to the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
73\. Mr Talekar's arguments overlook this peculiar factual position.

74\. It was in the peculiar facts and circumstances of that case and fnding
that this would be a total subversion of the rule of law and would make
mockery of the constitutional provision that the Hon'ble Supreme Court stepped
in and held that a person who could not, within the term of the house, get
himself elected within six months of his initial induction cannot overtake the
constitutional mandate. By ceasing to be a minister on expiry of six months
his re- election cannot be facilitated in this manner so as to give him an
extended term in the Ministry, whatever may be the compelling reasons for his
induction. The observations heavily relied upon by Mr Talekar would have to be
considered in the backdrop of the factual controversy before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was not dealing with a controversy or
the issue projected before us. All observations would have to be seen and
noted in the factual backdrop. They are very apt but by relying on them we
cannot arrive at the conclusion desired by the petitioners before us. In
paragraph 33 of this judgment it is held that Constitutional provisions are
required to be understood and interpreted with an object-oriented approach.
There is no quarrel  Page 146 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on

Wadettiwar v State Of Maharashtra & Ors | Surinder Mohan Arora & Ors v State
of Maharashtra & Ors 10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC and indeed there can be none about
this principle and equally the other that Constitution must not be construed
in a narrow and pedantic manner. Moreover, the general words have to be given
there full import and true meaning, and particularly when we are considering
the Constitution itself is another precept of equal importance. However, all
these principles have their application to a given fact situation and that
cannot be lost sight of. Even if the Petitioners insist that the conduct of
these Respondents merits our disapproval, and that their conduct is a blot on
the purity of elections and probity in public life, that by itself does not
allow us to conclude that SR Chaudhari's case is exactly on all fours as far
as the present petitions are concerned. That judgment is therefore
distinguishable on facts.
75\. In this context, Mr. Talekar expresses a secondary apprehension that if,
in the forthcoming elections, Respondents Nos. 5 and 6 are again not elected,
or do not contest, then, by claiming that a 'fresh term' has begun for the new
house, and the meter has, so to say, been reset to zero, these same non-
elected  Page 147 of 152 9th & 13th September 2019 ::: Uploaded on -

Cabinet for another six months. We need not consider that aspect of the matter
at all. At this stage, it is both premature and speculative (and defeatist,
for it assumes that the present ruling alliance will necessarily be returned
at the next polls). It seems to us clear, however, that the six-month period
is a single opportunity. No one can take a break before six months by
demitting the ofce of Minister and then be inducted again. That there is an
intervening election will make no diference. Article 164(4) is person-specifc,
and no person can be a minister without facing an election in six months. He
cannot come back again and again by taking, for illustration, a day's or a
month's gap or break between ministerial terms. That would undoubtedly be a
fraud on the Constitution and is clearly forbidden. For a non-legislator
inducted into a ministry, the terminus a quo is an election, not a mere
demitting of ofce. However, since we are not presently called upon to go into
this, we leave the Petitioners' contentions open in that regard.

76\. As far the judgment in the case of BR Kapur V State of Tamil Nadu,12 even
that turns on a peculiar factual position. In that case, a non-legislator was
made a Chief Minister and it was argued that he must possess qualifcations
under Article 173 and must not sufer from disqualifcations under Article 191
for membership of the legislature. It is in that context that the Supreme
Court held that it is its duty to interpret the Constitution even if the
answer to the question before it has a political efect. There again the
Supreme Court noted that the essential controversy was that the Election
Commission of India by an order dated 28th August 1997 dealt with the legal

of nominations were directed to take a note of the legal position and decide
accordingly about the validity or otherwise of the candidature of the
contestants disqualifed under Section 8 of the Representation of the Peoples
Act 1951. The nomination papers of the 2nd Respondent were rejected by a
speaking order by the returning ofcer on 24th April 2001. The order of the
Election Commission of India mentions clearly that despite suspension of 12
(2001) 7 SCC 231.

10-ASWP6996-19+J.DOC sentence and release on bail, the order of conviction
remains in operation. This order was not challenged. The 2nd Respondent did
not challenge the election of the respective candidates from these
constituencies by an election petition on the ground that her nomination was
wrongly rejected. The period of limitation for fling the election petition of
45 days was also over. Thus, the issue was that the rejection on the ground of
disqualifcation had reached fnality. It was therefore not permissible for such
a candidate or person to take over and be appointed as a Chief Minister and
that is how the matter was brought before the Supreme Court of India. A
totally ineligible candidate, already disqualifed from the inception was
sought to be appointed as a Chief Minister. A Chief Minister is of the State
and does not remain a mere leader of the largest single party in the House, on
being sworn in as such. The real issue therefore was whether by the above mode
can he/she enter the House. The answer is obviously no.

that even this judgment has any application to the facts and circumstances

outlines the powers of judicial review and enables us in certain circumstances
to interfere directly under Article 226 of the Constitution of India even when
the election of otherwise disqualifed candidates has not been challenged by

to the facts and circumstances before us. The Division Bench Judgment of the
Nagpur Bench of this Court is also distinguishable on facts.13 There, an
