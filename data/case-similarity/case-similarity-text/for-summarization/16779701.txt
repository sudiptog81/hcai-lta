creates lot of dust and particles which needs to be cleaning on regular basis
to carry uninterrupted production activity. Similarly, the pest control is
also very much necessary for such pollution prone industries. Therefore,
cleaning activity is directly used in the manufacture of the final product.
4.5 Travel agency service is again used for the employees for performing the
outside duties for the companies. Therefore, it is used for the overall
business of the company not for the individual's personal use.
4.6 Courier service is used for movement of samples, raw materials and mostly
for authorized documents such as orders, quotations, marketing documents,
instruction, cheques, etc. These activities are directly used in or in
relation to manufacture as well as business of the appellant's company.
Revenue could not bring anything on record contrary to the use of services
presented by the appellant. In respect of all the services, there are various
judgments passed by Tribunal and High Courts. Therefore, I am of the view that
all the services are indeed input services and eligible for Cenvat Credit.
Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside, appeals are allowed.

order is a non speaking order as it does not consider or deal with any of the

services is very wide definition and must not be read restrictively. This is a
settled position of law in the following judgments:
                                                 4                            E/11762/2018-SM

explanation above, all the services were used directly or indirectly in
relation to the manufacturing activity of the appellants and thus credit taken
by the appellants was clearly admissible. She also submits that since the
issue involved related to interpretation of certain provisions, thus, penalty
cannot be imposed in view of the order of GHCL Ltd. vs CCE 2009 (16) STR 89
(Tri- Ahm). The appellant has been filing returns. Thus, extended period of
limitation cannot be invoked while issuing the Show Cause Notice in view of
the judgment in the case of Parekh Plast (I) Pvt. Ltd. Vs CCE 2012 (25) STR 46
(Tri- Ahmedabad).
3\. Shri L. Patra, Learned Assistant Commissioner (Authorised Representative)
appearing on behalf of the Revenue reiterates the findings of the impugned
order. He submits that the appellant, at no point of time have established the
actual use of inputs. Therefore, Adjudicating Authority as well as
Commissioner (Appeals) have rightly denied the Cenvat Credit. He placed
reliance on the following judgments:

4\. I have carefully considered the rival submission made by both the sides
and perused the records. I find that as per the use of services explained by
the appellant, the appellants are entitled for the Cenvat Credit. The cab
operator service is used by the employees for attending outside work. And the
same is not used for their personal use or consumption. Therefore, having
considering the exclusion clause which came into force from 01 April, 2011,
cab operator service is 5 E/11762/2018-SM indeed used for the business of the
appellant's company. Therefore, it is an eligible input service.
4.1 The Commercial and Industrial Construction service was used for
construction of canteen which is a part of setting-up of factory which is
specifically included in the exclusion clause of definition of input services
up to 01 April, 2011. The appellant have given up the claim of credit on these
services amounting to Rs. 1,00,435/- for the period after 01 April, 2011.
Therefore, the demand of the same is upheld.
4.2 As regard the erection of Tarpaulin shed, it is observed that temporary
shed is used for storage of raw material and finished goods for protection of
the goods from rain water. Therefore, it is directly used in or in relation to
manufacture of final product.
4.3 As regard Air Travel Agency, the air travelling is used by the employees
of the company for company's business work. Therefore, it is not the service
which is used for individual, the service is used in or in relation to the
business of the company. Hence, use of service is for the company and not for
the individual.
4.4 As regard cleaning activity, since it is marble manufacturing industry, it
creates lot of dust and particles which needs to be cleaning on regular basis
to carry uninterrupted production activity. Similarly, the pest control is
also very much necessary for such pollution prone industries. Therefore,
cleaning activity is directly used in the manufacture of the final product.
4.5 Travel agency service is again used for the employees for performing the
outside duties for the companies. Therefore, it is used for the overall
business of the company not for the individual's personal use.
4.6 Courier service is used for movement of samples, raw materials and mostly
for authorized documents such as orders, quotations, marketing documents,
instruction, cheques, etc. These activities are directly used in or in
relation to manufacture as well as business of the appellant's company.
Revenue could not bring anything on record contrary to the use of services
presented by the appellant. In respect of all the services, there are various
judgments passed by Tribunal and High Courts. Therefore, I am of the view that
all the services are indeed input services and eligible for Cenvat Credit.
Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside, appeals are allowed.
