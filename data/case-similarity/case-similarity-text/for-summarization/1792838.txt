[ Vide West Bengal Act 14 of 1956, sec. 70 and Sch. I, para 3]. COMMENTS
(i) Declaration under section 6 need not contain reasons or refer to the
objections for every particular land. It is true that section 6 uses the words
particular land but while referring to its satisfaction in regard to the
need to acquire the entire land, the Government need not refer to every piece
of particular Land; Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban, AIR 2000 SC
3737.
(ii) According to sub-section (1), the period of two years referred to in
section 11A shall be computed with reference to this provision requiring a
declaration' to be made to the effect that land is acquired for public
utility purpose; Ram Jiyawan v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1994 All 38.
(iii) The period of two years referred to in section 11A shall be computed by
counting from the last of the publication dates, as per the prescribed modes
of publication:
(a) publication in the Official Gazette,
(b) publication in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in which
the land is situate; and
(c) causing public notice of the substance of the declaration to be given at
convenient places in the said locality; Ram Jiyawan v. State of Uttar Pradesh,
AIR 1994 All 38.
(iv) Fulfilling the Constitutional obligation under article 300A, the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 is the law providing for
(a) acquisition of land;
(b) taking over possession of land;
(c) assessment of compensation; and
(d) payment and compensation. Without possession, acquisition is futile while
without payment, acquisition is arbitrary and violative of article 14; Ram
Jiyawan v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1994 All 38.
(v) If the mandatory provisions relating to acquisition' are breached, such
acquisition itself falls but if there is a breach of subsidiary provisions
relating to taking over of possession, such possession is illegal, without
prejudice to the acquisition itself being legal; Ram Jiyawan v. State of Uttar
Pradesh, AIR 1994 All 38.
(vi) Any acquisition of land has to be preceded by issue of notification and
conformation to the requirements of the provisions lest the acquisition itself
falls; Ram Jiyawan v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1994 All 38.
(vii) Even though there can be only one date of publication (last of
publication date of all modes), merely employing one of the modes within one
year of publication of notification under section 4 will not suffice lest the
land acquisition proceeding falls or lapses. So, publication of all modes
within one year of publication of notification under section 4 is a necessary,
mandatory condition; Jagrup Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1993 Raj 157.
(viii) In the event of a particular public purpose' declared at the
commencement of land acquisition proceedings ceasing to exist subsequently,
such land may ultimately be utilised for any other public purpose, without
affecting the validity of land acquisition proceedings; Jagrup Singh v. State
of Rajasthan, AIR 1993 Raj 157.
(ix) When there was a delay of nearly six years on the part of the respondents
in continuing the land acquisition proceedings, it was held that it was not
open to the respondents to raise that point against the appellants;
