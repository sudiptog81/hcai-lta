Post Script: Before this order has been corrected and released, Supreme Court
has vide Order dated 16th February, 2017 in WP(Civil) No.341/2008 titled Sabu
Mathew George Vs. Union of India referred to the principle/doctrine of
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 18 of 19 "auto block" and constitution by Google
India, Microsoft Corporation (I) Pvt. Ltd. and Yahoo India of an "In House
Expert Body" to detect violation on their respective platforms of the
provisions of The Pre-
conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection)
Act, 1994 (PNDT Act), as the counsel for the plaintiffs herein has been
contending, in the context of enforcement of the PNDT Act, 1994.
However that was under Section 22 of PNDT Act and not under the IT Act or
Rules.
filed affidavit of service of both the defendants.
2\. One gentleman disclosing himself to be Mr. Amit Shabhulal Kotak appears
and the counsel for the plaintiffs states that she identifies him as defendant
No.1. The said Mr. Amit Shabhulal Kotak has also handed over his Driving
Licence and a self attested photocopy of the same be kept by the Court Master
on the file.
3\. The defendant No.1 states that he has no objection to the suit, insofar as
for the relief of permanent injunction, being decreed against him subject to
the plaintiffs giving up their claim for damages and accounts.
4\. The counsel for the plaintiffs is agreeable thereto.
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 1 of 19
5\. I have ensured by speaking to Mr. Amit Shabhulal Kotak in vernacular
language that he understands the consequences.
6\. Accordingly, a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff and against the
defendant No.1 in terms of prayer paragraph 51(a), (b) & (c) of the plaint,
leaving the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 to bear their own costs.
7\. Decree sheet be drawn up.
8\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 eBay India Private Limited (eBay) also
appears. The defendant No.2 has also filed documents.
9\. The plaintiffs (and of which plaintiff No.2 Mr. Mahesh Gupta is the
Chairman and Managing Director of the plaintiff No.1) have instituted this
suit pleading (i) that it is a manufacturer of water purifiers and has sought
protection by obtaining design registrations under the Designs Act, 2000 in
respect of the aesthetic appearance of its water purifier systems; (ii) that
the products covered by the plaintiffs registered designs are being marketed
and sold by the plaintiffs; (iii) that making, using or sale of any water
purifier using the shape and design as registered by the plaintiffs
constitutes piracy under the Designs Act; (iv) that the plaintiffs have a huge
presence in the online market place with e-commerce websites including the
defendant No.2; (v) that the defendant No.2 eBay is an e-commerce platform /
portal through which sellers of various products showcase, sell their products
and carrying on business; (vi) that the defendant No.2 eBay is also
responsible for addressing the grievances of sellers including the claims of
infringement through the website; (vii) that the defendant No.2 eBay acts as
an „intermediary‟, facilitating the transaction between a seller and buyers of
various goods; (viii) that the defendant No.1 is a manufacturer and/or trader
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 2 of 19 of water purifier systems whose shape, look
and appearance are deceptively similar and infringe the water purifiers of the
plaintiffs for which the plaintiffs have been granted registrations; (ix) that
the defendant No.1 sells its goods to various customers through the website of
the defendant No.2;
(x) that the action of the defendant No.2 eBay of permitting the defendant
No.1 to advertise, offer for sale and sell its water purifiers through the
portal of the defendant No.2 amounts to infringement of the plaintiffs rights
under Section 19 of the Designs Act; (xi) that as per the guidelines
formulated under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), intermediaries
such as the defendant No.2 are expected to observe certain due diligence while
discharging their duties including an obligation to inform users not to host,
display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share information that
infringes the intellectual property rights of any party as well as to take
steps to avoid sale of such infringing products; (xii) that when one brings to
the attention of the intermediary such violations, the intermediary is
required to take down all such offending content; (xiii) that the plaintiffs
drew the attention of the defendant No.2 eBay to the infringement by the
defendant No.1 as well as by the defendant No.2; (xiv) that the plaintiff also
brought to the notice of the defendant No.2 eBay that several others who were
similarly offering for sale and selling water purifier systems infringing the
intellectual property rights of the plaintiffs had been injuncted by the
Courts; (xv) that though the defendant No.2 eBay in its response stated that
it had removed all the products complained of and also undertook to in future
remove all the infringing products complained of by the plaintiffs but the
plaintiffs found that a large number of other infringing products were being
offered for sale / sold on the portal of the defendant No.2; and, (xvi) that
the defendant No.2 CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 3 of 19 eBay has not taken steps
for removal of the other infringing products.
10\. The plaintiffs, in the suit have sought the relief against the defendant
No.2 of (i) direction to take down, remove, delist all products infringing the
registered designs of the plaintiffs; (ii) prohibitory injunction from
allowing products infringing the registered designs of the plaintiffs being
offered for sale and sold from the portal of the defendant No.2 eBay; and,
(iii) for account of profits made.
11\. The suit came up before this Court first on 21st December, 2016 when it
was enquired from the counsel for the plaintiffs as to how the relief of
rendition of accounts and recovery of damages were sought against the
defendant No.2. It was further enquired, whether not the defendant No.2 is but
a medium through which the defendant No.1 and others were claimed to be
selling the infringing products and how the plaintiffs, against the defendant
No.2 eBay, could claim reliefs of rendition of accounts and recovery of
damages. It was further enquired, whether not the position of the defendant
No.2 eBay was the same as that of a newspaper containing advertisement of
infringing products and whether not the commission charged by the defendant
No.2 eBay was at par by the advertising charges of a newspaper.
12\. Be that as it may, summons of the suit were issued and by way of ex-
parte order, the defendant No.2 eBay directed to block the access to the
Universal Resource Locators (URLs) from which the infringing products were
claimed to be sold. The defendant No.2 eBay was also directed to, on the next
date of hearing, disclose in a sealed cover the particulars and details of the
owners/manufacturers/sellers of the infringing products as registered CS(COMM)
No.1655/2016 Page 4 of 19 and recorded with the defendant No.2 eBay.
13\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 eBay states that the defendant No.2,
in accordance with law, immediately on receipt of complaints from the
plaintiffs has from time to time been removing the offending products from its
website and the documents filed by the defendant No.2 eBay in this Court
support the said plea. The counsel for defendant No.2, on behalf of defendant
no.2, also makes a statement before the Court that the defendant No.2, on
receipt of any complaint in future also from the plaintiffs shall, in
accordance with law, remove the offending products from its websites.
14\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 eBay further states that in compliance
with para 17 of the earlier order dated 21st December, 2016, the details of
the owners/manufacturers/sellers of the offending products recorded with it,
have been brought to this Court in a sealed cover.
15\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 has handed over the sealed envelope.
16\. The same has been opened and the contents thereof have been perused. The
same contains the names and addresses of sixteen persons who had earlier
posted their products on the websites of the defendant No.2 and which products
the defendant No.2 removed on receipt of complaint of the plaintiffs.
17\. I have enquired from the counsel for the defendant No.2, whether the
defendant No.2 has any objection to the said particulars being furnished to
the plaintiffs.
18\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 states that the defendant No.2
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 5 of 19 would be bound by the orders of the Court.
19\. Since the particulars are of the persons whose products were removed from
the websites of the defendant No.2 on the complaint of the plaintiffs and who
have not protested against the same, I see no reason to not share the said
particulars with the plaintiffs, inasmuch as without the same, the plaintiffs
would be unable to take legal action, if any required to be taken, against the
said persons.
20\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 has, on asking, handed over a copy of
the said particulars to the counsel for the plaintiffs.
21\. The counsel for the plaintiffs states that the plaintiffs in the
documents filed with the plaint, have referred to over 100 infringing products
and the particulars given are of 16 only.
22\. For the reason aforesaid, the defendant No.2 is also directed to provide
to the plaintiffs the particulars of the others as listed in the documents
filed by the plaintiffs.
23\. The counsel for the plaintiffs contends that "there is a larger question
at issue". It is argued that the statement aforesaid of the counsel for the
defendant No.2 eBay to, in future also on receipt of complaints from the
plaintiffs remove the offending products from its website, does not serve the
purpose of the plaintiffs. It is contended that once the plaintiffs have
lodged a complaint with the defendant No.2 with respect to the offending
product of one of the sellers / retailers, the defendant No.2 eBay on its own,
before hosting a product of any other sellers / retailers, should verify,
whether the same also infringes the registered design of the plaintiffs. It is
contended that the defendant No.2 is an „intermediary‟ within the meaning of
the IT Act and is CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 6 of 19 required to devise a
mechanism to, before hosting any product for sale on its system/website,
verify whether the same infringes the intellectual property rights of any
other person.
24\. The counsel for the plaintiffs in this regard has drawn attention to
Rules 3(1), 3(2)(d), 3(3) & 3(4) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries
Guidelines) Rules, 2011 (IT Rules) and which along with Rules 3(5), 3(6),
3(7), 3(8) & 3(11), also found to be relevant, are as under:
> "3. Due diligence to be observed by intermediary--The intermediary shall

> Officer shall redress the complaints within one month from the date of
> receipt of complaint."
25\. The counsel for the plaintiffs has also drawn attention to Section
22(1)(c) of the Designs Act to contend that even a person who, knowing that
the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof has been applied to
any article in any class of articles in which the design is registered,
without the consent of the registered proprietor, publishes or exposes or
causes to be published or exposed for sale that article, is guilty of piracy
of registered design.
26\. The counsel for the defendant No.2 eBay has referred to Section 79 of the
IT Act providing that an intermediary shall not be liable for any third party
information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by CS(COMM)
No.1655/2016 Page 9 of 19 him as long as the function of the intermediary is
limited to providing access to a communication system over which information
made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted
and does not initiate the transmission, select the receiver of the
transmission or modify the information contained in the transmission and so
long as observes due diligence while discharging his duties under the Act and
also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe in
this behalf.
27\. The counsel for the plaintiffs refers to Section 79(3) of the Act and
contends that the exemption from liability of intermediary does not apply if
the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced commission of
unlawful act or where the intermediary, upon receiving actual knowledge, or on
being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any
information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer
resource, controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit the unlawful
act, fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material on that
resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner. It is argued that once
the plaintiffs have intimated the defendant No.2 eBay of their registered
design and pointed out the URLs indulging in piracy, the obligation of the
defendant No.2 eBay as intermediary extends not only to removing the said URLs
but to ensuring that on no other URL/s also an infringing product is hosted.
It is argued that if inspite of such intimation by the plaintiffs any other
infringing product is hosted by any other person or on any other URL of the
defendant No.2, the defendant No.2 eBay is deemed to be in conspiracy and
having abetted and aided the infringement CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 10 of 19
within the meaning of Section 79(3) of the Act.
28\. I have enquired from the counsel for the plaintiffs, as to how under the
aforesaid IT Rules, obligations as sought to be imposed, can be imposed on the
defendant No.2 eBay as an intermediary. The aforesaid IT Rules only require
the intermediary to publish the rules and regulations and privacy policy and
to inform the users of its computer resources not to host, display, uphold or
publish any information that infringes any patent, trademark, copyright or
other proprietary rights. It is not the contention of the plaintiffs that the
defendant No.2 eBay has not published its rules and regulations or privacy
policy or has not informed users of its computer resources so. The IT Rules
further require the defendant no.2 eBay as an intermediary to, upon any person
as the plaintiffs approaching it in writing, of products infringing that
person‟s patent, trademark or copyright rights to within 36 hours disable the
infringing information. It is not the contention of the plaintiffs that the
defendant no.2, inspite of receipt of complaints of the plaintiffs has not
disabled the infringing information.
29\. What the plaintiffs seek is that the plaintiffs having once informed the
defendant no.2 eBay of water purifiers infringing its design having been
hosted on the platform of the defendant no.2, the defendant no.2 before
hosting any other water purifier of any other person on its portal should
screen the same to verify (even before the plaintiffs have complained with
respect thereto), whether the same infringes the design of the plaintiffs. To
put in another words, the counsel for the plaintiffs reads into the IT Rules
aforesaid an obligation on the intermediary to, after having been once
informed by any person of any content hosted on the portal of the defendant
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 11 of 19 no.2 eBay infringing the intellectual
property rights of that person, not only remove the said contents but in
future also screen other contents being hosted on its portal for such
infringement.
30\. To hold that an intermediary, before posting any information on its
computer resources is required to satisfy itself that the same does not
infringe the intellectual property rights of any person, would amount to
converting the intermediary into a body to determine whether there is any
infringement of intellectual property rights or not. All persons claiming any
intellectual property rights will then, intimate the intermediaries of their
claims and the intermediaries then, before hosting any material on their
computer resources would be required to test the material vis-a-vis all such
claims lodged with them, else would be liable for infringement.
31\. My reading of the IT Rules aforesaid obliges the intermediary to
remove/disable the information hosted on the portal only on receipt of
complaint. The IT Rules, according to me do not oblige the intermediary to, of
its own, screen all information being hosted on its portal for infringement of
the rights of all those persons who have at any point of time complained to
the intermediary.
32\. I have enquired from the counsel for the plaintiffs whether not the
hosting of information on the portal of the defendant no.2 eBay is automatic,
without any human intervention and have further enquired that if it is so, how
can an intermediary as the defendant no.2 be directed to screen all
information being hosted on its portal for violation of rights of all those
who may have lodged complaints with the defendant no.2. It has also been
enquired, whether not such a direction would bring the business of CS(COMM)
No.1655/2016 Page 12 of 19 intermediaries as the defendant no.2 eBay to a
halt. It has yet further been enquired whether not to direct so would require
the intermediary as the defendant no.2 to become a Judge of what is infringing
and what is not infringing. The provision in the Rules requiring the
intermediary to on receipt of complaints take action is different from
requiring an intermediary to of its own take a call as to what is infringing
and what is not.
33\. The counsel for the plaintiffs though does not dispute that hosting of
information on the portal of the intermediary as the defendant no.2 is
automatic, without human intervention, but contends that the defendant no.2 as
an intermediary can also devise programmes to detect infringement and piracy.
Reference is made to Rule 3(8) and it is argued that requiring intermediary to
do so would be a reasonable measure and following reasonable security
practices. It is contended that infringing goods at a different URL/s prop up
on the portal of the defendant no.2 almost immediately after the plaintiffs
complain against one and the defendant no.2 removing/disabling the same. It is
argued that the plaintiffs cannot be expected to be vigilant so as to keep on
looking for infringing products on the portal of the defendant no.2 and on
other such similar portals. It is yet further argued that without the same,
the defendant no.2, by allowing infringing products to be sold from newly
appearing URL/s would be abetting and aiding infringement within the meaning
of Section 79(3) of the Act.
34\. I am unable to agree. For a case to be made out under Section 79(3),
making the provision of Section 79(1) exempting an intermediary from liability
to be inapplicable, the plaintiffs have to plead and prove conspiracy CS(COMM)
No.1655/2016 Page 13 of 19 or abetment or aiding or inducing within the
meaning of Section 79(3) of the IT Act. The words „conspired‟, „abetted‟,
„aiding‟ and „inducing‟ are legal terms meaning whereof has been settled for
long. They require pleading and proof of common intention. That is not the
case pleaded by the plaintiffs.
35\. Just like the counsel for the plaintiffs states that the plaintiffs
cannot be vigilant at all time, similarly the defendant no.2 intermediary
cannot be expected to exercise such vigilance. Moreover the question, whether
a intellectual property right has been infringed or not is more often than not
a technical question with which the Courts steeped in law also struggle and
nothing in the IT Act and the IT Rules requires an intermediary, after having
been once notified of the Intellectual Property Rights, not allow anyone else
to host on its portal infringing goods/matter. The intermediaries are not
possessed of the prowess in this respect. As aforesaid, it is a different
matter, when attention of the intermediary is invited to infringing product
and complaint made with respect thereto. Merely because intermediary has been
obliged under the IT Rules to remove the infringing content on receipt of
complaint cannot be read as vesting in the intermediary suo motu powers to
detect and refuse hosting of infringing contents.
36\. The counsel for the plaintiffs has drawn attention to the judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in Tiffany (NJ) Inc. and
Tiffany and Company Vs. eBay Inc. 600 F. 3d 93 (2nd Cir. 2010) particularly to
paras 5,7 & 8 thereof.
37\. I am unable to read the judgment aforesaid as laying down that
intermediaries are required to conduct such self determination. The charge of
Tiffany in that case against eBay Inc. was of continuing to supply its
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 14 of 19 services to the sellers of counterfeit
Tiffany goods while knowing or having reason to know that such sellers were
infringing Tiffany‟s mark. All that the Court held was that if eBay Inc. had
reasons to suspect that counterfeit Tiffany goods were being sold through its
website and intentionally shielded itself from discovering the offending
listings or the identity of the sellers behind them, it could be charged with
knowledge of those sales. It was held that a service provider is not permitted
wilful blindness and when it has reason to suspect that users of its services
are infringing a protected mark, it may not shield itself from learning of the
particular infringing transactions by looking the other way. However the said
observations are followed by "eBay did not ignore the information it was given
about counterfeits sales on its website". Thus what has been held is that an
intermediary would be considered as acting wilfully blind and looking the
other way only when has been given information of infringement and ignores the
same.
38\. The counsel for the defendant no.2 relied on Myspace Inc. Vs. Super
Cassettes Industries Ltd. 2016 SCC OnLine 6382. The Division Bench of this
Court therein was concerned with the claim of Myspace as an intermediary
having refused to take down the infringing contents from its website resulting
in continued infringement and the claim of damages therefor. It was held (i)
that Section 79(3) read with Rule 3(4) supra posit an intermediary, on
receiving "actual knowledge" or upon obtaining knowledge from the affected
person in writing or through email, to within 36 hours of receiving such
information disable access to such information; (ii) that if copyright owners
inform the intermediary specifically about infringing works and despite such
notice the intermediary does not take down the CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 15
of 19 content, then alone is the intermediary denied safe harbour; (iii) it is
for the plaintiff to show that despite giving specific information the
intermediary did not comply therewith; (iv) that Section 51(a)(ii) of the IT
Act, in the case of internet intermediaries, contemplates actual knowledge and
not general awareness; and, (v) to impose liability on an intermediary,
conditions under Section 79 of the IT Act have to be fulfilled. The counsel
for the plaintiffs drew attention to para 64 of the judgment where the
Division Bench has noticed the draft report "The role of intermediaries in
Advancing Public Policy Objective" of Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development inter alia requiring an intermediary to introduce "filtering"
where tools are used to identify and remove infringing content automatically.
However the Division Bench has not held that the IT Act and the Rules
aforesaid require the intermediary to provide filtering. Rather, I have
enquired from the counsel for the plaintiffs whether not the Division Bench
has ultimately directed the intermediary Myspace in that case to remove the
infringing content only on receipt of notice from the Super Cassettes
Industries Ltd. in that regard and that if what the counsel for the plaintiffs
herein is contending were to be accepted, the Division Bench would have
directed Myspace to ensure that no information infringing the copyright of
Super Cassettes Industries Ltd. in its entire repertoire shall be hosted on
its portal.
39\. The counsel for the defendants has also referred to (i) Order dated 3rd
April, 2013 of Supreme Court in CA No.5168/2000 titled Sanchayani Savings
Investment (I) Ltd. Vs. State of West Bengal; (ii) Order dated 9th July, 2014
of this Court in CS(OS) No.1402/2014 titled Bayrische Motoren CS(COMM)
No.1655/2016 Page 16 of 19 Werk G (BMW Group) Vs. Jagdishlal Batra; (iii)
Order dated 2nd and 3rd September, 2015 of High Court of Bombay in Suit (L)
No.696/2015 titled Faber-Castell Aktiengesellschaft Vs. Cello Pens Pvt. Ltd.;
(iv) Order dated of 15th January, 2015 of High Court of Madras in C.S.
No.540/2014 titled MRF Limited Vs. Chandan Sood; (v) Order dated 18th
November, 2015 of this Court in CS(OS) 2998/2015 titled Eicher Motors Limited
Vs. WWW.Ebay.in; (vi) Order dated 24th August, 2016 of this Court in CS(COMM)
No.957/2016 titled Eicher Motors Limited Vs. Saurabh Katar
(vii) Myspace Inc. Vs. Super Cassettes Industries Ltd. supra; and, (viii)
Order dated 28th June, 2016 of High Court of Bombay in Suit No.1014/2015
titled Siddhi Vinayak Knots & Prints Private Limited Vs. E-Bay India Private
Limited but need to discuss the same in detail is not felt. Suffice it is to
state that the question as has been raised by the counsel for the plaintiffs
herein was not raised expressly in any of the judgments aforesaid.
40\. I am further of the view that had the intention of the Legislature been
to require the intermediaries as the defendant no.2 eBay herein to be vigilant
as the plaintiff reads the IT Act and the Rules to require it to be, the
Legislature would have merely observed that the intermediary will not permit
to be hosted on its website any information infringing intellectual property
rights of any other person if such person had informed the intermediary of the
same. However the Legislature has not done so and has required the
intermediaries as the defendant no.2 to only declare to all its users its
policy in this regard and advise them not to host any infringing information
on the website of the intermediary and to on receipt of complaint remove the
same within 36 hours.
CS(COMM) No.1655/2016 Page 17 of 19
41\. During the hearing I had also enquired from the counsel for the
plaintiffs whether not the position of an intermediary is the same as the
position of an owner of immoveable property or of publisher of a newspaper or
magazine in physical form and that whether an owner of immoveable property can
be required to keep vigilance that the person allowed by him to use the
property does not while so using infringes the intellectual property rights of
any other person or to while allowing advertisements to be published in its
newspaper and magazine keep vigilance that the contents of the advertisement
do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any person. No provision
of law requiring owners of immoveable property or publishers of newspapers and
magazines to maintain such vigilance was shown.
42\. I am of the view that to require an intermediary to do such screening
would be an unreasonable interference with the rights of the intermediary to
carry on its business.
43\. It is not thus deemed expedient to issue any such direction to the
defendant No.2.
44\. The suit, insofar as against the defendant No.2, is disposed of binding
the defendant No.2 to its statements aforesaid and to the directions issued to
the defendant No.2 in this order and leaving the plaintiffs and the defendant
No.2 to bear their own costs.
Decree sheet be drawn up.
