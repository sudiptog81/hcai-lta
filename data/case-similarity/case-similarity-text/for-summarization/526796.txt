Kerala High Court
Unknown vs State Of Kerala Rep. By on 20 November, 1999
           prescribed in Rule 6(7) and 6(8) of the CST (Kerala) Rules?
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                             3
           iii)    Whether the Tribunal is correct in holding that Rubber
           Cess element is rightly included in the interstate sales turnover?
           Is not the finding illegal, and unsustainable on a correct and
           proper interpretation of Sections 2(g), 2(h), 2(j), 6 and 8A of the
           C.S.T. Act?
           iv)     Whether the Tribunal is correct in applying the principle
           laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision reported in 108
           S.T.C. 583 in deciding the issue in the case with substantial
           situational difference?
           v)      Is not the decision of the Supreme Court reported in 108
           S.T.C. 583 distinguishable on facts?
           vi)     Is not the Tribunal erred in proceeding as if the definition
           of the terms 'sale', 'sale price' and 'turnover' under K.G.S.T.Act
           and C.S.T.Act are essentially the same?"
           5. The assessment         proceedings has been completed           by the
the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case and has come to the conclusion that
the activity of the petitioner is in the nature of works contract and
therefore liable to pay the General Sales Tax Act.
17\. In our opinion, the Tribunal has correctly applied the law declared by
the Apex Court and has correctly come to the conclusion that the activity of
the petitioner is in the nature of the works contract and therefore exigible
to tax under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act. In view of the above
discussion, we are of the opinion that the orders passed by the Tribunal is in
consonance with the law declared by the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case
, which has been confirmed by the Apex Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd vs.
Union of India.
18\. In view of the above, the questions of law framed by the assessee require
to be answered against the assessee and in favour the Revenue. Accordingly,
the revision petition requires to be rejected and it is rejected. SALES TAX
REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  11 In the facts and circumstances of the case, the
parties are directed to bear their own costs.
           5. The assessment         proceedings has been completed           by the
    assessing authority for the assessment years 1988-89 to1992-93 under the
    provisions of the CST Act.    While completing the assessments, the assessing
    authority  had not included the cess paid by the assessee in the taxable
    turnover of the assessee.     After the decision of the Apex Court in State of
    Kerala vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd. ([1998] 108 S.T.C. 583) , the
    revisional authority, in exercise of his powers under section 35 of the Act,
    1963, had issued a show cause notice to the assesee directing him to show
    cause as to why the orders of assessment passed by the assessing authority
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                           4
    for the aforesaid assessment years should not be revised and why the matter
    should not be remanded back to the assessing authority to re-do the matter in
    accordance with law and in consonance with the observations made by the
    Apex Court in State of Kerala vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd.                The
    assessee had filed its detailed objections to the show cause notice so issued
    by the revisional authority. The revisional authority, after considering each
    one of the objections so filed by the assessee, has come to the conclusion
    that under section 35 of the Act, 1963, the revisional authority has jurisdiction
    to invoke his powers to bring to tax the escaped turnover in the order of
    assessment passed under the provisions of C.S.T. Act by virtue of Section 9
    (2) of the Act.
            6.  Aggrieved by the    findings and the conclusions reached by the
    revisional authority, the assessee had carried the matter by way of second
    appeals before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal in T.A.Nos. 1122 to 1126 of
    1999. The Tribunal, by its order dated 20th November 1999, after considering
    all the grounds    urged by the assessee has rejected the appeals.        While
    holding that the revisional authority can exercise its powers under section 35
    of the Act, 1963 to bring to tax the escaped turnover, it had relied upon the
    observations made by the various High Courts and also            the language
    employed in section 9 (2) of the C.S.T. Act and has proceeded to hold that
    the Deputy Commissioner being an assessing authority under Kerala General
    Sales Tax Act, is competent to invoke the revisional powers under section 35
    of the K.G.S.T. Act, 1963, in respect of C.S.T. assessment order as well.
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                                5
            7. In so far as the scope of revisional powers, the Tribunal , in
    paragraph 19 of its order, has stated that the revisional authority can invoke
    its powers under section 35 of the Act, 1963 to bring to tax the escaped
    turnover.    To arrive at that conclusion, the Tribunal has relied upon the
    decision of the Full Bench of this court in Madras Rubber Factory Ltd. vs.
    State of Kerala (([1979] 44 S.T.C. 208) and the decision of the Division
    Bench of this court in Roy Jacob vs. State of Kerala ([1998] 109 S.T.C.
    51) . In the Madras Rubber Factory Ltd vs. State of Kerala, the Full Bench
    of this court has stated as under:
            "The power of assessing escaped turnover under section 19 of
            the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, and the power of
            revision under section       35     are two distinct  and separate
            powers. They have been conferred on two different authorities ,
            the power of revision being conferred on a superior authority. A
            valid exercise of the revisional power is not an infringement of
            the power of assessing escaped turnover. There is no bar or
            inhibition against getting at escaped turnover in exercise of the
            revisional power under section 35, so long as the grounds for
            exercise of that power are made out, viz., that the order is
            vitiated by illegality, irregularity or impropriety."
            8. Following the Full Bench decision of this Court, a Division Bench of
    this court in Roy Jacob vs. State of Kerala ([1998] 109 S.T.C. 51)         has
    stated as under:
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                              6
            "The exercise of       powers under section 35 of the       Kerala
            General Sales Tax Act, 1963 by the Deputy Commissioner,
            when admittedly          escapement     was detected after the
            completion of the assessment for the year 1990-91, was correct
            and proper."
           9.     Shri Jose Joseph, learned counsel for the petitioner/assessee
    would contend that the revisional authority,       by invoking his powers under
    section 35 of the Act, 1963 is not authorised to bring to tax        the escaped
    turnover, if any, in the assessment orders passed under the provisions of
    C.S.T. Act.    Alternatively, it is contended by the learned counsel that if there
    is any escaped turnover, the same can be brought to tax by the assessing
    authority, by invoking his powers under section 19 of the Act and that cannot
    be done by the revisional authority.
           10. In so far as the second contention, raised by the learned counsel
    for the petitioner/assessee, in our opinion, that issue   is no more res integra,
    in view of the law declared by the Division Bench of this court , to which we
    have already made a reference in the earlier paragraph.           Therefore, the
    submission of the learned counsel on the second issue need not be
    considered by us, since it is only academic.
           11.     To answer the first issue raised by the learned counsel for the
    petitioner, firstly we need to notice the provisions of Section 9(2) of the C.S.T.
    Act. Therefore, the said provision is extracted and it reads as under:-
           "Subject to the other provisions of this Act and the rules made
           thereunder the authorities for the time being empowered to
           assess, re-assess, collect and       enforce payment    of any tax
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                            7
           under the general sales tax law of the appropriate State shall,
           on behalf of the Government of India, assess, re-assess, collect
           and enforce payment of tax, including any interest or penalty ,
           payable by a dealer under this Act as if the tax or interest or
           penalty payable by such a dealer under this Act is a tax or
           interest or penalty payable under the general sales tax law of
           the State; and for this purpose they may exercise all or any of
           the powers they have under the general sales tax law of the
           State; and the provisions of such law , including provisions
           relating to returns, provisional assessment advance payment of
           tax, registration of the transferee of any business, imposition of
           the tax liability of a person carrying     on business     on the
           transferee of, or successor to such business, transfer of liability
           of any firm or Hindu undivided family to pay tax in the event of
           the dissolution of such firm or partition of such family, recovery
           of tax from        third parties, appeals, reviews, revisions,
           references , refunds, rebates, interest or penalty , charging or
           payment of interest compounding of offences and treatment of
           documents furnished by a dealer        as confidential shall apply
           accordingly.
                  Provided that if any State or part thereof there is no
           general sales tax law in force , the Central Government may, by
           rules made in this behalf make necessary provision for all or any
           of the matters specified in this sub-section."
           12. Sub-section (2) of Section 9 vest the power with state authorities to
    assess or re-assess tax, levy penalties, deal with appeals and other remedies,
    recover the tax as finally determined and carry out all other functions
    necessary in those matters.        Therefore, the Deputy Commissioner was
    competent to invoke his revisional powers under Section 35 of the K.G.S.T.
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                             8
    Act in respect of assessment orders passed under the C.S.T. Act.           In the
    instant case, as we have already noticed, there was escapement of turnover
    under the provisions of the Act. In order to bring to tax the escaped turnover ,
    the revisional authority has exercised his powers under section 35 of the Act,
    1963 in view of the decision of the Apex Court in the case of State of Kerala
    vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd ([1998] 108 STC 583 ). Therefore, we are
    of the opinion, firstly the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes was
    justified in invoking his revisional powers to bring to tax the escaped turnover
    in the assessment orders passed under the C.S.T. Act.
                     13. In the appeal filed by the assessee, the Tribunal has raised
    two issues for its consideration and decision. They are, whether the Deputy
    Commissioner was competent to invoke his revisional powers in respect of an
    assessment completed under the C.S.T. Act and that the cess paid under the
    Rubber Act does not form part of interstate sales turnover of the producer of
    rubber, even if it may form part of the purchase turnover of a rubber dealer.
    The Tribunal by its well considered order has answered both the issues
    against the assessee. On issue No.1, the Tribunal has observed:
                     "We may note the powers for reviews, revisions and
            references are provided in the latter portion of Section 9(2) of
            the CST Act on equal footing. in the above two cases, we
            have seen that the courts have held that the provisions for
            reference under State Act could be invoked in respect of
            liability under Central Sales Tax by virtue of Section 9(2) of
            CST Act.     The revision power of Deputy Commissioner is
            similar to the power of the Commissioner for entertaining
            reference applications. Therefore, we have no hesitation to
            hold that the Deputy Commissioner can legally invoke the suo
            motu revision power under Section 35 of the KGST read with
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                           9
           Section 9(2) in respect of an assessment order passed under
           CST Act.      Further, the Deputy Commissioner is also an
           assessing authority under the KGST Act empowered to
           assess, re-assess, collect and enforce payment of any tax
           under the General Sales Tax Law of the State.           Revision
           proceedings in relation of re-opening of assessment is initiation
           of   or    continuation   of  proceedings    for   assessment,
           re-assessment, collections and enforcement of payment of tax.
           Section 9(2) of the CST Act authorises the authorities
           empowered under the General Sales Tax Law of the State to
           exercise all the powers they have under the general sales tax
           law of the State, including provisions relating to revision in
           respect    of   assessment,   re-assessment,    collection  and
           enforcement of tax due under CST Act.              The Deputy
           Commissioner being an assessing authority under the Kerala
           General Sales Tax Act, Deputy Commissioner is competent to
           invoke the revisional powers under Section 35 of the KGST Act
           in respect of a CST assessment order as well. The Deputy
           Commissioner has not therefore over stepped his jurisdiction
           as contended by the counsel for the appellant. The revision
           orders are hence valid and as authorised by law.".
                   14. In our view, the reasonings and the conclusion reached by
    the Tribunal is in accordance with what we have observed in the course of our
    order.  Therefore, no exception can be taken to the findings and conclusion
    reached by the Tribunal on this issue. Therefore, we confirm the findings of
    the Tribunal on this issue.
                   15. In so far as the second issue that they have raised for their
    consideration, is now squarely covered by the decision of Apex Court in the
    case of State of Kerala vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd. (1998) 6 KTR 118
    (SC).    Applying the principles laid down in that case, the Tribunal has
    answered this issue against the assessee. We do not think that the Tribunal
    has gone wrong in applying the principles laid down in Madras Rubber
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                          10
    Factory's case to answer the second issue against the assessee.
                   16. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the orders passed by
    the authorities under the Act and the Tribunal requires to be sustained by us.
    Accordingly, the revision petitions requires to be rejected and they are
    rejected. Pending C.M.Ps are also disposed of.
                   Ordered accordingly.

SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003
...................................................................................
Dated this the 14th August , 2007 O R D E R H.L. Dattu, C.J.:
This revision petition is filed questioning the legality or otherwise of the
orders passed by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal in T.A.No. 552 of 2002 dated
29th April, 2003. The assessment year in question is 1988-89.
2\. The assessee is engaged in the business of running a photo processing lab
. According to the assessee, his activity is confined to taking of photographs
of customers and delivering their photographs . This activity, according to
the assessee, is a skilled labour, which is not exigible to tax.
3\. The assessee had filed his annual returns before the assessing authority .
The same is rejected by the assessing authority . After such rejection, the
assessing authority had issued a pre-assessment notice, proposing certain
turnovers to be exigible to tax under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963
(hereinafter referred to as 'Act'). The view of the assessing authority is
that the activity of the assessee would come within the meaning of the
expression "works contract" and accordingly, had levied tax on the taxable
turnover of the assessee. Aggrieved by the said order, the assessee had
carried the matter in an appeal before the first appellate authority. The
first appellate authority had allowed the appeal and had issued certain
directions to the assessing authority to re-do the assessment in SALES TAX
REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  2 accordance with law and in accordance with the
observations made in the course of the order.
4\. After the disposal of the appeal, the assessing authority had passed yet
another order. In the said order, the assessing authority had once again
levied the tax under the Act, treating the activity of the assessee as "works
contract", which is exigible to tax under the Act. This order of the assessing
authority was the subject matter of the appeal before the first appellate
authority and the first appellate authority had allowed the appeal of the
assessee. Being aggrieved by the above said order, the State had carried the
matter in appeal before the Salestax Appellate Tribunal in T.A.No. 552 of
2002\. The Tribunal, by its order dated 29.04.2003, has rejected the appeal
following the observations made by the Apex Court in Associated Cement
Companies Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs ([2001] 4 SCC 593) . In the orders
passed, the Tribunal had made the following observations:
> "7. The first appellate authority has accepted the contention of the
> assessee and allowed the appeal for the five years on the following finding.
> "The activity of the appellant is to develop and print out the exposed ,
> film brought by the customer in the appellant's colour lab. It is commonly
> known that the photo prints supplied by the appellant to the customer are
> not saleable in the open market as the same has no value. The Supreme Court
> in the case of Asst. Sales Tax Officer and others vs. B.C. Kame ([1977] STC
> 237) held that when a photographer undertakes to take photographs develop
> the negative or do other photographic SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  3
> work and thereafter supply the prints to the customers, he cannot be said to
> enter into a contract for sale of goods. On the contrary the contract is for
> use of skill and labour to bring out a desired results . The occupation of a
> photographer except in so far as he sells the goods purchased by him is
> essentially one of skill and labour. In the advanced technology the machine
> carry out the entire process by the help of a skilled person. Hence the
> colour photo printing is not a works contract but it involve essentially a
> labour and service."
> 8\. But the contention of the revenue is that the decision in Rainbow Colour
> Lab's case has been overruled in Associated Cement Company Ltd. vs.
> Commissioner of Customs. There is some force in the contention of the
> revenue. In Associated Cement Company Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Customs
> ([2001] 4 SC Case 593) the Honourable Supreme Court of India held as
> follows:
> "The Forty Sixth Amendment was made precisely with a view to empower the
> State to bifurcate the contract and to levy sales tax on the value of the

5\. Aggrieved by the said order passed by the Tribunal, the assessee is before
us in this Revision, filed under section 41 of the Act. The assessee has
raised the following questions of law for our consideration and decision; they
are as under:
"A. Is not the Photographic work - taking photograph, SALES TAX REVISION. No.
287 OF 2003  5 developing and printing films carried on by the assessee only a
skilled labour inexigible to tax? Can this activity be termed as works
contract and as a sequel assess such turnover to tax in the hands of the
assessee especially in the light of the judicial pronouncements like 39 STC
237, 103 STC 360, 118 STC 9 etc.?
B. Is not the order of assessment in the instant case clearly barred by
limitation?
C. Is not the proposal for levy of interest under Section 23(3) from the very
end of the assessment year concerned unjust, improper and illegal ? Is not
such a levy possible and permissible only with effect from the date of the
Tribunal order with which only in any event liability to tax has been finally
fastened on the assessee, on a true reading of Sect. 23(3) of the KGST Act?
6\. In so far as the questions of law B and C are concerned , the same was
never urged or argued either before the assessing authority or before the
Tribunal. Under section 41 of the Act, this Court can exercise its revisional
powers, if the Tribunal has erroneously decided or failed to decide any
questions of law.
7\. The questions of law- B and C , formulated for our consideration and
decision, were never urged or raised before the Tribunal . The Tribunal had no
occasion to adjudicate those questions of law. In view of that, it cannot be
said that the Tribunal had either failed to decide any questions of law or
erroneously decided any questions of law . In that view of the matter, we do
not intend to express any opinion on the questions of law- B and C raised by
the Revision Petitioner in this Revision Petition. SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287
OF 2003  6
8\. In so far as the question of law-A is concerned, Shri Raju Joseph, learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner would contend that the Tribunal was not
justified in relying upon the observations made by the Apex Court in
Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs ([2001] 4 SCC
593) to come to the conclusion that the activity of the assessee is exigible
to tax on the ground that the said activity is in the nature of a works
contract. Learned counsel would further submit that the decision rendered by
the Apex Court in Rainbow Colour Lab vs. State of M.P. ([2000] 118 STC 9 [SC])
is not overruled by any subsequent decision by the Apex Court and therefore,
the Tribunal was not justified in allowing the State 's appeals. In support of
their contention, learned counsel relied upon the observation made by the Apex
Court in Rainbow Colour Lab vs. State of M.P. ([2000] 118 STC 9 [SC]).
9\. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the Revenue, Shri Muhammed
Rafiq, would submit that the decision of the Apex Court in Rainbow Colour Lab
' s case was impliedly overruled by the Apex Court in Associated Cement
Companies Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs ([2001] 4 SCC 593) and that
decision of the Apex Court in Associated Cement Companies 's case has been
confirmed by the Apex Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and another vs. Union
of India and others ([2006] 145 STC 91).
10\. In Rainbow Colour Lab's case, the Apex Court was considering the
provisions of the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, SALES TAX REVISION.
No. 287 OF 2003  7 1958 and in that decision, the Apex Court has held that,
unless there is a sale and purchase of goods, either in fact or deemed, and
such sale is primarily intended and not incidental to the contract, the State
cannot impose sales tax on a works contract simpliciter on the basis of the
expanded definition found in Article 366 (29A) (b) of the Constitution and
that the work done by the photographer is only in the nature of service
contract, not involving any sale of goods. That was a decision rendered by two
learned Judges of the Apex Court.
11\. Subsequently, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Associated
Cement Companies Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Customs ([2001] 124 STC 59), while
considering the question whether drawings, designs, diskettes, manuals, etc.,
relating to machinery or industrial technology were 'goods' which could be
subjected to customs duty on their transaction value at the time of their
import, under the Customs Act, 1962 and the appellant's contention relying on
several decisions relating to levy of sales tax, that in contracts for supply
of services, there is no sale of goods and no customs duty could be imposed on
the intellectual property which was obtained, considered in detail all the
decisions including that in Rainbow Colour Lab ([2000] 118 STC 9), and held
that even though the decisions relating to levy of sales tax would have no
application to the case of levy of customs duty, the decision in Rainbow
Colour Lab required consideration, that the Forty-sixth Amendment was made
precisely with a view to empower the State to bifurcate the contract and to
levy sales tax on the value of the SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  8
materials involved in the execution of the works contract, notwithstanding
that the value may represent a small percentage of the amount paid for the
execution of the works contract, that the conclusion arrived at in Rainbow
Colour Lab ran counter to the express provision contained in Article 366 (29A)
as also of the Constitution Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Builders'
Association of India vs. Union of India ([1989] 73 STC 370).
12\. Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs' case, did
not relate to sales tax, but to customs duty, and the question whether there
is any sale of goods in a contract for supply of services, was specifically
raised for consideration. The said question was specifically considered with
reference to several decisions including the decision in Rainbow Colour Lab
[2000] 118 STC 9(SC), in great detail and what was stated by the court was not
intended to be a passing comment or casual observation. The Supreme Court
categorically laid down the principle relating to works contract and held that
the decision in Rainbow Colour Lab ran counter to the Constitution Bench
decision in Builder's Association [1989] 73 STC 370 and article 366(29A) even
though decisions relating to levy of sales tax had no application to the case
that was being considered by it relating to customs duty. The enunciation of
law and pronouncement by the three- Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in
Associated Cements Companies Ltd.'s [2001] 124 STC 59 (SC), is law declared
under article 141 and will SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  9 prevail over
the principle laid down in the two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in
Rainbow[2000] 118 STC 9 (SC).
13\. By the aforesaid observation in Associated Cement Companies's Case, the
three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has impliedly overruled the observation
made by the Apex Court in Rainbow Colour Lab's case .
14\. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd vs. Union of India, the Supreme Court, at
paragraphs 49 and 50 has observed as under:
> "49. This conclusion was doubted in Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs.
> Commissioner of Customs ([2001] 4 SCC 593) saying :
> "The conclusion arrived at in Rainbow Colour Lab case ([2000] 2 SCC 385 ),
> in our opinion, runs counter to the express provision contained in Article
> 366 (29A) as also of the Constitution Bench decision of this court in
> Builders' Assn. of India vs. Union of India ([1989] 2 SCC 645)" .
> 50\. We agree. After the 46th Amendment, the sale elements of those
> contracts which are covered by the six sub -clauses of clause (29A) of
> Article 366 are separable and may be subjected to sales tax by the States
> under entry 54 of List II and there is no question of the dominant nature
> test applying. Therefore, when in 2005, C.K. Jidheesh vs. Union of India
> ([2005] 8 SCALE 784) held that the aforesaid observations in Associated
> Cement were merely obiter and that Rainbow Colour Lab ([2000] 2 SCC 385) was
> still good law, it was not correct. It is necessary to note that Associated
> Cement ([2001] 4 SCC 593 ) did not say that in all cases of composite
> transactions the 46th Amendment would apply."
SALES TAX REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  10
15\. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has accepted the view expressed
by the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case . While saying so, it once again
reiterated that the decision rendered in Rainbow Colour Lab's case has been
subsequently overruled by the Apex Court and therefore, the levy of tax in
respect of transfer of goods involved in the execution of works contract of
the nature of work undertaken by a photographer in taking photographs,
developing and printing films is now enforceable.
16\. In the instant case, the Tribunal has relied upon what was observed by
the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case and has come to the conclusion that
the activity of the petitioner is in the nature of works contract and
therefore liable to pay the General Sales Tax Act.
17\. In our opinion, the Tribunal has correctly applied the law declared by
the Apex Court and has correctly come to the conclusion that the activity of
the petitioner is in the nature of the works contract and therefore exigible
to tax under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act. In view of the above
discussion, we are of the opinion that the orders passed by the Tribunal is in
consonance with the law declared by the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case
, which has been confirmed by the Apex Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd vs.
Union of India.
18\. In view of the above, the questions of law framed by the assessee require
to be answered against the assessee and in favour the Revenue. Accordingly,
the revision petition requires to be rejected and it is rejected. SALES TAX
REVISION. No. 287 OF 2003  11 In the facts and circumstances of the case, the

           5. The assessment         proceedings has been completed           by the
    assessing authority for the assessment years 1988-89 to1992-93 under the
    provisions of the CST Act.    While completing the assessments, the assessing
    authority  had not included the cess paid by the assessee in the taxable
    turnover of the assessee.     After the decision of the Apex Court in State of
    Kerala vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd. ([1998] 108 S.T.C. 583) , the
    revisional authority, in exercise of his powers under section 35 of the Act,
    1963, had issued a show cause notice to the assesee directing him to show
    cause as to why the orders of assessment passed by the assessing authority
    T.R.C. Nos. 116, 120, 121,122 AND 123 OF 2000
                                           4
    for the aforesaid assessment years should not be revised and why the matter
    should not be remanded back to the assessing authority to re-do the matter in
    accordance with law and in consonance with the observations made by the
    Apex Court in State of Kerala vs. Madras Rubber Factory Ltd.                The
    assessee had filed its detailed objections to the show cause notice so issued
    by the revisional authority. The revisional authority, after considering each
    one of the objections so filed by the assessee, has come to the conclusion
    that under section 35 of the Act, 1963, the revisional authority has jurisdiction
    to invoke his powers to bring to tax the escaped turnover in the order of
the Apex Court in Associated Cement's case and has come to the conclusion that
the activity of the petitioner is in the nature of works contract and
therefore liable to pay the General Sales Tax Act.

    1999. The Tribunal, by its order dated 20th November 1999, after considering

    holding that the revisional authority can exercise its powers under section 35
