                                     JUDGMENT
BRIEF STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THE DECISION:-
FACTUAL MATRIX-
1\. The present complaint has been filed by the complainant Mrs. Pooja Garg,
against the accused Mr. Ravinder Mittal under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as "NI Act"). The substance of
allegations and assertions of the complainant is that the complainant came in
contact with the accused, a real estate builder by profession via common
friend. It is the case of the complainant that on 20.12.2012 the accused
approached the complainant and influenced her to invest in the property
situated at ground floor bearing Plot No. 64, Property no. 1/276-B (Old No.
278-B), Abadi of Block No. 4, Shri Ram Nagar, G.T. Road, Village Chandrawalli
@ Shahdara, Delhi-110032 (hereinafter referred to as "the said property"). The
complainant booked the said property for a sale consideration of
Rs.28,70,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Eight Lakhs and Seventy Thousand only) for which
the complainant paid the earnest money to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- on
01.01.2013 against the receipt dated 01.01.2013. Thereafter, the accused
entered into an agreement to sell dated 02.01.2013 with the complainant. The
complainant made a further part payment of Rs.5,00,000/- against the receipt
dated 18.03.2013. After few months, the complainant got to know that the said
property got sealed and demolished by M.C.D. as a consequence of the non-
compliance with the building bye-laws and required procedures. In pursuance of
the same, the complainant orally cancelled the agreement dated 02.01.2013 and
further made a demand for the refund of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs only)
paid to the accused towards the advance part payment of the total sale
consideration.
2\. It is the case of the complainant that after repeated reminders and great
difficulty, the accused agreed to return the given amount alongwith the
interest and in lieu of the same issued a post-dated cheque bearing no. 798978
dated 05.03.2014 for an amount of Rs.12,50,000/- (Rupees Twelve lakhs and
fifty thousand only), drawn on Oriental Bank of Commerce, Vikas Marg, Laxmi
Nagar, Delhi-110092 (hereinafter referred as the cheque in question). The
complainant after duly intimating the accused presented the cheque in question
on 23.05.2014 to Indian Overseas Bank, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, Delhi. However,
the said cheque got dishonoured with the remark, "stop payment by the CC No.
530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 2 of 15 drawee" on 26.05.2014.
The complainant thereafter issued a legal demand notice on 04.06.2014 which
was duly served on the accused. Despite service, the accused failed to repay
the cheque amount within the stipulated period and hence, the present
complaint.
APPEARANCE OF ACCUSED AND TRIAL
3\. On finding a prima facie case against the accused, he was summoned to face
trial and after his appearance, notice of accusation under Section 251 Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as "CrPC") was framed
against the accused. In reply to the notice of accusation, the accused pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. He further stated:-
"The complainant had purchased a flat in collaboration for which he had paid
Rs.10,00,000/-. However, the transaction could not be materialized and hence,
I had given the cheque in question in blank signed condition to my brother. I
am still ready and willing to give possession of the flat to the complainant
on payment of remaining consideration amount by the complainant."
4\. The accused sought time to file an application under section 145(2) in
order to cross examine the complainant. The Ld. predecessor of this Hon'ble
court vide order dated 17.01.2020 closed the right of the accused to cross
examine the complainant as numerous opportunities were provided to the accused
and the matter was pending for filing of application under section 145(2) NI
Act since March 2015. The application under section 145 (2) NI Act was filed
on 06.03.2020 and the court was informed that the order dated 17.01.2020 is
being challenged. The Ld. ASJ (Central), Tis Hazari Court, Delhi set aside the
order dated 17.01.2020 in Cr.No.130/2020 vide order dated 21.10.2020 and
allowed the accused to cross-examine the complainant for the fair trial.
5\. During the trial, the complainant has led the following oral and
documentary evidence against the accused to prove her case beyond reasonable
doubt-:
ORAL EVIDENCE:-

    CC No. 530966/2017          Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal              page 3 of 15
           DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:-
          Ex. CW1/1          :        Agreement to sell dated 02.01.2013
          Ex. CW1/2          :        Receipts dated 01.01.2013 and 18.03.2013
          Ex. CW1/3          :        Cheque dated 05.03.2014 and Return memo
                                      dated 26.05.2014
          Ex. CW1/4          :        Legal Demand Notice dated 04.06.2014
          Ex. CW1/5 & 6      :        Postal Receipts
          Ex. CW1/A          :        Pre-Summoning Evidence by way of affidavit
                                      of complainant
6\. Thereafter, before the start of defence evidence, in order to allow the
accused to personally explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in
evidence against it, the statement of the accused was recorded without oath
under Section 313 CrPC. In reply, the accused stated that he issued a blank
signed cheque to the complainant. He denies the receipt of the legal notice.
Further, he stated, as under: "I do not owe anything to the complainant and I
have already made the payment. I have been falsely implicated by the
complainant."
Pursuant thereto, the accused has led the following oral evidence in its
defence-:
ORAL EVIDENCE:-
DW 1 : Mr. Ravinder Mittal (Accused)
7\. The final arguments were heard via video conferencing. I have heard the
Ld. counsel appearing for the parties and have given my thoughtful
consideration to the material appearing on record.
ARGUMENTS
8\. It has been argued by the Ld. counsel for the complainant that all the
ingredients of the offence are fulfilled in the present case and the
complainant has duly proved her case. The Ld. Counsel for the complainant
submitted that once the signature on the cheque in question is admitted by the
accused, a presumption of a legally CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder
Mittal page 4 of 15 enforceable debt has arisen in favour of the complainant
and now it is for the accused to rebut the said presumption. He has placed
reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, Rangappa v. Sri Mohan 2010
(3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 164, wherein the court has observed as under, "This
court held that once issuance of a cheque and signature hereon are admitted,
presumption of a legally enforceable debt in favour of the holder of the
cheque arises. It is for the accused to rebut the said presumption, though
accused need not adduce his own evidence and can rely upon the material
submitted by the complainant. However, mere statement of the accused may not
be sufficient to rebut the said presumption. A post-dated cheque is a well-
recognized mode of payment."
9\. The Ld. Counsel for the complainant further argued that the accused has
taken contradictory stands at different stages of the trial. Firstly, the
accused in his notice under section 251 Cr.P.C. and in application filed under
section 145(2) NI Act has stated that the complainant had paid Rs.10 lakhs to
the accused. However, the accused in his statement under section 313 and also
in his defence evidence stated that he received only Rs. 5 lakhs. The Ld.
Counsel for the complainant has placed on record the judgment of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court, Jaspal Singh v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) & Anr. 2016 X
AD (Delhi) 274 Crl. Rev. P. No.160/2016, wherein the findings of the court
were affirmed on the ground that defence taken by the accused for issuance of
cheques was conflicting and the accused was unable to rebut the presumption on
the basis of the material available on record or the defence evidence.
10\. The Ld. counsel for the complainant further submitted that the plea of
the accused that he has returned the amount to the complainant has not been
substantiated by any document. He further submitted that the accused has
neither filed any receipt to support his plea nor he has shown that he
demanded the blank signed cheque back from the complainant. Reliance has been
placed on the case of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Virender Soni v. The
State of NCT of Delhi 2017 (2) ICC (NI)106, wherein the findings of the trial
court was affirmed on the ground that the accused failed to place on record
any document, whatsoever regarding the taking of loan and its return alongwith
interest. The court observed that nothing has come on record if the accused
had ever demanded the blank cheque allegedly issued by him CC No. 530966/2017
Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 5 of 15 at the time of the repayment of the
loan. Thus, the judgment of the trial court regarding the conviction of the
accused was upheld.
11\. The Ld. Counsel for the complainant submitted that the contention of the
accused that he did not receive the legal notice does not hold good. It is
submitted that the accused made his appearance on issuance of summons which
was served on the same address on which the legal notice was sent, hence the
legal notice was validly served. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Manoj Jain v. Surinder Kumar Jain & Anr. 2015 (3)
JCC (NI) 212, wherein the Court observed as under:
"14. The assertion of the Petitioner that the demand notice was not received
by him as it was sent on a wrong address. The summons by the court which were
also sent at the same address, were received by him. The notice which was sent
by UPC did not return, indicating that it was served. Thus, both the courts
below rightly held that notice was validly served."
12\. The Ld. Counsel for the complainant submitted that the accused has not
been able to lead cogent evidence that he has repaid the amount to the
complainant and that there was no legally recoverable debt in favour of the
complainant. The Ld. Counsel for the Complainant has placed on record the
judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court of Avdesh Gupta Vs' Satish Sharma &
Anr' Criminal Revision Petition No'102/2016 judgment delivered on 02.04.2018
to substantiate the argument.
13\. As such, the Ld. Counsel for the complainant prays that the accused be
convicted for the offence under section 138 of NI Act.
14\. Per contra, the Ld. Counsel for the accused argued that the complainant
and the accused met each other via common friend, however, the complainant has
not called such friend as a witness. He further argued that the part payment
which has been received by one person, namely, A.K. Aggarwal has also not been
called as a witness on behalf of the complainant. The Ld. Counsel for the
accused submitted that the complainant has deliberately not called these
witnesses as it will lead to the unfolding of the truth.
15\. The Ld. Counsel for the accused further submits that no legal notice was
ever received by the accused and that the complainant has not placed any
evidence of delivery of legal notice on record. He also argued that the
complainant issued the cheque for an amount more CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg
v. Ravinder Mittal page 6 of 15 than the liability, i.e., the complainant
issued a cheque for an amount of Rs.12,50,000/- however, the complainant has
failed to give any evidence regarding the said amount. He has placed on record
the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, Lyca Finance Ltd. vs. State &
Anr. Cr.L.P. 251/2013 decided on 15.07.2016.
16\. The Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the complainant does not
have the financial capacity to pay the amount to the accused. He further
submitted that the complainant has not shown any proof of income despite
repeated demands and has not produced ITR in the court. The Ld. Counsel for
the accused further argues that advancing of cash loan of more than
Rs.20,000/- is punishable under section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and
the complainant shall be liable under the said provision. Reliance was placed
on the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in S.K. Jain, Sneh Jain v.
Vijay Kalra Cri. A. 1011 of 2013 decided on 06.03.2014.
17\. As such, it is prayed that the accused be acquitted for the offence
punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
INGREDIENTS OF OFFENCE AND DISCUSSION-
18\. Before dwelling into the facts of the present case, it would be apposite
to discuss the legal standards required to be met by both sides. In order to
establish the offence under Section 138 of NI Act, the prosecution must fulfil
all the essential ingredients of the offence. Perusal of the bare provision
reveals the following necessary ingredients of the offence:-
First Ingredient: The cheque was drawn by a person on an account maintained by
him for payment of money and the same is presented for payment within a period
of 3 months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its
validity;
Second Ingredient: The cheque was drawn by the drawer for discharge of any
legally enforceable debt or other liability; Third Ingredient: The cheque was
returned unpaid by the bank due to either insufficiency of funds in the
account to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid
from that account on an agreement made with that bank;
CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 7 of 15 Fourth
Ingredient: A demand of the said amount has been made by the payee or holder
in due course of the cheque by a notice in writing given to the drawer within
thirty days of the receipt of information of the dishonour of cheque from the
bank;
Fifth Ingredient: The drawer fails to make payment of the said amount of money
within fifteen days from the date of receipt of notice.
APPRECIATION OF EVIDENCE
19\. The accused can only be held guilty of the offence under Section 138 NI
Act if the above-mentioned ingredients are proved by the complainant co-
extensively. Additionally, the conditions stipulated under Section 142 NI Act
have to be fulfilled.
20\. Notably, there is no dispute at bar about the proof of first, third, and
fifth ingredient. The complainant has proved the original cheque, Ex. CW1/3
which the accused has not disputed as being drawn on the account of the
accused. It is not disputed that the cheque in question was presented within
its validity period. The cheque in question was returned unpaid vide return
memo Ex. CW1/3 due to the reason, "stop payment by drawee". It is further
admitted by the accused in his statement under section 313 Cr.P.C. that he
stopped the payment as there was not sufficient money in his account. As such,
on the basis of the above, the first, third and fifth ingredient of the
offence under Section 138 NI Act stands proved against the accused.
21\. As far as the proof of second ingredient is concerned, the complainant
has to prove that the cheque in question was drawn by the drawer for
discharging a legally enforceable debt. In the present case, the issuance of
the cheque in question is not denied. As per the scheme of the NI Act, once
the accused admits signature on the cheque in question, certain presumptions
are drawn, which result in shifting of onus. Section 118(a) of the NI Act lays
down the presumption that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for
consideration. Another presumption is enumerated in Section 139 of NI Act. The
provision lays down the presumption that the holder of the cheque received it
for the discharge, in whole or part, of any debt or other liability.
22\. The combined effect of these two provisions is a presumption that the
cheque was drawn for consideration and given by the accused for the discharge
of debt or other liability. Both the sections use the expression CC No.
530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 8 of 15 "shall", which makes it
imperative for the court to raise the presumptions, once the foundational
facts required for the same are proved {Refer Hiten P. Dalal vs. Bratindranath
Banerjee (2001) 6 SCC 16}.
23\. Further, it has been held by a three-judge bench of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan (2010) 11 SCC 441 that the
presumption contemplated under Section 139 of NI Act includes the presumption
of existence of a legally enforceable debt. Once the presumption is raised, it
is for the accused to rebut the same by establishing a probable defence. The
principles pertaining to the presumptions and the onus of proof were recently
summarized by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Basalingappa vs. Mudibasappa (2019) 5
SCC 418 as under:
"25. We having noticed the ratio laid down by this Court in the above cases on
Section 118(a) and 139, we now summarise the principles enumerated by this
Court in the following manner:
25.1. Once the execution of cheque is admitted Section 139 of the Act mandates
a presumption that the cheque was for the discharge of any debt or other
liability.
25.2. The presumption under Section 139 is a rebuttable presumption and the
onus is on the accused to raise probable defence. The standard of proof for
rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities.
25.3. To rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on evidence
led by him or the accused can also rely on the materials submitted by the
complainant in order to raise a probable defence. Inference of preponderance
of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials brought on record by
the parties but also by reference to the circumstances upon which they rely.
25.4. That it is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box in
support of his defence. Section 139 imposed an evidentiary burden and not a
persuasive burden.
25.5. It is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box to
support his defence."
24\. The presumptions raised under Section 118(b) and Section 139 NI Act are
rebuttable presumptions. A reverse onus is cast on the accused, CC No.
530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 9 of 15 who has to establish a
probable defence on the standard of preponderance of probabilities to prove
that either there was no legally enforceable debt or other liability. In this
case, the arguments raised by the ld. counsel for the accused to rebut the
presumption are discussed below:
I. DEFENCE OF SECURITY CHEQUE It is submitted by the Ld. Counsel for the
accused that the accused had given a blank signed cheque to the complainant
for the purpose of security and not for the discharge of any legal liability.
The Ld. Counsel for the complainant has rebutted the said contention and has
argued that the cheque in question was issued in discharge of the legal
liability as the accused was liable to return the amount, which was paid by
the complainant as part payment of the sale consideration with regard to the
said property.
In the present case, the accused has admitted in the notice under Section 251
Cr.P.C. that the cheques in question bear his signatures. Reference can be
made to judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Rangappa v. Mohan [AIR 2010 SC
1898], that, "Once the cheque relates to the account of the accused and he
accepts and admits the signatures on the said cheque, then initial presumption
as contemplated under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has to be
raised by the Court in favour of the complainant." It implies that in the
present case the onus is upon the accused to rebut the presumption raised
under Sections 118(a) and 139 of the said Act and merely saying that the
cheques in question were given by him to the complainant as security is not
sufficient to rebut the presumption. In the instant case, the accused has
appeared as DW1 and has taken the defence that the cheques in question were
given to the complainant in lieu of the part payment of the sum of Rs. 5 lakhs
made by the complainant. However, the accused has neither led any cogent
evidence to show that the said amount was returned to the complainant nor has
brought on record any evidence that he demanded the said blank signed cheque
from the complainant. Per contra, the complainant has placed on record the
receipts vide Ex. CW1/2 which bears the signature of the accused to show that
the accused received a sum of amount of Rs. 10 lakhs as part of the part
payment and the same has not been rebutted by the accused that the said
document does not bear the signature of the accused. Thus, besides the
presumption raised under the provisions of the NI Act, the complainant has
placed sufficient evidence on record to prove that the accused has a legal
liability to pay to the complainant. Thus, the plea of the accused that the
cheque in question was given as a security cheque does not hold good.
    CC No. 530966/2017           Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal            page 10 of 15
        II.      DEFENCE OF NON-RECEIPT OF LEGAL NOTICE
It is contended by the Ld. Counsel for the accused that the accused has not
received legal notice and no tracking report has been filed to prove as to
whether any legal notice has been delivered or not. However, the accused
appeared on issuance of summons which was served upon the same address on
which the legal notice was sent. Relying upon the judgment of Honble' High
Court of Delhi, Manoj Jain v. Surinder Kumar Jain & Anr. (supra) cited by the
Ld. Counsel for the complainant, it can be said that the legal notice was
validly served. The complainant has placed on record legal notice dated
04.06.2014 vide Ex. CW1/4 and postal receipts Ex. CW1/5 & 6\. Thus, the
receipt of legal notice is presumed. The fact that the payment was not made
within 15 days of the receipt of the legal notice is.
Admittedly, the delivery report of the legal demand notice has not been placed
on record, however, it is nobody's case that the accused tendered the amount
entailed in the impugned cheque upon entering appearance before this court in
response to the summons issued in the instant case. At this stage, a reliance
be placed upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CC.
Alavi Haji v. Palalpetty Muhammed & Anr. (2007) 6 SCC 555, wherein it was
observed as under, "It is also to be borne in mind that the requirement of
giving of notice is a clear departure from the rule of Criminal Law, where
there is no stipulation of giving of a notice before filing a complaint. Any
drawer who claims that he did not receive the notice sent by post, can, within
15 days of receipt of summons from the court in respect of the complaint under
Section 138 of the Act, make payment of the cheque amount and submit to the
Court that he had made payment within 15 days of receipt of summons (by
receiving a copy of complaint with the summons) and, therefore, the complaint
is liable to be rejected. A person who does not pay within 15 days of receipt
of the summons from the Court along with the copy of the complaint under
Section 138 of the Act, cannot obviously contend that there was no proper
service of notice as required under Section 138, by ignoring statutory
presumption to the contrary under Section 27 of the G.C. Act and Section 114
of the Evidence Act. In our view, any other interpretation of the proviso
would defeat the very object of the legislation."
The plea of the accused regarding the non-receipt of the legal notice is
accordingly rejected as being frivolous and inconsequential. Consequently, the
fourth ingredient of the offence under section 138 of NI Act is proved.
CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal page 11 of 15 III. DEFENCE
THAT THE ALLEGED LIABILITY OF THE ACCUSED IS LESS THAN THE CHEQUE AMOUNT The
Ld. Counsel for the accused has argued that the complainant has demanded
amount more than the alleged liability of the accused and thus, the case shall
be dismissed as the same is not maintainable. He further argued that the
complainant has not produced any document to substantiate as to how the said
amount is due.
It may be noted that the complainant has placed on record an agreement to sell
dated 02.01.2013 vide Ex. CW-1/1 wherein it was stipulated that the sale
consideration for the said property was Rs.28,70,000/- out of which a sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- had been received as the earnest money by the first party. The
receipt dated 01.01.2013 vide Ex. CW-1/2 has also been placed on record where
the accused has signed the said receipt as a witness. The complainant has
placed on record another receipt dated 18.03.2013 wherein a payment of Rs.5
lakhs had been received by the accused and it also mentioned the receiving of
the total amount (including the earnest money) which had been paid to the
accused till that date. It is pertinent to note that the complainant in his
legal notice vide Ex. CW1/4 had clearly stated the alleged amount alongwith
the interest which is payable by the accused to the complainant. The
complainant in his cross-examination has stated that the cheque amount
includes the amount which payable by the accused alongwith the interest as the
sale transaction could not be concluded as the said building was sealed by the
MCD.
In the light of the documentary evidence submitted by the complainant, the
accused has failed to rebut the presumption regarding the amount for which the
cheque was issued. The judgment Lyca Finance Ltd. vs. State & Anr (supra)
relied upon by the Ld. Counsel for the accused is not relevant to the facts of
the present case. Hence, the plea of the accused regarding the cheque amount
more than the liability does not hold good.
IV. DEFENCE OF QUESTIONING THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY OF THE COMPLAINANT The Ld.
Counsel for the accused has contended that the complainant did not have any
financial capacity to pay the alleged amount to the accused. Further, it has
been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Basalingappa vs. Mudibasappa (2019)
5 SCC 418 that when the financial capacity of the complainant is questioned by
the accused, then complainant is bound to CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg v.
Ravinder Mittal page 12 of 15 explain the same. In case the complainant is
unable to reasonably explain the source, then presumption u/s 139 can be said
to have been rebutted. In the present case, the complainant in her cross-
examination has stated that that the alleged amount was paid from the savings
of the complainant. The presumption under section 139 of the Act cannot be
rebutted merely on the ground that the complainant has not shown the
transaction in ITR. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case of Sheela
Sharma v. Mahendra Pal, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4696 observed as under, "In cases
where the complainant claims to have advanced a friendly loan in cash, and
where the transaction of loan is not evidenced by any other documentary or
other reliable evidence, no doubt, the aspect whether the availability of
funds in cash with the complainant/lender, and its advancement as loan to the
accused have been reflected in the income tax returns of the
complainant/lender, or not, become relevant. If, the availability of funds,
and the loan transaction itself is not so reflected, that factor is taken note
of by the Court as relevant to hold that the presumption under Section 118 and
139 of the NI Act stands rebutted. However, these considerations would not be
relevant, where loan transaction itself is otherwise established, either
through documentary evidence-such as, a receipt or a loan agreement, or
acknowledgement executed by the accused, or by oral evidence of an independent
witness who is found to be credible."
In the present case, the transaction even if it is not reflected in ITR has
been established by other mode of evidence i.e. receipts vide Ex. CW1/ 2 shows
that the accused had received the payment as earnest money along with part
payment in furtherance of the amount to be paid as part of the sale
consideration. The complainant has stated that the said amount has been shown
in the ITR, however, the same has not been brought on record. It is pertinent
to note that the Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Shrimati
Ragini Gupta Vs. Piyush Dutt Sharma CRR 5263/2018 delivered on 07.03.2019, has
held that non-filing of ITR by itself would not mean that the complainant had
no source of income and thus, no adverse inference can be drawn in this regard
only because of absence of ITR. Thus, in the present case merely because the
ITR has not been brought on record, no adverse inference can be drawn as the
accused has not been able to rebut the presumption regarding the financial
capacity of the complainant.
       V.     DEFENCE THAT THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN                              THE
              COMPLAINANT AND THE ACCUSED IS NULL AND VOID
    CC No. 530966/2017         Pooja Garg v. Ravinder Mittal            page 13 of 15
The Ld. Counsel for the accused argued that amount more than Rs. 20,000/-
cannot be advanced in the form of cash and that the same is punishable under
section 269SS of the Income Tax Act,1961.
In the present case, the complainant advanced the alleged amount which is more
than Rs.20,000/-. However, it is a well settled law that the breach of Section
269 SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961 does not make such a transaction null &
void {Refer Sheela Sharma v. Mahendra Pal, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4696; Dilip
Chawla v. Ravinder Kumar, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 9753}. To further substantiate,
the penalty for breach of Section 269 SS of the Income Tax Act is provided
under Section 271D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which does not provide that
such a transaction would be null and void. Thus, it is clear that the
proceedings under NI Act will not be affected by the breach of the said
provision.
CONCLUSION
25\. To recapitulate the above discussion, the complainant has been successful
in establishing her case beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had issued
the cheque in question in discharge of its legally enforceable liability. The
presumptions under Section 118 and Section 139 of NI Act were drawn against
the accused firm. The accused has miserably failed to rebut the said
presumption by raising a probable defence. The defence has not been able to
prove that there was no legal liability upon the accused, even on the standard
of preponderance of probabilities. Further, solely the testimony of the
accused cannot be relied upon as he has taken contradictory stands at
different stages of trial. Firstly, at the time of framing of notice and under
application under section 145(2) NI Act, he has stated that the complainant
had paid Rs. 10 lakhs to the accused. While, under section 313 CrPC and in his
cross-examination, he has stated that he had received only Rs. 5 lakhs from
the complainant as part payment. Thus, relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble
High Court of Delhi, Jaspal Singh v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) & Anr.
(supra) cited by the Ld. Counsel for the complainant, it can be said that the
accused has taken contradictory stands at different stages and thus, unable to
rebut the presumption raised in favour of the complainant. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat (2012) 13 SCC 375,
wherein it has been held as under, "Therefore, if the accused is able to
establish a probable defence which creates doubt about the existence of a
legally enforceable debt or liability, the prosecution can fail. The accused
can rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in order to raise such
a defence and it is inconceivable that in CC No. 530966/2017 Pooja Garg v.
Ravinder Mittal page 14 of 15 some cases the accused may not need to adduce
the evidence of his/her own. If however, the accused/drawer of a cheque in
question neither raises a probable defence nor able to contest existence of a
legally enforceable debt or liability, obviously statutory presumption under
Section 139 of the NI Act regarding commission of the offence comes into play
if the same is not rebutted with regard to the materials submitted by the
complainant...."
26\. Resultantly, the compliant of the complainant Ms. Pooja Garg is allowed
and the accused Mr. Ravinder Mittal is hereby convicted of the offence under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Let the accused be heard
separately on quantum of sentence. A copy of this judgment be given free of
cost to the convict.
