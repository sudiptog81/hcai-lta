CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. HARI SHANKAR % JUDGMENT
that, having W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 60 of 61 uninterruptedly served the
petitioner, solely and to the exclusion of all others, for 14 years, even
without any artificial break, the decision of the petitionerto summarily
terminate its relationship with Respondent No.2, by refusing to review the
agreement between them beyond 30 th April, 2012, amounts to ―retrenchment‖,
within the meaning of Section 25-F of the ID Act, read with Section 3 of the
Working Journalists Act. The said termination of employment has, therefore, to
be characterised as illegal, and the learned Labour Court cannot be said to
have fallen into error in so holding.
70\. I was of the view that, possibly, an amicable resolution, to the
controversy, could be achieved, for which purpose the parties were referred to
mediation. However, the said efforts proved futile.
71\. As a result, this Court has no option but to uphold the impugned Award of
the learned Labour Court in toto.
72\. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed.
73\. This judgment shall not, however, preclude the petitioner and Respondent
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. HARI SHANKAR % JUDGMENT

& Co KG, a company incorporated in Germany, assails an award, dated 3rd

26th June, 2013, issued by the Deputy Labour Commissioner, Government of

W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 1 of 61
> ―Whether the action of management, terminating the services of worklady, Ms
> Padma Rao, D/o late Dr V. V.
S. K. Rao w.e.f. 30/4/2012 by not renewing the contract agreement dated
1/5/1998 is legal and justified; and if no, to what relief is she entitled and
what directions are necessary in this respect?.‖ The Impugned Award
3\. The facts of the case, as set out in the Statement of Claim filed by
Respondent No. 2,Ms. Padma Rao, before the Labour Court, may be set out thus:
> (i) The following agreement was entered into, between the Petitionerand
> Respondent No. 2, on9th April, 1998:
> ―Dear Ms. Rao, We are pleased to confirm the following agreement with you:
> 1\. With effect of May 1, 1998, you will be a freelance employee of the
> SPIEGEL Publishers, Hamburg and will be based in New Delhi;
> 2\. Your duties will be along the lines specified by us in our discussion;
> (reportage and other writing for SPIEGEL Publishers);
> 3\. You will receive a monthly retainer of the Deutschmark 6000, which will

> Personnel Department‖
> (ii) Consequent upon, and following on, the above agreement dated 9th April,
> 1998, Respondent No. 2 rendered services, for the petitioner, till April
> 2012. During this entire period, from 1998 till April, 2012, the above
> agreement/contract, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, was renewed
> on year-to-year basis. However, the agreement was not renewed beyond April
> 2012\. As a result, the relationship between the petitionerand Respondent
> No. 2 came to an end on 30th April, 2012.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 3 of 61
> (iii) Before the Labour Court, Respondent No. 2 sought to contend that the
> above agreement, dated 9th April, 1998, though styled as a ―freelance
> employee‖ contract, was actually a permanent contract of employment, in
> support of which contention, Respondent No. 2 drew attention to the fact
> that (i) Respondent No. 2 used to report directly to the petitionerat
> Hamburg, (ii) the salary of Respondent No. 2 was paid by the Hamburg office
> of the petitioner, (iii) the duty timings of Respondent No. 2 were
> determined by the Hamburg office of the petitioner, (iv) Respondent No. 2
> also used to vote in the elections held for the ―Employee's Advisory
> Council‖, like all other permanent employees of the petitioner, (v)
> permission was required to be obtained, from the Hamburg office of the
> petitioner, for Respondent No. 2 to travel and (vi) permission was also
> needed, from the Hamburg office of the petitioner, for Respondent No. 2 to
> avail leave. Respondent No. 2 further contended that, though the
> petitionertreated her as a permanent employee while extracting work from
> her, she was not paid all the emoluments and perks given to permanent
> employees. This, she sought to contend, amounted to an unfair labour
> practice.
> (iv) In December 2011, Respondent No. 2 filed a suit in the Labour Court at
> Hamburg, for declaration of her status as a permanent employee of the
> petitioner. Vide order dated 30th October, 2012, the Labour Court at Hamburg
> dismissed the claim of Respondent No. 2 as ―not admissible‖, holding that
> there was ―no legitimate interest to take legal action as regards W.P.(C)
> 1841/2018 Page 4 of 61 the present action.‖ Nevertheless, the Labour Court
> granted monetary benefits/compensation to Respondent No. 2.
> (v) The refusal, of the petitioner, to extend the contractual agreement,
> between Respondent No. 2 and itself, beyond April, 2012 was, it was alleged
> by Respondent No. 2, retaliatory in nature, in view of the award of the
> Labour Court at Hamburg, referred to hereinabove.
> (vi) In September 2012, the petitionersent a permanent staffer to Delhi to
> assume Indian operations.
> (vii) A legal notice, dated 28th January, 2013, was sent, by Respondent No.
> 2 to the petitioner, seeking extension of the contract between the
> petitionerand Respondent No. 2 and conferment of permanent status on her.
> The said legal notice failed to meet with any positive response from the
> petitioner, Respondent No. 2 approached the conciliation officer, for
> initiation of conciliation proceedings under Section 10 (2) of the
> Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as ―the ID Act‖) read
> with the provisions of the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service and
> Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as ―the Working
> Journalists Act‖). The matter was referred to conciliation.
> (viii) Consequent on failure of the attempts at conciliation, Respondent No.
> 2 raised an industrial dispute, praying for W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 5 of 61
> reinstatement in service with full back wages. The said dispute was referred
> to the Labour Court, and adjudicated vide the impugned Award dated 3rd
> November, 2017.
4\. In its written statement, filed by the petitioner, by way of response to
the Statement of Claim of Respondent No. 2 before the Labour Court, it was
contended thus:
> (i) There was no employer-employee relationship between the petitionerand
> Respondent No. 2. Respondent No. 2 was employed as a ―freelancer‖, vide the
> agreement dated 9th April, 1998 supra.
> (ii) The agreement dated 9th April, 1998 supra envisaged only a fixed term
> contractual relationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2.
> (iii) Respondent No. 2 used to write articles for the ―Der Spiegel‖
> magazine, which were edited by the petitioner, and printed in Germany.
> However, the ―Der Spiegel‖ magazine was not a ―newspaper‖, within the
> meaning of Section 2(b) of the Working Journalists Act. As such, there could
> be no ―industrial dispute‖, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2,
> within the meaning of the expression as defined in clause (k) of Section 2
> of the ID Act.
5\. Rejoinder was filed, by Respondent No. 2, before the Labour Court.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 6 of 61
6\. The Labour Court framed the following issues, as arising for its
consideration:
> ―1. Whether the claim of the claimant is barred by res judicata as the issue
> in this case has already been decided by the competent court? OPM.
> 2\. Whether there exists relationship of employer- employee between the
> claimant and the management? OPW
> 3\. As per terms of reference. OPW
> 4\. Relief.‖
7\. Before the Labour Court, Respondent No. 2 examined herself as WW-1 and
Sudhir Mohan Verma, a chartered accountant, as WW-
2.No other defence witness was cited. She also produced, in her support,
documents, which were exhibited as Ex. CW-1/A to CW-1/H.
8\. In her affidavit-in-evidence, Respondent No. 2, testifying as WW-1,
deposed that, vide agreement dated 1st May, 1998, she was appointed as South
Asia correspondent for ―Der Spiegel‖, a news magazine published by the
petitioner, and that, since then, she had continuously and uninterruptedly
rendered services till April, 2012, in the process having worked for 5110 days
(14 years). This, she contended in her affidavit-in-evidence, entitled her to
be regularised, in terms of the ID Act. She also alleged that, having worked
for the petitionerfor 14 long years, her contract was not renewed only because
she had chosen to approach the Labour Court at Hamburg.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 7 of 61
9\. Respondent No. 2 further deposed that, in September 2012, ―a new
correspondent, a fully paid German National on a permanent contract, was
posted in New Delhi in the same position‖ as had been held by her. Respondent
No. 2 further deposed thus:
> ―15. I state that when I was in employment in the year 1998, I was being
> paid DM 4000/-, as gross emoluments. In addition, I was being paid DM 2000/-
> as a house rent allowance for residence-cum-office.
> 16\. I state that the Respondent insisted that I must maintain an office-
> come-residence - so that the time difference between Hamburg and New Delhi
> does not disadvantage reporting topical news and breaking stories.
> 17\. I state that though the Agreement dated 1st May, 1998 is styled as a
> ‗freelance employee' contract, was in essence a permanent Employee Contract
> clearly stipulating my duties and responsibilities vis-à-vis writing and
> reporting.
> 18\. I state that though I was assured on numerous occasions that I would be
> conferred the status of permanent employee in due course as the nature of my
> duties and responsibilities were that of permanent employee. However, on one
> pretext or another, the respondents kept delaying the process of making me
> permanent employee and deceitfully and designedly kept me on annual contract
> for 14 (fourteen) long years. Thus, depriving me of my legitimate dues for
> all these years.
> 19\. I state that the permanent nature of the contract can be safely deduced
> and inferred from the fact that the entire intellectual property rights
> (IPR) i.e. copyright over the written original work has been retained,
> without my authorisation by M/s Spiegel-Verlag (Spiegel Publishers).
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 8 of 61
> 20\. I state that for all these 14 years and like all other permanent
> employees of M/s Spiegel-Verlag (Spiegel Publishers), I was always allowed
> to vote in the yearly elections to the employee's advisory council/union
> elections (―Betriebsrat‖). I state that the purpose of this union is to
> negotiate with the personnel department on behalf of employees. I would
> receive voting slip every year to cast my vote. Throughout these 14 years, I
> also held the German press card issued by the Association of German Magazine
> Publishers North e.V.
> 21\. I state that I was directly reporting to M/s Spiegel- Verlag in Hamburg
> (Germany), my salary came from Hamburg as did that of my staff, my official
> day began at Hamburg time (12.30 or 13.30 IST) and carried on as long as
> Hamburg HQ was open.
> 22\. I further state that the Contract and all the continuous renewal were
> drawn in Hamburg; to run or not to run my stories was decided in Hamburg, to
> travel in connection with the work, permission from Hamburg was required, to
> take a vacation, our client needed permission from Hamburg. Innutshellfor
> all purposes the I was a permanent employee of M/s. Spiegel-Verlag. I
> reported only and solely to the Senior Foreign Editor of the Spiegel
> published by the Newspaper Establishment - M/s Spiegel-Verlag. Documents
> evidencing permanent nature of the employment are exhibited as Exhibited.
> CW-1/C1 to C... (Pages 128 to 180 of the claim Petition).‖
10\. Respondent No. 2 further averred, in her affidavit-in-evidence, that she
―was always considered as a permanent employee while taking work, but treated
as contractual while paying for the work.‖ It was further averred, in the said
affidavit-in-evidence, that ―the reason W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 9 of 61 for
non-renewal given in February 2012 by telephone and again in July 2012 via
email from Senior Foreign Editor was that due to financial constraints, M/s
Spiegel-Verlag is closing down India operations‖, but that, in September 2012,
the petitionersent a permanent staffer to New Delhi to resume Indian
operations.‖
11\. Respondent No. 2 was cross-examined by the petitioner. She reiterated, in
the cross-examination, that ―regularisation did not happen between 1998-2012
although it was promised verbally‖ acknowledging that ―thus, in the absence of
(her) regularisation, during the period 1998-2012 (she) continued as a
contractual employee.‖
12\. Regarding the premises at Golf Links, which she was occupying during her
14-year tenure, Respondent No. 2 submitted, in cross-examination, thus:
> ―Spiegel asked me in the verbal discussion around April 98 to set up an
> office cum residence so that journalistic work does not suffer due to time
> difference. The 1st address was 91 Golf Links and 2nd was 101 Golf Links,
> New Delhi. These 2 addresses were taken on lease. The lessee was myself.
> Vol. But the lease had to be signed and stamped by Der Spiegel in Hamburg
> and money is transferred by them to the landlord. I can produce the lease
> deeds. The Der Spiegel was transferring the monthly lease rentals to the
> landlord by the electronic transfer. Apart from me there was a Researcher,
> peon, driver and other cleaning staff at these offices. Apart from me
> Spiegel had contract with the researcher however, no contract was there with
> peon, driver and other cleaning staff. While the researcher was paid by
> Spiegel, the other stuff was paid from office expenses W.P.(C) 1841/2018
> Page 10 of 61 account. In the relevant period I had two bank accounts. In
> one account I used to receive my retainer salary and office expenses were
> received in other account. The money received as expenses was on fixed and
> was not actuals. The researcher was handling the office accounts and used to
> send a monthly statements to headquarter. If in a given month the actual
> office expenditure was less than the money transferred in the beginning of
> month for running the office, the excess would be carried forward for the
> next month. Although typical I will receive the same fixed amount next
> month. I have filed my tax returns throughout the period 1998-12. Although I
> need to check, the tax filings the money received from Spiegel has been
> shown as retainer/salary in my tax returns. I can place my tax return for
> the relevant period. I was supervising the work of the staff in the office.
> I had the ability to hire new staff and fire the existing staff. Vol. Only
> after seeking permission from Hamburg. It would be right to say that I was
> representative of Spiegel in south Asia/India during the relevant period....
> Typically on every day during the relevant period I would read the Indian
> newspapers and would send a email containing story ideas in time for the
> editorial meeting in Hamburg. The Hamburg office will then decide which of
> my suggestions they want written as a story and then they would give me the
> instructions to do so. I would then research and interview and then write a
> story by the end of the week. My story was edited, discussed with me over
> phone, facts checked and published. ... For any travel outside Delhi I would
> need permission of Hamburg office and expenses would be reimbursed to be
> additionally after I had borne them in the first instance. I did not have
> the freedom to decide the amount of salary payable to staff without
> clearance of Hamburg. ‖
13\. In further cross-examination, Respondent No. 2 denied the suggestion that
she did not have to take permission from the petitionerbefore hiring or firing
of the staff, as well as the suggestion W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 11 of 61 that
she had freedom to decide the salary to be paid to them. She reiterated that
she needed the permission of the petitionerbefore fixing the salary of the
staff. She further emphasised that the maintaining of office-cum-residence was
a mandatory requirement for her job.
14\. WW-2 Sudhir Mohan Verma produced the income tax return, of Respondent No.
2, as evidence. The return was exhibited as Ex. CW-2/A. He further deposed
that the income of Respondent No. 2 was only from the petitioner, and that, as
the petitionerhad no place of business in India, it did not possess any
PAN/TAN Number. A perusal of the Income Tax return, filed by Respondent No. 2
reveals that she had declared the nature of her business or profession as
―author/writer‖, and had further stated that there had been no change in the
nature of a business/profession, and that she was maintaining cash/bank book
and ledger. It also revealed that Respondent No. 2 had declared the amount
received by her, from the petitioner, as ―professional receipts‖.
15\. In his affidavit-in-evidence tendered on behalf of the petitioner, MW-1
Vinod Sahni deposed that, under the Income Tax Act, 1961, an Indian resident,
earning salary from a foreign source, was required to declare the result and
income as ―salary‖, and not as ―income from business or profession‖.
16\. Having reconnoitered the evidence, the Labour Court returned the
following findings:
(i) Re. Issue 1:
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 12 of 61
The Labour Court at Hamburg had not returned any findings, but had dismissed
the petition of Respondent No. 2 as ―not admissible‖. In the absence of any
findings on merits, there could be no question of application of the principle
of res judicata. In fact, it was the submission of the petitioner, before the
Labour Court at Hamburg, that the petitionerof Respondent No. 2 was liable to
be dismissed, as Indian law applied to the agreement between Respondent No. 2
and the petitioner. This issue was, therefore, decided against the petitioner,
and in favour of Respondent No. 2.
(ii) Re. Issue 2:
The nature of employment is to be decided on the basis of the facts and
circumstances of the case and the service conditions governing the employee,
and not on the basis of the nomenclature attached to the employment. In view
of the fact that (a) Respondent No. 2 worked only for the petitioner, (b)
Respondent No. 2 was controlled by the petitioner, (c) Respondent No. 2 was
reporting to the petitioner, (d) during the currency of her employment with
the petitioner, Respondent No. 2 did not work for anyone else, and (e)
Respondent No. 2 served the petitionerfor 14 long years, all of which were
established and proved by Respondent No. 2 by evidence, in rebuttal whereof no
evidence was led by the petitioner, the W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 13 of 61
relationship of employer-employee, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2,
stood established. This issue was also, therefore, answered in favour of
Respondent No. 2, and against the petitioner.
(iii) Re. Issue 3
(a) The petitionerhad sought to contend that, as a contractual employee,
Respondent No. 2 could not maintain any claim for permanent retention in the
establishment of the petitioner. The services of Respondent No. 2, it was
sought to be contended, had come to an end on the expiry of the agreement
between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2. Legally, it was sought to be
submitted by the petitioner, a contractual employee could be terminated as per
the terms and conditions of the contract/agreement governing the relationship
between the employee and the person employing her. The Labour Court, however,
held that, as no evidence had been led by the petitioner, to substantiate its
claim that it had to close its Indian operations owing to financial problems,
the said claim could not be believed. Rather, it was observed, Respondent No.
2 had, in para 34 of her affidavit-in- evidence, specifically deposed that, in
September 2012, the petitionerhad sent a permanent staffer to India, to resume
Indian operations. Though Respondent No. 2 was cross-examined, at length, by
the petitioner, no W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 14 of 61 suggestion was put, to her,
regarding the said asseveration which, therefore, remained unrebutted and had,
therefore, to be taken as admitted.
(b) In Bhuvnesh Kumar Dwivedi v. Hindalco Industries Ltd, (2014) 11 SCC 85,
the Supreme Court had held that re-appointing employees repeatedly on the same
post, with artificial breaks, amounted to unfair labour practice. To the same
effect was the judgment of this Court inM/s Delhi Printing and Publishing Co.
Ltd. v. Labour Court-VII, 2002 SCC Online Del 1448. The situation, in the
present case, was better, in that, insofar as Respondent No. 2 was concerned,
she had worked for 14 years without any break. As the post was still in
existence, the petitionerhaving sent other staffers to man it, it was
established that the services of Respondent No. 2 had been illegally
terminated by the petitioner.
This issue was also, therefore, decided against the petitioner.
(iv) Re. Issue 4 As Respondent No. 2 had not averred that she had been
unemployed since the date of her termination, and had not led any evidence to
the said effect, she was not entitled to back wages.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 15 of 61
In the circumstances, the impugned Award of the Labour Court directed
reinstatement of Respondent No. 2 with all consequential benefits, but with no
back wages.
The Petitioner's challenge
17\. The petitionerhas sought to challenge the impugned Award of the Labour
Court on the following grounds:
> (i) The Labour Court erred in failing to consider that the contract between
> the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 clearly designated Respondent No. 2 as a
> ―freelance‖ employee of the petitioner. Even while averring, candidly, that
> ―the contract was admittedly extended 12 times on a year-on-year basis, and
> continued uninterruptedly for a period of 14 years‖, the petitionercontends
> that ―Respondent No. 2 was never treated as a permanent employee of the
> petitioner‖.
> (ii) Respondent No. 2 had admitted, in her cross- examination, that her
> regularisation had not taken place, during the period 1998 to 2012, though
> it was promised verbally and that, in the absence of such regularisation,
> during the said period, she continued as a contractual employee.
> (iii) Respondent No. 2 had also ―admitted, in her pleadings, that she ‗was
> assured on numerous occasions that she would be conferred the status of
> permanent employee in due course' and that Respondent No. 2 ‗was always
> considered as a permanent W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 16 of 61 employee while
> taking work, but treated as contractual while paying for the work.'‖ This,
> it is submitted (in Ground E in the writ petition) ―clearly evidences that
> both the parties recognised Respondent No. 2's status as a freelance
> employee of the petitionerand not as a permanent employee‖.
> (iv) The fact that Respondent No. 2 chose not to work for any other
> organisation, during the currency of her employment with the petitioner,
> even though there was no such prohibition imposed by the petitioner,
> contractually or otherwise, would not entitle Respondent No. 2 to claim the
> status of an employee, ―particularly when she had willingly endured the
> contractual extension for 12 years‖, which are recognised her as a
> freelancer.
> (v) The finding, of the learned Labour Court, to the effect that the
> petitionerwas controlling Respondent No. 2, was not supported by any
> material on record. Rather, the record indicated that the petitionerwas
> never exercising control, over Respondent No. 2, so as to give rise to an
> employer-employee relationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2.
> (vi) Respondent No. 2 had admitted, before the Hamburg Labour Court, that
> the contract, between the petitionerand her was, in Indian Law, a ―contract
> for personal service‖. There was a distinction between a ―contract for
> service‖ and ―contract of service‖. The following passages, from the
> response, on W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 17 of 61 behalf of Respondent No. 2, to
> the petitioners letter dated 17th August, 2012, submitted before the Hamburg
> Labour Court, were emphasised by Mr. Dewan in this context:
> ―It must be further noted, that one cannot speak of an office of the
> defendant to New Delhi, because the conditions stipulated by the Reserve
> Bank of India (RBI) Act for opening such an office - invisible form - were
> not fulfilled. According to this law, it is mandatory for foreign companies,
> which must feel they are active in - to get the permission of the RBI. This
> permission was never applied for by the defendant, because he himself did
> not regard the office-come-residence as an independent Spiegel office in
> India. Further and if the defendant wanted to set up an independent Spiegel-
> office in India, he would have had to additionally apply for the permission
> of India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This too, was never
> applied for/adhered to.
> It is therefore to be noted, that the defendant purposely avoided setting up
> a Spiegel-office in India and agreed to a personal office (office-come-
> residents) of the respondent, that our client only happens to be a foreign
> correspondent of Indian origin living in India, who contributes to a foreign
> media house and who has, for this journalistic purpose, set up an office-
> come-residence in her flat.
> It follows, therefore, that due to the lack of an independent Spiegel-office
> in India, this circumstance, too, speaks against the applicability of the
> Indian Law on this case. Further, it must be pointed out, that according to
> India's ‗Industrial Disputes Act' and due to the lack of the requisite
> permissions, the defendant had no presence of any kind in India, so that the
> disputed contract between the parties can, according to Indian Law, only be
> W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 18 of 61 described as a ‗Contract for Personal
> Services', for which - according to Indian Law - the Indian law is not
> applicable.‖
> (vii) The contract between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 was for a
> fixed period, and was made determinable without notice by either side,
> unless renewed or amended prior to expiry. There was, therefore, no ―element
> of permanency‖ in the engagement of Respondent No. 2 by the petitioner. My
> attention was invited, in this context, to Clause 6 of the

> No. 2, as reflected in her rejoinder, dated 3rd July, 2012, to the response,

W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 22 of 61
> This office was not a branch, this office is also not registered in India,
> that is, the SPIEGEL Publishers are not, in keeping with local law,

> ―Editorial Office 101 Golf Links, New Delhi‖ as well as Headquarters and
> Registration Court Hamburg HRA 617555 and Headquarters and Registration Code
> Hamburg HRB 13105.‖ All matters pertaining to the contract signed with the
> Plaintiff are also decided by the Headquarters of the SPIEGEL in Hamburg.
> This proves, that firstly, the Defendant had no official office/branch in
> New Delhi and secondly, that it describes the Plaintiff as its official
> representative in India. This circumstance therewith speaks for the

18\. Mr. Dewan placed reliance on the following decisions, in his support:
> (i) Ram Nayan Shukla v. District Basic Education Officer, 1999 SCC (L&S)
> 631;
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 24 of 61
> (ii) Amtt Yadav v. Delhi Vidyut Board 2000 SCC Online Del 73; and
> (iii) Vinod Pathak v. American Express Bank Ltd., 2015 SCC Online Del 12389.
19\. Arguing per contra, Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for Respondent No. 2 initially drew my attention to the limited scope of
interference, by Courts, exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, with awards of Labour Courts, submitting that
interference was warranted only in cases where the award was found to be
perverse. Reliance was placed, for this purpose, on the judgments in General
Manager, Oil and Natural Gas Commission Silchar v. Oil and Natural Gas
Commission contractual workers Union,(2008) 12 SCC 275 and Trambak Rubber
Industries v.Nashik Workers Union and Ors., (2003) 6 SCC 416.
20\. Mr. Tripathi also sought to discountenance the reliance, by Mr.Dewan, on
the proceedings before the Hamburg Labour Court, and the order, dated 30th
October, 2012, passed by the said Court as a consequence thereof. At worst,
submitted Mr. Tripathi, the said decision could amount to a pronouncement
that, under German law, there was no employer-employee relationship between
the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 and, even if there was, Respondent No. 2
was not entitled to any relief. Mr. Tripathi also sought to point out that the
decision of the Hamburg Labour Court was not enforceable at law in India. Mr.
Tripathi also pointed out, in this context, that, before the Hamburg Labour
Court, the petitionerhad W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 25 of 61 itself sought to
submit that Indian Law was applicable to the case, and had specifically
contended that ―the claims made by (the complainant) against the applicability
of Indian Law are not comprehensible‖. He also pointed out that, in the same
submissions, the petitioneradmitted that ―the defendant maintained an office
in New Delhi, India, in which the complainant worked‖, and that, though the
house was used both as a residence and office of Respondent No. 2, that was at
her own desire. The petitionerhad also admitted, in the said pleadings, that
―several other employees worked in this office who were paid by‖ it,
―particularly an office Assistant, first Raghu Varma till 2007 and since May
2008 Ms. Ekta Kapoor‖.
21\. The use of the word ―freelance‖, in the agreement/contract dated 9th
April, 1998 supra, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, Mr. Tripathi
would seek to submit, could not determine the juralrelationship between them.
It was the substance of the relationship that mattered, he would submit,
rather than the form thereof. Pointing out that Respondent No. 2 had worked,
for the petitioner, for as many as 5110 days, Mr. Tripathi sought to rely on
the paras, from the affidavit-in-evidence of Respondent No. 2, testifying as
WW-1 before the Labour Court, which already stands extracted in para 9
hereinabove.
22\. In this context, Mr. Tripathi also emphasised the fact that Respondent
No. 2 had been issued identity cards and media accreditation cards, showing
her as a journalist working with Der Spiegel. The fact of issuance of these
cards, though pleaded by W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 26 of 61 Respondent No. 2 had
not, it was pointed out, being repelled by the petitioner. In fact, submitted
Mr. Tripathi, no evidence, whatsoever, had been led, by the petitioner, to
substantiate its allegation that the relationship between the petitionerand
Respondent No. 2 was purely contractual, and that it exercised no control over
her.
23\. Mr. Tripathi also relied on a communication, dated 18th November, 2010,
from the petitionerto the Principal Information Officer, PIB, as well as a
certificate, dated 25th October, 2011, issued by the petitioner, both of which
were part of the record before the learned Labour Court. The communication
dated 18th November, 2010 stated that Respondent No. 2, ―holder of Government
of India press accreditation card number 478, will continue to be our South
Asia correspondent and chief of bureau in the year 2011‖ and, for that reason,
sought renewal of her accreditation. Similarly, the certificate dated 25th
October, 2011 certified that Respondent No. 2 ―is working full-time as a
reporter/researcher covering political and social events in India for the
foreign Department of Der Spiegel, the German news weekly‖, and went on to
state that ―the magazine will take full responsibility for work and will, of
course, carried the expenses which may occur‖. Again, for these reasons,
renewal of her accreditation was sought.
24\. In such circumstances, if the learned Labour Court held that there
existed, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, the relationship of
employer and employee, the finding could not be said to be tainted, in any
manner, by perversity, as would justify interference, therewith, by this
Court. Mr. Tripathi took me, in this W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 27 of 61 context,
through various documents, produced by Respondent No. 2 as evidence in her
support before the learned Labour Court, and sought to submit that these
documents more than discharged the burden of proof, cast on her, to establish
the relationship, between the petitionerand her, of employer and employee.
25\. The income tax returns of Respondent No. 2, Mr. Tripathi would seek to
submit, were totally irrelevant in determining the issue in controversy.
Declarations contained in the said returns, Mr. Tripathi would submit, could
only decide the entitlement, or otherwise, of Respondent No. 2, to deductions
sought by her, and could not be used as substantive evidence to determine the
nature of the relationship between her and the petitioner. The judgment
inM/sNew Era Impex (India) Pvt.Ltd. v. M/s Oriole Exports Pvt. Ltd., 2016 SCC
Online 4352, he would submit, was distinguishable.
26\. Expanding on the issue of the proceedings before the Hamburg Labour
Court, Mr. Tripathi drew especial attention to the averments, in the pleadings
of the petitionerbefore the said learned Court, already extracted hereinabove,
in which the petitionerdiscountenanced the challenge, of Respondent No. 2, to
the applicability, to the case, of Indian Law. He pointed out that it was
further admitted, in the pleadings, that the office at New Delhi, where
Respondent No. 2 worked, was maintained by the petitioner, and that it was
being used as a residence at her own choice. The same pleadings also admitted
the fact that several other employees, working in the said office, were also
paid by the petitioner. In view thereof, Mr. Tripathi would seek to contend
that it did not lie in the mouth of the petitionerto argue, before W.P.(C)
1841/2018 Page 28 of 61 this Court, or before the learned Labour Court below,
that Respondent No. 2 was not its permanent employee. In any event, Mr.
Tripathi would point out that, under Section 13(f) of the CPC, the order of
the Hamburg Labour Court was unenforceable in India. Besides, the rights of
Respondent No. 2, in Indian Law, could not be answered by the Labour Court at
Hamburg.
27\. The submission, of the petitioner, to the effect that it had not pleaded
financial constraints as the basis for not renewing the employment of
Respondent No. 2 was, Mr. Tripathi would seek to point out, erroneous, for
which purpose my attention was invited to various pages of the evidence before
the learned Labour Court.
28\. Detailed written submissions have also been filed by the parties.
Analysis and findings Scope of interference
29\. I have already had occasion, in my earlier judgment s in, inter alia,
D.T.C. v. Saroop Singh, 2017 SCC Online Del 10602 and D.T.C. v. Bijender
Singh, 2018 SCC Online Del 8852, to opine on the limited scope of
interference, by writ courts, with awards of Labour Courts and Industrial
Tribunals. Paras 31 and 32 of the judgment inSaroop Singh (supra) read thus:
> ―31. This Court has, in its recent decision dated 21st July2017in D.D.A. v.
> MoolChand [W.P. (C) 9468 of 2004], delineated the following principles as
> emerging from the definitive judicial authorities on the subject, W.P.(C)
> 1841/2018 Page 29 of 61 regarding the scope of interference, under Article
> 226 of the Constitution of India, with the findings of the Labour
> Court/Industrial Tribunal:
> (i) The Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal is the final fact finding
> authority.
> (ii) The High Court, in exercise of its powers under Article 226/227, would
> not interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the Labour Court, unless
> the said findings are perverse, based on no evidence or based on
> illegal/unacceptable evidence.
> (iii) In the event that, for any of these reasons, the High Court feels that
> a case for interference is made out, it is mandatory for the High Court to
> record reasons for interfering with the findings of fact of the Labour
> Courts/Industrial Tribunal, before proceeding to do so.
> (iv) Adequacy of evidence cannot be looked into, while examining, in writ
> jurisdiction, the evidence of the Labour Court.
> (v) Neither would interference, by the writ court, with the findings of fact
> of the Labour Court, be justified on the ground that a different view might
> possibly be taken on the said facts.
> 30\. On what constitutes ―perversity‖, it is observed in paras 29 and 30 of
> the said decision, thus:
> "29.‗Perversity', for its part, is attributed to a judicial/quasi judicial
> decision if the decision ignores/excludes relevant material, considers
> irrelevant/inadmissible material, is against the weight of evidence, or so
> outrageously defies logic W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 30 of 61 as to suffer from
> irrationality [DamodarDass v. Sohan Devi, (2016) 3 SCC 78; S.R. Tiwari v.
> Union of India, (2013) 6 SCC 602; Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi
> Administration, (1984) 4 SCC 635; Kuldeep Singh v. Commissioner of Police,

> Babu v. State of Kerala, (2010) 9 SCC 189; Dr. Sunil Kumar Sambhudayal Gupta
> v. State of Maharashtra, (2010) 13 SCC 657].
> 30\. DamodarDass (Supra)further postulates that in examining whether a
> decision is, or is not, perverse, the classic test, of the reasonable man's
> conclusion on the facts before the authority concerned would apply. The same
> decision also reiterates the trite position that inadequacy of evidence, or
> the possibility of reading the evidence in a different manner, would not
> amount to perversity.‖
> 31\. In Bhuvnesh Kumar Dwivedi (supra), the Supreme Court holds, in para 22
> of the report, thus:
> ―A careful reading of the judgments reveals that the High Court can
> interfere with an order of the Tribunal only on the procedural level and in
> cases, where the decision of the lower courts has been arrived at in gross
> violation of the legal principles. The High Court shall interfere with
> factual aspect placed before the Labour Courts only when it is convinced

> the Constitution amounts to exceeding its jurisdiction conferred upon it.‖
> W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 31 of 61
> 32\. Mr. Tripathi is, therefore, right in contending that, ordinarily,
> awards of Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals are not readily subjected
> to judicial interference by writ courts. The present case would, therefore,

The effect of the order of the Hamburg Labour Court
33\. It was sought to be pleaded, by Mr. Dewan , that, in view of the order,
dated 30th October, 2012, passed by the Labour Court at Hamburg, the present
writ petition was barred by the principles of res judicata and issue estoppel,
and that this Court would be acting in excess of jurisdiction, were it to
revisit issues on which the Labour Court of Hamburg had already returned
findings.
34\. A bare reading of the order, dated 30th October, 2012, passed by the
Labour Court at Hamburg, demonstrates the inherent fallacy of this submission.
35\. No doubt, the claim of Respondent No. 2, before the Labour Court at
Hamburg was similar to that raised before the Labour Court in the present
case. The ―request‖ of Respondent No. 2, before the Labour Court at Hamburg,
was recorded, in the Order dated 30 th October, 2012 supra, as being ―that the
Court should declare that there exists a relationship between (sic of?)
employer and employee between the parties with no fixed term‖.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 32 of 61
36\. It is necessary, here, to reproduce the decision of the Labour Court at
Hamburg, in extenso, thus:
> ― 1. The action is inadmissible.
> There is no interest of the claimant to seek declaratory judgment as
> required under section 256(1) Code of Civil Procedure. According to that
> rule of Law, an action seeking a declaratory judgment finding on the
> existence or non-existence of a legal relationship may be brought where the
> claimant party has a legal interest in a judicial decision finding on the
> legal relationship. In any position of the procedure, the court, by virtue
> of his office, has to review the special interest of the claimant in a
> declaratory judgment under section 256(1) Code of Civil Procedure, being a
> prerequisite for a judgment on the merits. In doing so, the court does not,
> by virtue of his office, have to examine the facts. Instead, the claimant
> party has to state the required facts and prove them if necessary.
> The Federal Labour Court, in its established practice, has found that
> actions brought by employees for declaratory judgments finding that the
> relationship between employer and employee exists between the parties, i.e.,
> actions relating to the present situations, are admissible including when it
> turns out already in the course of the lawsuit on status that the parties
> will later argue about individual terms of employment.[Federal labour court
> (BAG),judgement of 03.03.1999 in case no. 5 AZR 275/9A, cited from juris] In
> such actions, the interest that a finding be made forthwith follows from the
> fact that if there exists a relationship between employer and employee, then
> the mandatory provisions of the law that shape a relationship between
> employer and employee will forthwith and not only in future apply to the
> parties contractual relationship notwithstanding the understandings they
> have reached. This also applies where a dispute over individual terms of
> employment is foreseeable. For purposes of procedural economy it would make
> little sense from the outset to burden a W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 33 of 61
> lawsuit regarding the assessment of an employee status with contentious
> issues, say regarding the hourly scope of employment or the employees
> grouping, which are issues the parties typically clarified negotiations if
> the lawsuit has a positive outcome. An answer to questions that are crucial
> to an employee regarding the protection of their legal relationship under
> employment law must not be delayed by what is unavoidable extension of the
> matter in dispute. The status question is the fundamental question in such
> lawsuits; it is possible to pose the question, in advance, prior to a
> judicial decision.
> These prerequisites are not met here.
> In the matter at issue, the action is to seek a declaratory judgment on a
> legal relationship that has ended. Certainly, the claimant's action
> originally sought a declaratory judgment in regard to the presence. However,
> the party's legal relationship was terminated as of the lapse of 30 April

> Had the parties' contractual relationship qualified as a relationship
> between employer and employee and if German law applied, such a relationship
> between employer and employee still would have ended as of the lapse of 30
> April 2012. After all, the claimant did not file a request with the Labour
> Court for part-time control pursuant to section 17 Part-time and Temporary
> Employment Act. Pursuant to section 17 sentence 1 Part- time and Temporary
> Employment Act, an action has not been filed in time unless the request for

> given on the filing of the action indicate that the claimant seeks to claim
> that the relationship between employer and employee did not, by virtue of
> the fixed term agreed at atime,end as of the date provided for in that
> agreement.
> This is definitely not the case here.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 34 of 61
> The claimant's request for relief dated 12 December 2011 is an ordinary
> request seeking a declaratory judgment on status. The fact that the request
> for relief includes the word ―unbefristet" (with no fixed term‖) permits no
> different assessment.
> Neither the request for relief nor the statement of grounds for the action

> Claimant was seeking to claim that her ―relationship between employer-
> employee‖ did not end by virtue of the ―fixed term agreed on 24 February

37\. Section 256(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, 1877 (hereinafter
referred to as ―the German CPC‖) reads thus:
> ―256. Action for acknowledgement (1) A complaint may be filed to establish
> the existence of non-existence of a legal relationship, to recognise a deed
> or to establish that it is false, if the plaintiff has a legitimate interest
> in having the legal relationship, or the authenticity of falsity of the
> deed, established by a judicial ruling at the court's earliest convenience.‖
> W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 35 of 61
38\. Read in the backdrop of Section 256 (1) of the German CPC, it is clear
that the Labour Court and Hamburg did not adjudicate on the issue, regarding
which Respondent No. 2 had sought a declaratory judgment from it, i.e.,
regarding the existence of a relationship of employer and employee, between
the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, with no fixed term. Section 256(1) of the
German CPC permits a litigant to seek such a declaration of existence of a
jural relationship, where ―the plaintiff has a legitimate interest in having
the legal relationship... established by a judicial ruling at the court's
earliest convenience‖. The Labour Court at Hamburg has, in its Order dated
30th October, 2012 supra, opined that, as the relationship between the
petitionerand Respondent No. 2 had ended, and, applying German law, even if a
relationship of employer and employee had existed, between them, prior to 30th
April, 2012, the said relationship would still have ended as on 30th April,
2012, and as there was no claim, by Respondent No. 2, for a declaration that
the said relationship had not ended on 30th April, 2012, there ―did not
survive any continuing interest, in Respondent No. 2, for a declaration
regarding the existence of the said relationship, which could be said to have
implications for the presence or the future.‖ This Court is not required to go
into the correctness, or otherwise, of the said interpretation, or view,
expressed by the Labour Court at Hamburg. Suffice it to state that, clearly,
the Labour Court at Hamburg not think it appropriate to enter into the issue
referred to it by Respondent No. 2,, regarding the issue of whether there had
existed, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, a relationship of
employer and employee.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 36 of 61
39\. The said issue may not have had any implications on the rights of
Respondent No. 2, vis-à-vis the petitioner, in German law. They do, however,
in the law that applies in this country. In case a workman is retrenched by an
employer, in contravention of Section 25-F of the ID Act, labour Courts in
India have to strike down the retrenchment as illegal, and all consequential
benefits would, thereupon, enure in favour of the retrenched workman. It is a
defence, to the management, in all such cases, to plead that there was no
employer-employee relationship, between the management and the litigating
workman. Such a defence has, predictably, been taken, in the present case, as
well, by the petitioner, vis-à-vis Respondent No. 2. The determination of the
nature of the relationship, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 in the
present case is, therefore, necessary, before the Labour Court could arrive at
a decision, regarding the merits of the claim of Respondent No. 2.
40\. The Labour Court at Hamburg not having returned any finding on this
issue, this Court would, therefore, in examining the said aspect, not be
revisiting the decision of the Labour Court at Hamburg in any manner, or to
any extent. The said objection, as voiced by Mr. Dewan, appearing for the
petitioner, is, therefore, completely without merit and is, accordingly,
rejected.
41\. For the same reason, the pleas of res judicata and issue estoppel, as
raised by the petitioner, have also to fail. It is well settled that it is
only a decision which decides an issue, which can operate as res judicata for
a future litigation. A four-judge bench of the Supreme W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page
37 of 61 Court had, as far back as in Sheodan Singh v. Daryao Kunwar, AIR 1966
SC 1332, held thus, on the issue of res judicata, and Section 11 of the CPC,
which governs the same:
> ―A plain reading of Section 11 shows that to constitute a matter res
> judicata, the following conditions must be satisfied, namely--
> (i) The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit or
> issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue

This distinction was tellingly, even if briefly, emphasised, by the Supreme
Court, in Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar, (2005) 1 SCC 787, in the
following words:
> 29\. There is a distinction between ―issue estoppel‖ and ―res judicata‖.
> (See Thodayv. Thoday [(1964) 1 All ER 341 : (1964) 2 WLR 371 : 1964 P 181
> (CA)] .)

> estoppel viz. estoppel by accord.‖ (Emphasis supplied)
43\. Inasmuch as the Labour Court at Hamburg did not decide any issue, and
expressed no opinion on the jural relationship, existing between the
petitionerand Respondent No. 2, the order, dated 30 th October, 2012, of the
Labour Court at Hamburg, cannot impact, in any W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 39 of 61
manner, the present litigation. The reliance, by Mr. Dewan, on the said order,
as a basis to contend that Respondent No. 2 was estopped from maintaining the
industrial dispute, which has resulted in the impugned Award, and that the
Labour Court was, in turn, precluded from adjudicating on the said dispute,
is, therefore, necessarily required to be characterised as misplaced and the
objection of Mr. Dewan, founded thereon, is, accordingly, rejected.
Applicability of the Working Journalists Act:
44\. The objection, of Mr. Dewan, to the fact that the Labour Court did not,
in the present case, address the issue of applicability of the Working
Journalists Act, is well taken. However, as the issue was argued, threadbare,
before me, both on facts as well as in law, I proceed to examine the same on
merits, instead of remitting the matter to the Labour Court for a decision
thereon.
45\. Section 3 of the Working Journalists Act, which makes the provisions, of
the ID Act, applicable, mutatis mutandis, to working journalists covered by
the Working Journalists Act, reads thus:
> ―3. Act 14 of 1947 to apply to working journalists. -
> (1) The provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947) as in
> force for the time being, shall, subject to the modifications specified in
> sub- section (2), apply to, or in relation to, working journalists as they
> apply to, or in relation to, workmen within the meaning of that Act.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 40 of 61
> (2) Section 25F of the aforesaid Act, in its application to working
> journalists, shall be construed as if in clause (a) thereof, for the period
> of notice referred to therein in relation to the retrenchment of workmen,
> the following periods of notice in relation to the retrenchment of a working
> journalist had been substituted, namely: -
> (a) 6 months, in the case of an editor, and
> (b) 3 months, in the case of any other working journalist.‖
46\. ―Working journalist‖ is defined in clause (f) of Section 2 of the Working
Journalists Act, as meaning ―a person whose principal avocation is that of a
journalist and who is employed as such, either full-time or part-time, in, or
in relation to, one or more newspaper establishments, and includes an editor,
a leader-writer, news editor, sub- editor, feature-writer, copy-tester,
reporter, the respondent, cartoonist, news-photographer and proof-reader, but
does not include any such person who -
> (i) is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity, or
> (ii) being employed in a supervisory capacity, performs, either by the
> nature of the duties attached to his office or by reason of the powers
> vested in him, functions mainly of a managerial nature‖.
47\. That Respondent No. 2 was a journalist, is not, and cannot be, denied.
Nor can it be denied that she was employed by the petitioner, as the letter,
dated 9th April, 1998 supra, itself refers to her as a W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page
41 of 61 ―freelance employee‖ of the petitioner. Having thus designated her in
its letter dated 9th April, 1998, it cannot lie in the mouth of the
petitionerto contend, before this Court, that the respondent was not its
employee. Significantly, it is not necessary, for a person to qualify to be
regarded as a ―working journalist‖, under the Working Journalists Act, to be
employed in the newspaper establishment. It is sufficient if she, or he, is
employed in relation to the said establishment. All persons, therefore, whose
principal avocation is journalism, and who, though not employed in a newspaper
establishment, are employed in relation to a newspaper establishment, would
satisfy the definition of ―working journalist‖, for the purpose of application
of the Working Journalists Act.Every journalist, who is employed, in her/his
capacity of journalist, by, or in relation to, a newspaper establishment, is,
per definition, ―working journalist‖, within the meaning of the Working
Journalists Act, the only exceptions being in respect of persons falling under
the categories contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) in clause (f) of Section 2
of the Working Journalists Act supra. The petitionerdoes not seek to contend
that Respondent No. 2 was employed in a managerial or a supervisory capacity.
48\. The main contention, of Mr. Dewan, apropos the applicability, to the
facts of the present case, of the Working Journalists Act, is not that
Respondent No. 2 is not a ―working journalist‖, as ordinarily understood, but
that the petitioneris not a ―newspaper establishment‖, within the meaning of
the expression is used in the said Act.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 42 of 61
49\. ―Newspaper establishment‖ is defined in clause (d) of Section 2 of the
Working Journalists Act as meaning ―an establishment under the control of any
person or body of persons, whether incorporated or not, for the production or
publication of one or more newspapers or for conducting any news agency or
syndicate and includes newspaper establishments specified as one establishment
under the Schedule‖. The explanation to the said clause clarifies that, for
the purposes thereof, ―(a) different departments, branches and centres of
newspaper establishments shall be treated as parts thereof‖ and ―(b) a
printing press shall be deemed to be a newspaper establishment if the
principal business thereof is to print newspaper‖. ―Newspaper‖, in turn, is
defined, in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Working Journalists Act as meaning
―any printed periodical work containing public news or comments on public
news‖, and as including ―such other class of printed periodical work as may,
from time to time, be notified in this behalf by the Central Government in the
Official Gazette‖.
50\. ―Der Spiegel‖ is, admittedly, a printed periodical work, containing
public news. It is, therefore, a ―newspaper‖, within the meaning of clause (b)
of Section 2 of the Working Journalists Act supra. Can, however, Respondent
No. 2 be stated to be employed in a ―newspaper establishment‖?
51\. The word ―establishment‖ does not find definition, either in the Working
Journalists Act, or in the ID act. Dealing with a similar situation, which
involved the understanding of the expression ―establishment‖ in the context of
the Employees State Insurance Act, W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 43 of 61 1948 -
which, like the ID Act and the Working Journalists Act, is a piece of social
welfare legislation - the Supreme Court held thus, in Bangalore Turf Club
Limited v. Regional Director, Employee State Insurance Corporation , (2014) 9
SCC 657:
> ―31. We may safely conclude that the literal rule of construction may be the
> primary approach to be utilised for interpretation of a statute and that
> words in the statute should in the first instance be given their meaning as
> understood in common parlance. However, the ESI Act is a beneficial
> legislation. It seeks to provide social security to those workers as it
> encompasses. In the light of the cases referred above, it may be seen that
> the traditional approach can be substituted. A dictionary meaning may be
> attached to the words in a statute in preference over the traditional
> meaning. However, for this purpose as well, the scheme, context and objects
> of the legislature must be taken into consideration. Taking into due
> consideration the nature and purpose of the ESI Act, the dictionary meaning
> as understood in the context of the said Act would be preferable to achieve
> the objects of the legislature.
> 34\. In the absence of any definition as provided in the ESI Act, this Court
> may look into its dictionary meaning for guidance or as an aid of
> construction of the term ―establishment‖. Dictionaries do define the meaning
> of a word as understood in common parlance:
> 34.1. According to Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Edn. (1999), the term
> ―establishment‖ means, inter alia:
> ―establishment.-- n. ... (2) An institution or place of business.‖ 34.2.
> According to Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn., Vol. 15, the term
> ―establishment‖ has been held to mean, inter alia, the following:
> ―An establishment means a permanent commercial organisation or a
> manufacturing W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 44 of 61 establishment. Spielman v.
> Industrial Commission [295 NW 1 : 236 Wis 240 (1940)] , NW p. 4.‖ ―An
> establishment is the place where one is permanently fixed for residence or
> business such as an office or place of business with its fixtures.
> Lorenzetti v. American Trust Co. [45 F Supp 128 (ND Cal 1942)] , F Supp p.
> 139.‖ 34.3. According to Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LXXX, the term
> ―establishment‖ has been explained as follows:
> ―Establishment.-- ... More specifically, a fixed place where business is
> conducted, or a place where the public is invited to come and have its work
> done; an institution or place of business with its fixtures and organised
> staff; any office or place of business, with its fixtures, the place in
> which one is permanently fixed for residence or business; a permanent
> commercial organisation, as a manufacturing establishment; the place of
> business or residence with grounds, fixtures, equipage, etc., with which one
> is fitted out; also that which serves for the carrying on of a business....‖
> 35\. Therefore, it can be simply stated that an ―establishment‖ is a term
> which can have a wide meaning. It would be any place where business is
> conducted, or in other words, it would be any place of business. Now the
> question arises whether a ―race club‖ is in the nature of a place where
> business is conducted. To answer the same, the activities that are
> undertaken by the appellant Turf Club require to be noticed.
> 37\. The term ―establishment‖ would mean the place for transacting any
> business, trade or profession or work connected with or incidental or
> ancillary thereto. It is true that the definition in dictionaries is the
> conventional definition attributed to trade or commerce, but it cannot be
> wholly valid for the purpose of constructing social W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page
> 45 of 61 welfare legislation in a modern welfare State. The test of finding
> out whether professional activity falls within the meaning of the expression
> ―establishment‖ is whether the activity is systematically and habitually
> undertaken for production or distribution of the goods or services to the
> community with the help of employees in the manner of a trade or business in
> such an undertaking. If a systematic economic or commercial activity is
> carried on in the premises, it would follow that the establishment at which
> such an activity is carried on is a ―shop‖. This Court, in ESICorpn. v.
> Hyderabad Race Club, (2004) 6 SCC 191 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 855, keeping in view
> the systematic commercial activity carried on by the club has held that the
> race club is an establishment within the meaning of the said expression as
> used in the notification issued under Section 1(5) of the ESI Act.
> Therefore, in our considered view, the view expressed by this Court is in
> consonance with the provisions of the ESI Act and also settled legal
> principles. Therefore, the said decision does not require reconsideration.‖
> (Underscoring supplied)
52\. It is admitted, even by the petitioner, that Respondent No. 2 has been
working as its South Asia correspondent for over 14 years, and that the rent
for the premises, from which she has been functioning during the said period,
has been paid for by the petitioner. In its pleadings before the Labour Court
and Hamburg, the petitioneradmitted, further, that the office, at Golf Links,
New Delhi, where Respondent No. 2 worked, was being maintained by the
petitioner, and was being used as a residence by Respondent No. 2 at her own
choice. It was further admitted, in the same pleadings, that several other
employees, working in the said office, were also paid by the petitioner. Even
in respect of the staff, employees in the said office, regarding whom
Respondent No. 2 retained the right to hire, W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 46 of 61
and fire, permission, from the petitionerat Hamburg, had necessarily to be
obtained before taking any such decision. The salaries paid to the said staff
were also determined by the petitionerat Hamburg, and, though disbursed
physically by Respondent No. 2, was subject to reimbursement by the
petitionerat Hamburg. The asseverations, in this regard, as contained in the
affidavit-in-evidence tendered by Respondent No. 2, testifying as WW-1, and
her evidence, during trial, as well as cross-examination, cumulatively viewed,
indicates, inescapably, that the premises at Golf Links, in which Respondent
No. 2 lived and worked, were especially provided to her, by the petitioner, in
order for her to discharge the duties towards the petitioner. No other work
was being transacted from the said premises. It is also an admitted position
that, during this entire period, Respondent No. 2 was the accredited South
Asia correspondent of the petitioner. In these circumstances, the premises at
Golf Links, from where Respondent No. 2 worked and discharged her duties as
South Asiacorrespondent for the petitioner, necessarily constituted part of
the petitioner's establishment. The plea, of Mr. Dewan, that the
petitionercould not be said to have any ―newspaper Establishment‖ in India is,
therefore, rejected.
53\. As Respondent No. 2 was a ―working journalist‖, ―Der Spiegel‖ was a
―newspaper‖, and the premises occupied by Respondent No. 2 in New Delhi were
part of the ―newspaper establishment‖ of the petitioner, the provisions of the
Working Journalists Act clearly applied to the present case.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 47 of 61
54\. It is true that the head office of the petitioneris in Hamburg, Germany.
This fact, however, makes no difference, at all, to the present case. The
petitioner, having elected to open an office, in New Delhi, in which it had
placed its ―South Asia correspondent‖, it was bound, qua the said
establishment/office, by the laws of this country. Respondent No. 2, being an
Indian citizen, working in India, and fulfilling the definition of ―workman‖,
as contained in the ID Act and of ―working journalist‖ under the Working
Journalists Act, was entitled, consequently, to the protection of both the
said statutes. In applying the provisions of the Working Journalists Act, or
the ID Act, to Respondent No. 2, therefore, the Court cannot be said to be
according, to either of the said statutes, any extraterritorial application.
The objection, of Mr. Dewan, on the said score, is also, therefore, without
merit.
55\. The seminal issue which arises for consideration in the present case is,
however, the nature of employment, of Respondent No. 2 by the petitioner, and
whether Respondent No. 2 could be said to have been illegally retrenched, by
the petitioner, so as to entitle her to reinstatement.
56\. The petitioner's contention is that the relationship between Respondent
No. 2 and the petitionerwas expressly contractual in nature, continued on a
year-to-year basis, but bearing no semblance to permanent employment. Being
contractual in nature, the employment of Respondent No. 2 could be terminated,
as the petitionerwould seek to contend, at any point of time, and the Labour
Court, therefore, materially erred in holding that the termination of the said
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 48 of 61 relationship, which was but a natural
consequence of the non- extension, by the petitioner, of the contract with
Respondent No. 2 beyond 30th April, 2012, was illegal. According to the
petitioner, there was no duty cast, on it, to continue to extend the contract
of Respondent No. 2 in perpetuity, and Respondent No. 2 also continued in her
employment in the full awareness of the fact that her relationship, which the
petitioner, was, at all times, only contractual in nature, till the 30th of
the next April.
57\. Jurisprudentially, the submission of the petitionerdoes not pass muster.
Indian law does not permit keeping of workmen indefinitely on contract basis,
even if by providing artificial breaks. In Bhuvnesh Kumar Dwivedi (supra), the
Supreme Court holds thus:
> ―26.2. Secondly, the claim of the respondent that the appellant was a
> temporary worker is not acceptable to us. On perusal of facts, it is
> revealed that his service has been terminated several times and he was
> subsequently employed again till his service was finally terminated on
> 27-7-1998. His brief periods of contracts with the respondent have been from
> 28-12-1992 to 28-12-1993 for the first time, from 3-4-1994 to 29-12-1994 for
> the second time, from 10-1-1995 to 5-1-1996 for the third time, from
> 16-1-1996 to 11-1-1997 for the fourth time, from 20-1-1997 to 21-1-1998 for
> the fifth time and from 27-1-1998 to 27-7-1998 for a final time at the end
> of which his service was terminated.
> 27\. Very interestingly, the periods of service extends to close to 6 years
> save the artificial breaks made by the respondent with an oblique motive so
> as to retain the appellant as a temporary worker and deprive the appellant
> of his statutory right of permanent worker status. The aforesaid conduct of
> the respondent perpetuates "unfair labour practice" as defined under W.P.(C)
> 1841/2018 Page 49 of 61 Section 2(ra) of the ID Act, which is not
> permissible in view of Sections 25-T and 25-U of the ID Act read with entry
> at Serial No. 10 in the Vth Schedule to the ID Act regarding unfair labour
> practices. Section 2(ra) reads thus:
> ―2.(ra) ‗unfair labour practice' means any of the practices specified in the
> Fifth Schedule.‖ Further, Entry 10 of the Vth Schedule reads as under:
> ―5. To discharge or dismiss workmen--
> ***
> 10\. To employ workmen as ‗badlis', casuals or temporaries and to continue
> them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the status and
> privileges of permanent workmen.‖
> 28\. The respondent, in order to mitigate its conduct towards the appellant
> has claimed that the appellant was appointed solely on contract basis, and
> his service has been terminated in the manner permissible under Section
> 2(oo)(bb) of the ID Act. However, we shall not accept this contention of the
> respondent for the following reasons:
> 28.1. Firstly, the respondent has not produced any material evidence on
> record before the Labour Court to prove that it meets all the required
> criteria under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, to
> be eligible to employ employees on contractual basis which includes licence
> number, etc. 28.2. Secondly, the respondent could not produce any material
> evidence on record before the Labour Court to show that the appellant was
> employed for any particular project(s) on the completion of which his
> service has been terminated through non-renewal of his contract of
> employment.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 50 of 61
> 29\. Therefore, we deem it fit to construe that the appellant has rendered
> continuous service for six continuous years (save the artificially imposed
> break) as provided under Section 25-B of the ID Act and can therefore be
> subjected to retrenchment only through the procedure mentioned in the ID Act
> or the State Act in parimateria.
> 30\. Therefore, we answer Point (ii) in favour of the appellant holding that
> the Labour Court was correct in holding that the action of the respondent

> requires to comply with the mandatory requirement of the provisions of
> Section 6-N of the U.P. ID Act. Undisputedly, the same has not been complied

> initio in law.‖ (Emphasis supplied)
58\. Even in the letter, dated 9th April, 1998, which may be regarded as the
terminus a quo of the relationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2,
Respondent No. 2 is referred to as a ―freelance employee‖ of the petitioner.
There is a distinction between a person who is an employee of another, and a
person who is employed by another. Employment of one person, by another, would
conceivably cover all cases where money is paid by one, to another, for
rendition of services. In contradistinction, if one is regarded as an employee
of another, which indicates, clearly, the existence of a jural relationship of
employee and employer, of the character of servant and master, between the
two.
59\. The letter dated 9th April, 1998 supra goes on, further, to identify the
duties, of Respondent No. 2, for Spiegel Publishers, which, it is stated,
would be ―along the lines specified by us in our W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 51 of
61 discussion; reportage and other writing‖. For this, the communication goes
on to state that Respondent No. 2 would receive a monthly retainer, along with
a monthly payment towards the rent of the office/residence at New Delhi. This
arrangement, notably, continued for 14 long years, and, in such circumstances,
the inescapable conclusion is that the amount which was euphemistically being
paid, month by month, to Respondent No. 2, as a ―monthly retainer‖ was, to all
intents and purposes, salary. The distinction, being sought to be drawn, by
Mr. Dewan, between our ―monthly retainership‖, which was being paid by the
petitionerto Respondent No. 2, and salary is, therefore, too tenuous to pass
legal muster.
60\. In this context, one may profitably refer to Grounds C to E in the writ
petition, which read thus:
> ―C. FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court failed to consider that the Contract
> clearly designated Respondent No 2 as a ―Freelance‖ employee of Respondent
> No. 2 (sic the Petitioner). The contract was admittedly extended to 12 times
> on a year-on-year-basis, and continued uninterruptedly for a period of 14
> years, and Respondent No 2 was never treated as a permanent employee of the
> Petitioner.
> D. FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court also failed to appreciate the Respondent No
> 2 had herself admitted in her cross-examination that ―It is correct that my
> regularisation did not happen between 1998-2012 although it was promised
> verbally. Thus, in the absence of my regularisation, during the period
> 1998-2012 I continued as a contractual employee..."
> E. FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court failed to appreciate that Respondent No. 2
> had herself admitted in her pleadings that Respondent No. 2 ―was assured on
> W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 52 of 61 numerous occasions that she would be
> conferred the status of permanent employee in due course" and that
> Respondent No. 2 ―was always considered as a permanent employee while taking
> work, but treated as contractual while paying for the work‖. The same
> clearly evinces that both the parties recognise Respondent No. 2's status as
> a freelance employee of the Petitionerand not as a permanent employee.
> Further, Respondent No. 2 herself had all along treated herself as a
> freelancer from 1998 onwards and expressed reservation as to her nature of
> engagement only towards the end of 2010.‖ (Emphasis supplied)
61\. The above passages, from the record of cross-examination of Respondent
No. 2, as carried out by the petitionerbefore the learned Labour Court, on
which the petitionerseeks to place reliance, are significant and revealing in
equal measure. The petitioner, by placing reliance on the said passages,
without denying any part thereof, impliedly accepts everything that is stated
in the said passages. The petitionerhas, thereby, admitted the fact that (i)
the contract of Respondent No. 2 was extended 12 times on a year-to-year
basis, (ii) the said contract continued uninterruptedly for a period of 14
years,
(iii) the petitionerverbally promised to regularise Respondent No. 2, but did
not do so, (iv) Respondent No. 2 was assured, on numerous occasions, by the
petitioner, that she would be conferred the status of permanent employee in
due course, and (v) while taking work, the petitionerwas always considering
Respondent No. 2 as a permanent employee, but while making payment to her, was
treated her a contractual employee. These depositions, by Respondent No. 2 in
cross-examination before the learned Labour Court, have been relied upon, by
the petitioner, in the writ petition, without denying any part W.P.(C)
1841/2018 Page 53 of 61 thereof. These facts, even by themselves, are
sufficient to justify the finding, of the learned Labour Court, that
Respondent No. 2 was, effectively, a permanent employee of the petitioner,
entitled to be treated as such, and that the petitioner, by keeping her on
contract uninterruptedly for 14 years, even without any artificial break, was
clearly guilty of unfair labour practice.
62\. Interestingly, in Ground F in the writ petition, the petitionercandidly,
though, perhaps, unwittingly, seeks to rely on the fact that Respondent No. 2
―had willingly endured the contractual extension for 12 years‖. Having thus
endured - as the petitioneritself admits - being continued on contract for 12
years (actually 14 years), the benefits, of such endurance, must, of needs,
now enure, to her benefit, as well.
63\. Much has been sought to be made of the use of the expression ―freelance‖
in the agreement, dated 9th April, 1998, between the petitionerand Respondent
No. 2. The learned Labour Court is, in this context, perfectly correct in
observing that the nature of the jural relationship, between the petitionerand
Respondent No. 2 would fall to be determined, not merely on the basis of the
nomenclature, attributed to the said relationship, in the letter of
appointment, but to the character of the employment, as borne out from facts.
The communications, dated 4th July, 1998, 5th October, 1998, 6th October,
1998, 17th July, 2001, 30th September, 2002, 8th October, 2003, 6th October,
2004, 26th October, 2005, 12th November, 2007, 10th October, 2008 and 18th
November, 2010 from the petitionerto the W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 54 of 61
Principal Information Officer, Press Information Bureau, the communication
dated 7th September, 2005 from the petitionerto the Embassy of the USA at New
Delhi, the communication dated 12th July, 2000 from the petitionerto the
Director-General, ISPR, Islamabad and the certificate, dated 25th October,
2011, issued by the petitioner, all of which formed part of the record before
the learned Labour Court below, clearly acknowledged that Respondent No. 2 was
the accredited South Asia correspondent of the petitioner, and was based, for
the said purpose, in New Delhi. The petitioneralso undertook to bear all
expenses incidental thereto. Periodical requests, to the Press Information
Bureau, for extension of the accreditation of Respondent No. 2, were made by
the petitioner. Permission for Customs duty exemption, on the laptop, and
other items being used by Respondent No. 2, for discharging her functions as
South Asia correspondent of the petitioner, was also sought, by the
petitioneritself. The tenor of these communications is clear and unmistakable.
Not only was Respondent No. 2 the South Asia correspondent of the petitioner;
she also appears to have been a much- valued correspondent, with the
petitionergoing out of its way to ensure that her tenure was comfortable.
64\. The character of the employment, of Respondent No. 2, by the petitioner,
as being that of a regular employee, is also underscored by her having been
(i) allowed to vote, in yearly elections, to the employee's advisory
Council/Union, for which she received a voting slip every year, (ii) issued a
German press card by the Association of German Magazine Publishers North e.V,
(iii) directed to report, W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 55 of 61 directly, to the
petitionerat Hamburg, (iv) disbursed salary directly from Hamburg, and (v)
told to maintain her work timings as per the work timings at Hamburg. It is
also borne out by the fact that the agreement, between the petitionerand
Respondent No. 2 was drawn in Hamburg, the decision to run, or not to run, the
stories of Respondent No. 2, was taken at Hamburg, and permission from Hamburg
was required even to travel in connection with work. Besides, Respondent No. 2
reported solely to the Senior Foreign Editor of the petitioner- institution at
Hamburg. The manner in which the petitionerused to function, as testified by
her during cross-examination, and as extracted in para 12 supra, also
indicates, clearly and unmistakably, that Respondent No. 2 was working as a
paid employee of the petitioner, dedicated entirely to the work of the
petitioner. The submission, of Mr. Dewan , that there was no embargo on
Respondent No. 2 working for anyone else, and that, if she did not do so, it
was of her own will and volition, is too facile to meet with approval; the
character of the relationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 was,
clearly, such that Respondent No. 2 regarded herself, and the
petitionerregarded Respondent No. 2, as working solely for the petitioner.
These facts emerged from the evidence during trial, substantially from the
examination-in-chief of Respondent No. 2, and her cross-examination by the
petitioner, and, in the light thereof, the Labour Court could not be said to
have acted illegally, far less with any hint of perversity, in holding that
Respondent No. 2 was the employee of the petitioner, and of the
petitioneralone. Reliance on the word ‗freelance' cannot, in any manner,
reflect the nature of her employment. In fact, the terms of the agreement, as
stated above, W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 56 of 61 clearly indicate that the
control over her working, the remuneration payable, the timings to be
maintained as per work timings at Hamburg, travel which she had to undertake,
only with the permission of the petitioner at Hamburg, duly to report to the
senior officials at Hamburg, militate against the agreement being one of work
as a ‗freelance' as legally understood, as meaning ―a self employed person
offering services not under contract to any single employer‖ (Chambers 21st
century Dictionary, Reprinted 1998). The Respondent No. 2 was admittedly not
working for anyone else and, as far as her working is concerned, she was
completely controlled by the petitioner's officials at Hamburg. The agreement
that she was a ‗freelancer', therefore fails. She has, therefore, also to be
regarded as a ―working journalist‖, within the meaning of the Working
Journalists Act, and as a ―workman‖ within the meaning of the ID Act.
65\. Significantly, even in the letter dated 22nd February, 2012 supra,
whereby the petitioner sought to inform Respondent No. 2 that her contract
would not be extended beyond April 2012, it so states that Respondent No. 2
would not, therefore, be entitled to any ―monthly salary or fee thereafter‖.
The use of the words ―monthly salary‖ indicates, unmistakably, that the
petitioner recognised that Respondent No. 2 had been its salaried employee.
66\. Apropos the Income Tax returns filed by Respondent No. 2, Mr. Tripathi
has submitted that the manner in which Respondent No. 2 may have classified
her income, in the said returns, and the deductions claimed on the basis
thereof, cannot decide the jural relationship between her, and the petitioner.
In case the petitionerwas, W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 57 of 61 in fact, paying
salary to Respondent No. 2, that fact would not stand discountenanced by the
declaration, by Respondent No. 2, of the amounts received, by her, from the
petitioner, as income from business/profession, or by the claiming of
deduction, by her, of the said amount, on that count. At worst, it could
constitute the basis for the Income Tax authorities to deny the said
deduction. In case Respondent No. 2 has already availed the benefit of the
said deduction, that, too, cannot estop her from contending, in the present
case, that she was a permanent employee of the petitioner, or at least
entitled to be regarded as such.
67\. The judgment, of a coordinate Single Bench of this Court in New Era Impex
(India) Pvt Ltd, Supra, on which learned counsel for the petitionerseeks to
place reliance, is clearly distinguishable. In the said case, the issue
related to monies advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant. The fact of
advancing of the monies was not in dispute. The defendant sought to contend
that, though, in the financial books, the said amounts were described as
advance, that was only by way of accounting convenience, whereas the amounts
were actually in the nature of gift, given out of natural love and affection,
and that they were never intended to be recovered as loan or repaid, which was
the reason why neither of the companies that the on the said amounts as
payable expense, or receivable income. It was in this context that the learned
Single Judge, deciding the suit of the plaintiff, against the defendant, held
that, once the defendant had characterised the amounts, received from the
plaintiff, in its books of accounts, and before the taxation authorities, as
advance, it could not be permitted to W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 58 of 61 urge,
before the Civil Court, that the said money was a gift of love and affection.
The learned Single Judge also observed that, under Section 122 of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882, a corporate entity could not make a gift without
consideration or part with thisfund in such a manner. As against this, the
controversy, in the present case, essentially revolves around the
relationship, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2. The fact of payment
of monthly amounts, by the petitionerto Respondent No. 2, is not denied. The
fact of discharge of duties, by Respondent No. 2, for the petitioner, for 14
years, also stands established. What falls for consideration, in such a
situation, is whether the said amounts would be treated, not as salary, but
only as a ―monthly retainer‖. The income tax returns filed by Respondent No. 2
are only being relied upon, by the petitioner, to indicate that Respondent No.
2 had claimed deductions, on the said amounts, treating them as business from
income/profession. The factual and legal backdrop of the controversy, in the
present case, is entirely distinguishable from that which arose in New Era
Impex (supra). Once all other factors, seen in the light of the applicable
law, indicate that Respondent No. 2 was, in fact, being treated as a permanent
employee of the petitioner, and was discharging duties as such, under the
control of the petitionerand as per the details of the petitioner, for which
Respondent No. 2 was receiving a monthly payment, twelve times a year, it
would be facile to hold that the said payment was not ―salary‖, irrespective
of how Respondent No. 2 may, or may not, have treated the said amounts, while
filing her income tax returns. The reliance, on the said returns, by the
petitionerhas, therefore, to be necessarily characterised as misplaced.
W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 59 of 61
68\. It is trite law that an employer-employee relationship is to be inferred
from the following four circumstances (the four-fold test):
> (i) the authority which has made the appointment (here, the petitioner);
> (ii) the source from which the salary/remuneration emanates (here, the
> petitioner);
> (iii) controlof the employer over the employee in the performance of his
> functions, (here, the petitioner); and
> (iv) the authority to terminate the employment (here, the petitioner, as has
> been done in the present case).
All these criteria clearly hold out the ‗employer-employee' relationship
between the petitioner and the Respondent No. 2.
Conclusion
69\. In view of the above discussion, it cannot be said that the findings of
the learned Labour Court below, or the order passed by it as a consequence
thereof, suffers from any such inherent illegality, jurisdictional error, or
perversity, as would justify interference, therewith, by this Court, in
exercise of the limited jurisdiction conferred, on it, in such cases, by
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. I find no reason to differ with the
finding, of the Labour Court, to the effect that Respondent No. 2 was, in
essence, a permanent employee of the petitioner and not a ‗freelancer' and
that, having W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 60 of 61 uninterruptedly served the
petitioner, solely and to the exclusion of all others, for 14 years, even
without any artificial break, the decision of the petitionerto summarily
terminate its relationship with Respondent No.2, by refusing to review the
agreement between them beyond 30 th April, 2012, amounts to ―retrenchment‖,
within the meaning of Section 25-F of the ID Act, read with Section 3 of the
Working Journalists Act. The said termination of employment has, therefore, to
be characterised as illegal, and the learned Labour Court cannot be said to
have fallen into error in so holding.
70\. I was of the view that, possibly, an amicable resolution, to the
controversy, could be achieved, for which purpose the parties were referred to
mediation. However, the said efforts proved futile.
71\. As a result, this Court has no option but to uphold the impugned Award of
the learned Labour Court in toto.
72\. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed.
73\. This judgment shall not, however, preclude the petitioner and Respondent
No. 2 from continuing to explore the possibility of an amicable resolution of
the differences between them.
74\. No costs.
