     CITATOR INFO :
be ultra vires nor was the Import Control Policy impeached. A policy statement
was held to be not a statutory document. No person can con the basis of a
policy statement claim a right to the grant of an import licence. This Court,
also held that there is no absolute right much less a fundamental right, to
the grant of an import licence.
This Court in Deputy Assistant Iron and Steel Controller v. L, Manickchand,
Proprietor, Katrella Metal Corporation, Madras(4) held that no one has any
vested right to an import licence in terms of the policy in force at the time
of his application. There is no misconstruction of any statutory provision in
the present case. In the present case, it cannot be said that there is no
authority of law to reject an application for import licence.
For these reasons, the petition fails and is dismissed. Parties will pay and
bear their own costs.
V.M.K.

    HEADNOTE:
    The petitioners are a partnership firm.	 They are successors
    to  J.	Fernandes  & Company  (Original	 concern)  of  which
    Joshino Fernandes was the sole proprietor.  In the month  of
    October,  1961	the  original  concern	booked	orders	 for
    purchase   of  Surveying  &  Mathematical  Instruments	 and
    Surgical  & Scientific Instruments with a German firm.	 The
    orders	were  accepted by the German firm on  7th  November,
    1961.	On  19/20 December, 1961 Goa was liberated.   On  18
    January,   1962	  the  original	 concern  applied   to	 the
    Administrator of Goa for issuing an import licence for pound
    32,652.10  for	Surveying and Mathematical  Instruments	 and
    Surgical  and  Laboratory Equipments, along  with  necessary
    papers of firm commitments.  The original concern obtained a
    licence	 on 12 February, 1962.	The licence was No. 47.	  It
    opened	a letter of credit on 21 February, 1962 for  50	 per
    cent of the licence.  The Central Government on 21 February,
    1962  informed	the  Administrator, Goa,  that	the  Central
    Government withheld action on all pending cases where import
    had  been authorised.  Pursuant thereto	 the  Administrator,
    Goa  issued directions to suspend issue of letter of  credit
    and  all  cases relating to firm  commitments  entered	into
    before	18 December, 1961 which were till then not  disposed
    of, should be frozen.  On April 2, 1962 the Administrator of
    Goa issued a Press Note that imports into Goa, Daman and Diu
    would  be governed by three principles.	 First import  would
    be  allowed in cases (a) where letters of credits  had	been
    opened with the Banco National Ultra Marines on or before 18
    December,  1961; (b) where goods were, shipped on or  before
    20  December,  1961.  Second, imports of  pertain  specified
    items  were  banned.   Third, imports would  be	 allowed  of
    certain	 goods	to  the extent of 50  per  cent	 of  imports
    actually  made	in  the quarter of  September,	October	 and
    November, 1961.
    The  petitioner's licence No. 47 was revalidated on 28	May,
    1962 for pound 16,000 for which the petitioner bad not	till
    then opened letter of credit.
    868
    27 February, 1962 is the date when the Administrator of	 Goa
    suspended issue of fresh letter of credit.  In the month  of
    July, 1962 the petitioner effected imports
    of goods for the full	 value.
    The Imports and	    Exports Control Act, 1947 was applied to
    Goa, Daman & Diu from 1 October,   1963.
    In October, 1964 the original concern was taken over by	 the
    petitioner.
    In 1967 the Hand Book for the year 1967 declared the  period
    1 April, 1961 to 31 March, 1966 as the basic period and	 any
    one  year during the period could be selected as  the  basic
    import	 by  the  concerned  party  who	 would	become	 the
    established importers.
    On  15	May, 1967 the petitioner applied  to  the  licensing
    authorities  for recognising the change in the	constitution
    of  the	 firm  and fixation of quota for  which	 they  could
    import the goods.  The licensing authorities recognised	 the
    change	in the constitution but refused to fix the quota  on
    the  ground that the original licence No. 47 granted to	 the
    original  concern  on 12 February. 1962 was  not  issued  in
    accordance  with  the procedure followed for  the  issue  of
    licence	 at  that  time.  The  petitioner  filed  an  appeal
    against the order.  The appeal was rejected.
    This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners praying
    for  a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to  cancel
    four  orders  mentioned in the petition and to	issue  quota
    certificate to the petitioners.
    It was contended for the petitioners : (i) The	petitioners'
    fundamental  right  under Art. 14 is  violated	because	 the
    respondents  discriminated  against  the  petitioners.	 The
    respondents  granted licences to six parties.  There  is  no
    distinction  between  the cases of the petitioners  and	 the
    case  of the six traders. (ii) The licence No. 47  dated  12
    February,  1962 was a licence issued in accordance with	 the
    procedure  followed for the issue of licence at	 that  time.
    The directions of the Central Government were illegal.	 The
    Central Government was not competent to issue directions  to
    the  Administrator  of Goa except through the  President  in
    view  of  Arts. 239 and 240 of the Constitution.  (iii)	 The
    provisions  of	the  Goa,  Daman  and  Diu  (Administration)
    Ordinance   No.	 2  of	1962,  and  Goa,  Daman	  and	Diu,
    Administration Act 1 of 1962 cured all irregularities of the
    State,	if  any, for the grant of licence.   And  (iv),	 the
    refusal to consider the application affects the	 fundamental
    right of the petitioner to carry on trade and business.
    Rejecting the contentions and dismissing the writ petitions.
    HELD  : (i) The classification of persons with reference  to
    the  grant  of import licence depending on  whether  it	 was
    granted before the liberation or after the liberation of Goa
    is a valid classification based on intelligible	 differentia
    having	a rational nexus with the object of  import  licence
    policy.	  There is no violation of Art. 14.  The  petitioner
    stands	on  a different footing and does not belong  to	 the
    class  of persons who were given import licences during	 the
    Portuguese Rule before liberation of Goa. [872 G-H]
    (ii) The  petitioner  does not challenge  the.	validity  of
    paragraph  3 3 (n) of the Hand Book of Rules  of  Procedure.
    There  is no challenge to the authority of the Deputy  Chief
    Controller  of Imports and Exports to pass an order  in	 the
    light of paragraph 33(n) of the Hand Book. [873 C]
    Really,	 the petitioner's contention is that  the  licensing
    authorities  misapplied or wrongly applied the	Imports	 and
    Exports	 Control Act.  A petition under Art. 32 will not  be
    competent   to	challenge  any	erroneous  decision  of	  an
    authority. [873 D]

    Parliament  has	 power under Art. 246(4) to make  laws	with
    respect to any Union Territory.	 The executive power of	 the
    Union  under Art. 73(1)(a) shall extend to the matters	with
    respect	 to  which Parliament has power to make	 laws.	 The
    Union  Government has, therefore, power to  issue  executive
    directions  to the Administrator of a Union  Territory.	  So
    long  as there is no conflict between a direction issued  by
    the  Central Government and a Presidential  Regulation	made
    under  Art. 240, the Administrator of a Union  Territory  is
    bound  to carry out the orders and directions given  by	 the
    Central Government. [875 G-H]
    Shamsher  Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr., A.I.R. 1974	S.C.
    2192, referred to.
    There  is  no  particular statute or  Portuguese  law  which
    confers any right on the petitioner to get an import licence
    in the circumstances in which it was issued to him.  Even if
    pre-liberation	laws  continued to be in force	with  effect
    from  5	 March, 1962 that would not take away power  of	 the
    Central	 Government  to	 modify	 or  alter  the	 preexisting
    procedure for issuing import licences, after liberation,  in
    exercise  of  its executive powers under Art. 73(1)  of	 the
    Constitution. [876 D]
    (iii)	  Section  3  and  4  of  the  Goa,  Daman  and	 Diu
    (Administration) Ordinance No. 2 of 1961 and Section 4 and 5
    of the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Act No. 1 of 1962
    do not support the case of the petitioner.  These provisions
    in  the	 Ordinance and the Act came into force on  5  March,
    1962.	The import licence was issued on 12  February,	1962
    which is prior to the coming into force of the provisions of
    the Ordinance and the Act.  After the liberation of Goa	 the
    Portuguese  laws  were	not in	force  and,  therefore.	 the
    petitioner  cannot take recourse to the Portuguese laws	 for
    the validity of the licence which was issued on 12 February,
    1962.	 The  Chief  Civil  Administrator  was	 subordinate
    authority  to the Government of India and was bound to	obey
    the  directions of the Central Government.  The Chief  Civil
    Administrator  had  no	authority  to  issue  a	 licence  in
    disregard of the directions of the Central Government.	Such
    a licence would not confer any right on the petitioner. [874
    C-E]
    State  of  Punjab  v. Jagdip Singh,  [1964]  4	S.C.R.	964,
    referred to.
    The  petitioner	 cannot	 draw  any  sustenance	either	from
    section 7 of the Ordinance or section 9 of the Act for three
    reasons.  First. the scope of validation is limited to	such
    acts  which were done in good faith and with the  reasonable
    belief	 that  they  were  necessary  for  peace  and	good
    Government.   The  licence was issued  in  contravention  of
    lawful	directions  given by the Government of	India.	 The
    licence	 was  not issued in good faith or  in  a  reasonable
    belief	that  they  were necessary for the  peace  and	good
    Government  of Goa, Daman and Diu.  Second,  the  validation
    was  riot intended to protect breaches of directions  issued
    by the new sovereign. [874 E-G]
    Pama Chibar v. Union of India, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 357, referred
    to.
    Third,	in the year 1967 the Government of India  laid	down
    the  conditions	 that  imports made  under  licences  issued
    through	 inadvertence  or mistake in the past would  not  be
    considered  for issuing the import quota certificate.	This
    is  a  matter of policy.  The policy decision  is  also	 not
    challenged by the petitioner.  If the policy is followed and
    in  a  given  case  a licence was  issued  contrary  to	 the
    procedure or by mistake or inadvertence the decision in	 the
    year  1968  in the light of the policy	enunciated  in	1967
    cannot	be regarded erroneous simply on the ground that	 the
    original  licence  erroneously	issued	in  1962  might	  be
    validated under s. 7 of the Ordinance. [874 H-875 B]
    Revalidation  was in violation of the terms  and  conditions
    set  out by the Chief Civil Administrator in his Press	Note
    dated  2  April, 1962.	It is not correct to  say  that	 the
    Chief  Civil Administrator revalidated the licence dated  12
    February   1962	  on  28  May,	1962.	 The   Chief   Civil
    Administrator  merely extended the validity of	the  licence
    for  a	further	 period of 90 days.  It is  not	 a  case  of
    revalidation of a defective licence but a case of  extension
    of the duration of the licence. [875 C-D]
    870
    (iv) No materials were shown to establish that the  original
    concern	 was a regular registered importer.  That apart,  no
    person can on the basis of a Policy statement claim a  right
    to the grant of an import licence.  This Court has held that
    there is no absolute right much less a fundamental right, to
    tile grant of an import licence.  In the present case, there
    is no misconstruction of any statutory provision.  It cannot
    be  said  that	there is no authority of law  to  reject  an
    application for import licence. [876 E-E; 877 C-E]

    JUDGMENT:
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition No. 615 of 1970. Petition under Art. 32
of the Constitution of India. Y. S. Chitale, H. N. Ramachandra and B. R.
Agarwala, for the petitioners.
P. P. Rao and S. P. Nayar, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was
delivered by RAY., C. J.-This writ petition is for a mandamus directing the
respondents to cancel for orders mentioned in the petition and to issue quota
certificate to the petitioners in respect of their past imports.
The petitioners are a partnership firm. The petitioners are successors to J.
Fernandes & Company of which Joshino Fernandes was the sole proprietor,
hereinafter referred to as the original concern.
In the month of October, 1961 the original concern booked orders for purchase
of Surveying & Mathematical Instruments and Surgical & Scientific Instruments
with a German firm. The orders were accepted by the German firm, as will
appear from the letter dated 7 November, 1961.
On 19/20 December, 1961 Goa was liberated. Prior Lo the liberation of Goa
import licences were, granted to the citizens of Goa by a Government
Department known as "Junta do Comercio Externo" which means the Board of
External Trade. The original concern is alleged to be an importer registered
with the Junta prior to the month of December, 1961\. After the liberation of
Goa the representatives of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry saw the
Administrator of Goa with regard to applications for import. On 18 January,
1962 the original concern applied to the Administrator of Goa for issuing an
import licence for pound 32,652.10 for Surveying and Mathematical Instruments
and Surgical and Laboratory Equipments, along with necessary papers for firm
commitments.
The original concern obtained a licence on 12 February, 1962\. The licence was
No. 47. The original concern was allowed to import 871 instruments,
microscopes, laboratory apparatus and utensils all worth pound 32,652-10-0.
The original concern opened a letter of credit on 21 February, 1962 for 50 per
cent of the licence.
The Central Government on 21 February, 1962 informed the Administrator, Goa,
that the Central Government withheld action on all pending cases where import
had been authorised. The Central Government gave two reasons. First, the
Government were of the view that any relaxation of, import would result in
serious drain on foreign exchange, and second that it was difficult for any
authority to be satisfied about the firm commitments and some abuse was
possible. Pursuant thereto the Administrator, Goa issued directions to suspend
issue of letter of credit and all cases relating to firm commitments entered
into before 18 December, 1961 which were till then, not disposed of, should be
frozen.
On 2 April, 1962 the Administrator of Goa issued a Press Note that imports
into Goa, Daman and Diu would be governed by three principles. First, import
would be allowed in cases (a) where letters of credits had been opened with
the Banco National Ultra Marines on or before 18 December, 1961;
(b) where goods were shipped on or before 20 December, 1961. Second, imports
of certain specified items were banned. Third, imports would be allowed of
certain goods to the extent of 50 per cent of imports actually made in the
quarter of September, October and November, 1961. The petitioner's licence No.
47 was revalidated on 28 May, 1962 for pound 16,000 for which the petitioner
had not till then opened letter of credit. 27 February, 1962 is the date when
the Administrator of Goa had suspended to issue fresh letter of credit. In the
month of July, 1962 the petitioner effected imports of goods for the full
value. The Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947 was applied to Goa, Daman &
Diu from 1 October, 1963.
In October, 1964 the original concern was taken over by the petitioner.
In 1967 the Hand Book for the year 1967 declared the period 1 April, 1961 to
31 March, 1966 as the basic period and any one year during the period could be
selected as the basic import by the concerned party who would become the
established importers.
On 15 May, 1967 the petitioner applied to the licensing authorities for
recognising the change in the constitution of the firm and fixation of quota
for which they could import the goods. The licensing authorities recognised
the change in the constitution but refused to fix the quota on the ground that
the original licence No. 47 granted to the original concern on 12 February,
1962 was not issued in accordance with the procedure followed for the issue of
licence at that time. The petitioner filed an appeal against the order. The
appeal was rejected. The petitioner filed a review application which was
rejected.
872
The petitioner's grievances are these : First, licence No. 47 dated 12
February, 1962 was a licence issued in accordance with the procedure followed
for the issue of licence at that time. The directions ,of the Central
Government were illegal. The Central Government was not competent to issue
directions to the Administrator of Goa except through the President in view of
Articles 239 and 240 of the Constitution. Second, the provisions of the Goa,
Daman, Diu Administration Ordinance No. 2 of 1961, hereinafter referred to as
the Ordinance and Goa, Daman, Diu Administration Act 1 of 1962 hereinafter
referred to as the Act cured all irregularities of the State, if any, for the
grant of licence. Third, refusal to consider the applica- tion affects the
fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on trade, and business. Fourth,
the petitioner's fundamental right under Article 14 is violated because the
respondents discriminated against the petitioner. The respondents granted
licences to six parties. It is said that the conditions, namely, shipping
before 20 December, 1961 and opening of letters of credit before 18 December,
1961 could only operate in respect of licences issued by the Portuguese
Government. When by reason of policy, these were the conditions applied, the
same should have been applied even to those who were given licences under the
old laws by the Portuguese Government or those who were given licences by the
Administrator of Goa under the operation of the old laws. There is no,
distinction between the cases of the petitioner and the case of six traders
mentioned in Annexure R-4 at page 169.
The contention of the petitioner that six traders have been granted licences
whereas the petitioner was not, and, there was violation under Article 14 is
unacceptable. These six licences were issued before liberation between the
period 12 February, 1961 and 4 December, 1961. The six licences were issued
prior to the liberation of Goa. The liberation of Goa was on 19 December,
1961. On 20 December, 1961 Goa became a Union Territory. The licence on which
the peti- tioner bases the claim was dated 12 February, 1962. The petitioner
was not admittedly issued any licence before the liberation of Goa. Between
the liberation of Goa and the application of the petitioner for licence, the
Government of India issued on 3 January, 1962 to the Chief Civil
Administrator, Goa certain directions regarding the issue of import licence.
The original concern had not opened letter of credit before 18 December, 1961
and the goods in question were not shipped prior to 20 December, 1961. The
application of the petitioner was subsequent to the issue of directions dated
3 January, 1962 by the Government of India that imports would be allowed if
letter of credit had been opened before 18 December, 1961 or shipment had
taken place before 20 December, 1961. The classification of persons with
reference to the grant of import licence depending on whether it was granted
before the liberation or after the liberation of Goa is a valid classification
based on intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object of
import licence policy. There is no violation of Article 14. The petitioner
stands on a different footing and does not belong to the class of persons who
were given import licences during the Portuguese Rule before the liberation of
Goa.
873
The petitioner challenges the orders dated 28 September, 1968 rejecting the
petitioner's application for the issue of a quota certificate. The Government
rejected it on the ground that licence No. 47 dated 12 February, 1962 was not
issued in accordance with the procedure prescribed for issue of licences, at
that time. The Government relied on paragraph 33 (n )of the Hand Book of
Rules, 1968. In short, that paragraph is that licence would be given only for
the basic period between 1 April, 1961 and 31 March, 1966 to established
importers. The Government took the stand that the petitioner is not eligible
because there was no valid licence. The petitioner does not challenge the
validity of any provision of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, or
any provision of any statutory orders issued thereunder. The, petitioner does
not challenge the validity of paragraph 33(n) of the Hand Book of Rules of
Procedure. There is no challenge to the authority of the Deputy Chief
Controller of Imports and Exports to pass an order in the light of paragraph
33(n) of the Hand Book.
Really, the petitioner's contention is that the licensing authorities
misapplied or wrongly applied the Imports and Exports Control Act. A petition
under Article 32 Will not be competent to challenge any erroneous decision of
an authority. (See Gulabdas & Co. v. Assistant Collector of Customs(1) and
State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Mir Gulam Rasul).(2) A wrong application of law
would not amount to a violation of fundamental right. Das, C.J. said in the
case of Gulabdas & Co. (supra) that if the provisions of law are good and the
orders passed are within the jurisdiction of the authorities there is no
infraction of fundamental right if the authorities are right or wrong on
facts. In the case of Gulabdas & Co. (supra) the petitioners challenged the
order of the Assistant Collector of Customs. The Customs authorities assessed
duty under Item 45(4) of the Indian Customs Tariff. The petitioners in that
case contended that the duty should have been assessed under Item 45(a). This
Court held that there was neither any violation of fundamental right under
Article 19 or any unequal treatment and the petition was not maintainable.
This Court in the case of Smt. Ujjam Bai v. State of U.P.(3) as also in the
case of Bhatnagars & Co. Ltd. v. Union of India,(4) held the same view that
any erroneous decision would not be a violation of fundamental rights.
The petitioner relied or sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Goa, Daman & Diu
(Administration) Ordinance 1962. Section 3 of the Ordinance in short stated
that authorities who immediately before the commencement of this Ordinance
were exercising lawful functions in connection with the Administration of Goa,
Daman and Diu or any part thereof shall, unless otherwise directed continue to
exercise in connection with such administration their respective functions.
Section 4 of the Ordinance speaks of continuance of existing laws and their
adaptation until amended or repealed by a competent legislature. Section 7
says that all things done and all actions taken on or after the appointed day

which was 20 December, 1961 and before the commencement of the Ordinance,
viz., 5 March, 1962 by the Administrator or any other officer which have been
done or taken in good faith and in a reasonable belief that they were
necessary for the peace and good Government of Goa, Daman and Diu, shall be as
valid and operative as if they had been done or taken in accordance with law.
The petitioner also relied on sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Act. Section 4 speaks
of officers who before the commencement of the Act were exercising lawful
functions would continue to exercise their respective functions. Section 5 of
the Act speaks of continuance of existing laws and their adaptation until
amended or altered by the competent Legislature. Section 9 of the Act speaks
of validation of certain action and indemnity of officers for certain acts
similar to section 7 of the Ordinance. Sections 3 and 4 of the Goa, Daman and
Diu (Administration) Ordinance No. 2 of 1961 and Sections 4 and 5 of the Goa,
Daman and Diu (Administration) Act No.1 of 1962 do not support the case of the
petitioner. These provisions in the Ordinance and the Act came into force on 5
March, 1962. The import licence was issued on 12 February, 1962 which is prior
to the coming into force of the provisions of the Ordinance and the Act. After
the liberation of Goa the Portuguese laws were not in force and, therefore,
the petitioner cannot take recourse to the Portuguese laws for the validity of
the licence which was issued on 12 February, 1962\. The Chief Civil
Administrator was subordinate authority to the Government of India and was
bound to obey the directions of the Central Government. The Chief Civil
Administrator bad no authority to issue a licence in disregard of the
directions of the Central Government. Such a licence would not confer any
right on the petitioner (See State of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh) The petitioner
cannot draw any sustenance either from section 7 of the Ordinance or section 9
of the Act for three reasons. First, the scope of validation is limited to
such acts which were done in good faith and with the reasonable belief that
they were necessary for peace and good Government. The licence was issued in
contravention of lawful directions given by the Government of India. The
licence was not issued in good faith or in a reason-able belief that they were
necessary for the peace and good Government of Goa, Daman and Diu. Second, the
validation was not intended to protect breaches of directions issued by the
new sovereign. (See Pama Chibar v. Union of India) (2). If the licence dated
12 February, 1962 was validated by section 7 of the Ordinance that validation
would be an answer to any move on the part of the respondents to cancel that
particular licence. What was deemed to be valid by legal fiction for a certain
purpose, notwithstanding the infirmity in granting it, cannot confer any right
on the, petitioner to claim in future as a matter of right, any import quota.
(1) [1964] 4 S.C.R.964.
(2) [1966] 1 S.C.R. 357.

The validation would be only in respect of past transactions. Third,. in the
year 1967 the Government of India laid down the conditions, that imports made
under licences issued through inadvertence or mistake in the past would not be
considered for issuing the import quota certificate. This is a matter of
policy. Norm-ally, courts do not go into such policy decision. The policy
decision is also not challenged by the petitioner. If the policy is followed
and in a given case a licence was issued contrary to the procedure or by
mistake or inadvertence, the decision in the year 1968 in the light of the
policy enunciated in 1967 cannot be- regarded erroneous simply on the ground
that the original licence erroneously issued in 1962 might be validated under
section 7 of the Ordinance. Any revalidation of the licence on 28 May, 1962 by
the Administrator would not assist the petitioner in regard to obtaining quota
rights. On 12 April, 1962 the Administrator himself issued a Press Note
specifying the conditions subject to which imports would be allowed.
Revalidation was in violation of the terms and conditions set out by the Chief
Civil Administrator in his Press Note dated 2 April, 1962\. It is not correct
to say that the Chief Civil Administrator revalidated the licence dated 12
February, 1962 on 28- May, 1962. The Chief' Civil Administrator merely
extended the validity of the licence for a further period of 90 days. It is
not a case of revalidation of a defective licence but a case of extension of
the duration of the licence. If the original licence was defective mere
extension of the duration of the licence could not cure the defect. In any
event, the protection, if any, of the validating section in the Ordinance
would not extend beyond 4 March, 1962 because the acts validated under section
7 of the Ordinance must have been done between 20 December, 1961 and 4 March,
1962.
The directions issued by the Central Government are impeached by the
petitioner to be in violation of Articles 239 and 240 of the Constitution.
Under Article 1(3)(c) of the Constitution, Goa, Daman and Diu became part of
the territory of India by acquisition. Goa, Daman and Diu became a Union
Territory on and from the data of their acquisition by the Government of
lndia. Under Article239(1) a Union Territory shall be administered by the
President acting through an Administrator. Article 240 empowers the President
to make regulations for the peace, progress and good Government of the Union
Territory. In the present case no Presidential Regulation was relied on by
either side. Parliament has power under Article 246(4) to make laws with
respect to any Union Territory. The executive power of the Union under Article
73 (1) (a) shall extend to the matters with respect to which Parliament has
power to make laws. The Union Government has, therefore, power to issue
executive directions to the Administrator of a Union Territory. So long as
there is no conflict between a direc- tion issued by the Central Government
and a Presidential Regulation made under Article 240, the Administrator of a
Union Territory is bound to carry out the orders and directions given by the
Central Government. The decision of this Court in Shamsher Singh v. State 876
of Punjab & Anr.(1) is that the powers conferred on the President by Article
239 are to be exercised by him on the aid and advice of the Cabinet.
Therefore, the directions issued by the Central Government are valid because
of the combined effect of Article 73 and article 246 which confers power on
the Union executive to exercise powers in respect of matters with respect to
which Parliament has competence to make laws.
In the present case, the Chief Civil Administrator himself declared in a Press
Note dated 2 April, 1962 the terms and conditions subject to which import
licence would be granted. The alleged revalidation of licence No. 47 in the
month of May, 1962 took place subsequent to the Press Note and contrary to the
terms and conditions. It was really not a revalidation of the licence but an
extension of the period. If the licence itself was defective, there could not
be any validation of the licence as was contended for by the petitioner.
There is no particular statute or Portuguese law which confers any right on
the petitioner to get an import licence in the circumstances in which it was
issued to him. Even if pre-liberation laws continued to be in force with
effect from 5 March, 1962 that would not take away power of the Central
Government to modify or alter the preexisting procedure for issuing import
licences, after liberation, in exercise of its executive powers under Article
73(1) of the Constitution.
The petitioner contended that the original concern was an importer registered
with the Junta prior to December, 1961. The respondents denied that
allegation. The petitioner in the rejoinder alleged that it is to be presumed
that the original importer must have been registered with the Junta, prior to
the liberation. No materials were shown to establish that the original concern
was a regular registered importer. The contention on behalf of the respondents
that the licence was issued without following the regular procedure and by
inadvertence or mistake is borne by the facts and circumstances of the case
particularly because the Chief Civil Administrator had no authority to issue
any import licences in contravention of the directions of the Central
Government issued on 3 January, 1962. The petitioner relied on the decision of
this Court in M/s. Andhra Industrial Works v. Chief Controller of Imports and
others(2) in support of the proposition appearing at page 1542 of the Report.
The proposition stated there in that one of the instances in relation to laws
regulating the citizen's right to carry on trade or business guaranteed by
Article 19(1) (g) may be catalogued as where the impugned action is based on a
misconstruction of the intra vires statute or is so contrary to the
established procedure or rules of natural justice that it results in violation
of a fundamental right. In the case of M/s. Andhra Industrial Works (supra)
the proposition which was extracted from Ujjambai's case (supra) is that an
order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra
vires, cannot be challenged under Article 32 as repugnant to Article 19 (1)
(g) on the sole (1) A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 2192.
(2) A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1539.
877
ground that it is based on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a
notification issued thereunder. In Ujjambai's case (supra) it was said that
when assessment proceedings are repugnant to rules of natural justice there is
an infringement of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1) (f) and 19 (1)
(g). In support of that proposition reference was made to Tata Iron and Steel
Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar(1), K. T. Moopil Nair v. The State of Kerala(2) and
Shri Madanlal Arora v. The Excise and Taxation Officer(3). In the case of
Andhra Industrial Works. (supra) an objection was raised on behalf of the
respondents that the petition was not competent because there was no violation
of fundamental rights. This Court upheld that objection and said that neither
the Imports and Exports (Control) Act nor any order thereunder was alleged to
be ultra vires nor was the Import Control Policy impeached. A policy statement
was held to be not a statutory document. No person can con the basis of a
policy statement claim a right to the grant of an import licence. This Court,
also held that there is no absolute right much less a fundamental right, to
the grant of an import licence.
This Court in Deputy Assistant Iron and Steel Controller v. L, Manickchand,
Proprietor, Katrella Metal Corporation, Madras(4) held that no one has any
vested right to an import licence in terms of the policy in force at the time
of his application. There is no misconstruction of any statutory provision in
the present case. In the present case, it cannot be said that there is no
authority of law to reject an application for import licence.
For these reasons, the petition fails and is dismissed. Parties will pay and
bear their own costs.
