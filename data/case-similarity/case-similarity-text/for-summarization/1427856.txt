lie. The trust deeds containing such a provision should therefore not be
refused recognition if the other conditions prescribed under the rules are
satisfied.
(vi) Winding up of superannuation fund.- An approved superannuation fund
cannot be wound up unless necessitated by the winding up or discontinuance of
the employer' s trade or under- taking.
(vii) A superannuation fund where rules provide for pension benefits in the
form of' annuity certain' is not entitled for approval, as the same is not
covered under rule 89 of the Income- tax Rules.
(viii) The limit mentioned in rule 80 is in respect of the salary of each
employee taken separately and also in respect of each year of his service
taken separately.
(ix) Approval of superannuation funds which provide for payment of annuities
to an employee or transfer of equitable interest to another approved
superannuation fund when the employee leaves the services voluntarily before
he attains the specified age of retirement may not be refused merely on the
ground that he left the service voluntarily before he reached the age of
normal retirement.
(x) The words' pay' and' salary' should be interpreted alike for all purposes
of the PF Rules since the word' salary' has been defined in the Act and since
contributions to the fund are also being made by the employee members on this
basis, the word pay occurring in the Rules relating to withdrawals should also
be interpreted to have the same meaning as salary.
(xi) Gratuity funds.- Initial contributions to approved gratuity funds may be
permitted to be made in not more than five annual instalments commencing from
the year in which the employee has been admitted to the benefits of the fund.
An application for approval of Gratuity Fund may be made three years after the
establishment of the gratuity fund. In order that the benefits of approval for
the intervening period may not be denied to bona fide funds Commissioners may
after considering all the relevant facts of the case accord approval with
effect from the date from which it satisfies the conditions laid down in rule
3 of Part C of the Fourth Schedule.
(xii) Bad debts.- The suggestion of Chambers of Commerce and the Indian Banks
Association that in the case of Banks the bad debts claimed should be
automatically allowed in their entirety in the assessments of the banks was
not acceptable. Where accounts are kept on mercantile basis, interest thereon
is taxable irrespective of whether the interest is credited to suspense
account or to interest account. The amount of such interest is therefore
includible in the taxable income.[ Instruction No. 1186, dated 20th June, 1978
