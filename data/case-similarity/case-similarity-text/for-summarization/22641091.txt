ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
2\. ITA Nos.6525/Del/2014 filed by the assessee and ITA No.6256/Del/2014 filed
by the Revenue are cross appeals and are directed against the order dated 2nd
September, 2014 of the CIT(A)-20, New Delhi, relating to A.Y. 2008-09. Since
identical grounds have been raised by the assessee and the Revenue in these
cross appeals, therefore, these were heard together and are being disposed of
by this common order.
ITA No.3241/Del/2014 (by the Assessee) & ITA No.3114/Del/2014 (by the Revenue)
(A.Y. 2007-08)
3\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a company engaged in
the business of manufacturing and trading of herbal products of health and
personal care, cosmetics and veterinary products and FMCG products, etc. It
filed its return of income on 26th October, 2007 declaring nil income which
was processed u/s 143(1) of the IT Act. The case of the assessee was selected
for scrutiny and notice u/s 143(2) of the IT Act, 1961 was issued and served
on the assessee on 29th September, 2008. Subsequently, the assessee company
revised its return of income on 18th March, 2009 wherein it revised its book
profit u/s 115JB to Rs.2,80,57,67,940/- as against Rs.263,44,87,072/- declared
earlier. During the course of assessment proceedings, the AO noted that net
profit of Rs. 284,22.30 lakh has been declared from the sales of Rs.1778,02.43
lakh and other income of Rs. 16,51.17 lakh as per copies of audited Profit &
Loss Account, Balance Sheet and its annexures filed along with Audit Report
during the course of assessment proceedings. As per revised 'Computation of
Taxable Income' filed during the  2 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
course of assessment proceedings, after adjusting the brought forward loss and
unabsorbed depreciation of Rs. 24,29,02,607/- in respect of the Assessment
Year 2006-07 out of the total Income Rs. 288,01,87,309/-, the assessee
computed the total income at Rs. 263,72,84,702/- and the assessee company
declared Nil income after claiming total deduction of Rs. 263,72,84,702/- u/s
80IB & 80IC including the deduction of Rs. 2,05,67,500/- u/s 80G. Total
deduction of Rs. 272,09,75,417/- has been worked out u/s 80IB & 801C as per
Audit Reports in Form No. 10CCB filed along with the details of profit and
loss accounts in respect of units eligible for deductions u/s 80IB and 80IC of
the I.T. Act, 1961. The adjusted book profit of Rs. 280 57,67,940/- and tax
payable thereon Rs. 31,48,07,162/- has been computed u/s 115JB as per Annexure
A to Report u/s 115JB of the I.T. Act, 1961 for computing the book profits of
the company in Form No. 29B and computation of taxable income.
4\. Since the assessee has entered into certain international transactions
with its associated enterprises, the AO made a reference u/s 92CA of the Act
to the Transfer Pricing Officer for determination of the ALP of the
international transactions entered into by the assessee with its AEs as per
report in Form No.3CEB u/s 92E of the Act. The TPO proposed an upward
adjustment of Rs.3,95,44,120/- on account of the following:-
> a) Adjustment on account of guarantee - Rs.32,09,600/-
> b) Adjustment on account of interest - Rs.96,67,520/-
3
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
> c) Adjustment on account of royalty - Rs.2,66,67,000/-
5\. The AO accordingly made addition of Rs.3,95,44,120/- on account of TP
adjustment. The AO, in the order passed u/s 143(3) also made various
additions/disallowances and accordingly determined the total income of the
assessee at Rs.13,33,24,890/- and determined the book profit at
Rs.28,05,76,794/-.
6\. The assessee preferred an appeal before the CIT(A) who gave part relief to
the assessee. Aggrieved with such part relief by the CIT(A), the assessee as
well as the Revenue are in appeal before the Tribunal by raising the following
grounds:-
> ITA No.3241/Del/2014 (by assessee) (A.Y. 2007-08) "1) That the TPO has no
> jurisdiction to determine arms length price in respect of the transactions
> not referred u/s 92CA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act).
> 2) That the CIT (Appeals) has erred in sustaining the addition to the extent
> of 0.50% alleged to have been charged as service fee for the corporate
> guarantee given by the appellant to Dabur Egypt on various factual and legal
> grounds.
> 3) That without prejudice to Ground No. 2 above, giving of corporate
> guarantee is not the international transaction by which the concerned AE has
> been benefited and accordingly the addition to the extent of 0.50% in
> respect of the service fee alleged to have been charged on the corporate
> guarantee given to Dabur Egypt is arbitrary and bad in law.
> 4) That in the absence of any contract as existing during the year between
> the assessee and three AEs, neither any royalty accrued during the" year nor
> can it be presumed to be receivable and consequently the order of the TPO
> and sustained by the CIT (Appeals) are without any basis/material and are
> based on surmises and conjectures not permissible under the law.
5) That the TPO and CIT (Appeals) failed to consider the geographical
conditions of working of Dabur International UAE, Dabur Nepal and Asian
Consumer Care Ltd., Bangladesh having no substantial awareness about the Dabur
brand in the area and consequently the presumption and assumption  4 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 about the chargeability of royalty by
invoking the provision of Section 92 of the Act from Dabur International UAE,
Dabur Nepal and Asian Consumer Care Ltd., Bangladesh is arbitrary, unjust and
without any basis.
6) That the CIT (Appeals) and TPO have failed to consider that in the absence
of any expenditure incurred by the assessee for the establishment of brand in
the geographical area of working of Dabur International UAE, Dabur Nepal and
Asian Consumer Care Ltd., Bangladesh, no royalty can be said to have accrued
to the assessee when Dabur International UAE, Dabur Nepal and Asian Consumer
Care Ltd., Bangladesh have incurred expenses on advertisement and sales
promotion in their respective area for promotion of the brand which amounts to
the services provided by AEs to the assessee for building the brand and
consequently the addition as made by the TPO and sustained by the CIT
(Appeals) in respect of the alleged royalty chargeable from Dabur
International UAE , Dabur Nepal and Asian Consumer Care Ltd., Bangladesh is
arbitrary, unjust and at any rate very excessive.
7) That in absence of any comparable transaction necessary for the
determination of Arm length Price, the alleged royalty sustained by CIT
(Appeal) @ 2% on eligible sales in case of Dabur International, Dabur Nepal
Pvt. Ltd. and Asian Consumer Care Ltd., Bangladesh is arbitrary, unjust and
any rate very excessive
8) That the above grounds of appeal are independent and without prejudice to
one another.
Your appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend or withdraw any of the
grounds of appeal at the time of hearing."
ITA No.3114/Del/2014 (by the Revenue) (A.Y. 2007-08) "1\. On the fact and in

raised above at the time of the hearing."
7\. The grounds of appeal No.1 and 8 by the assessee being general in nature
are dismissed. The ld. Counsel did not press ground of appeal No.3 for which
the ld. DR has no objection. Accordingly, ground of appeal No.3 is also
dismissed as not pressed.

ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
8\. Ground of appeal No.2 by the assessee and grounds of appeal No.1 and 2 by
the Revenue relate to part relief given by the CIT(A) out of the addition of
Rs.32,09,600/- made by the AO on account of corporate guarantee.
9\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the TPO, during the course of TP
assessment proceedings noted that the assessee has given following corporate
guarantee on behalf of its AE:-
a) Guarantee for Rs.312.50 lakhs on behalf of Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd.; and
b) Guarantee for Rs.489.90 lakhs on behalf of Dabur Egypt Ltd.
10\. The TPO noted that the assessee has not charged any amount for providing
the corporate guarantee to its AEs. Further, the transaction has been
benchmarked using TNMM and has been aggregated with the transactions of sale
of finished goods. The plea of the assessee that such corporate guarantee is
not an international transaction was rejected by the TPO. Rejecting the
various explanations given by the assessee and observing that the assessee has
exposed itself to a big risk by providing corporate guarantee for which the
assessee has not charged any amount from the AE, the TPO adopted 4.05% on the
value of bank guarantee and, accordingly, proposed an upward adjustment of
Rs.32,09,600/- by observing as under:-
> "8.8 In view of the above discussions, there are two CUP rates available (i)
> the external CUP in which the State Bank of India has provided a rate of
> 2.75% and (ii) an internal CUP in which the assessee has stated that HSBC
> has charged a rate of 1.25% for providing the bank guarantee to the
> assessee. In the facts and circumstances of the case I am inclined to take
> mean of two available rates. The mean of two available CUP rates work out to
> 2%. This  7 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 rate of 2% is further
> enhanced by 200 basis points being the adjustment for the risk that the
> assessee is bearing. Detailed discussion in this regard has been done in the
> preceding paragraph. The working of the Corporate Guarantee charges is made
> as below:
          Value of Bank Guarantee                    Rs. 802.40 Lacks
          Charges @4.00% as discussed above          Rs. 3,209,600
> I therefore determine the arm's length price of providing the services by
> the assessee in the shape of bank guarantee to AE at Rs. 3,209,600/-. An
> upward adjustment of Rs. 3,209,600/- is made on this account. Since the
> assessee has not charged any amount on account of providing the guarantee,
> the amount of Rs. 3,209,600/- is more than 5% of the value of international
> transaction."
11\. The AO accordingly made the addition of Rs.32,09,600/-.
12\. In appeal, the ld.CIT(A) directed the AO to adopt 0.5% as service fee for
corporate guarantee given by the assessee to Dabur Egypt. He, however, held
that no service fee towards corporate guarantee can be charged for the
corporate guarantee in case of Dabur Nepal. The finding of the CIT(A) on this
issue from paras 6.1 to 6.5 are as under:-
"6.0 Finding:
6.1 I have carefully considered the submissions made by the appellant The Ld.
AO has observed that the Appellant has failed to charge service fees for the
corporate guarantee given to bank for availing loan facility by its AEs namely
Dabur Nepal and Dabur Egypt. The ALP for service fee for providing corporate
guarantee has been computed at 4.00% by the Ld. AO/TPO against NIL rate
charged by the Appellant The Appellant contended that in view of Four Soft
Ruling of Hyderabad Tribunal, corporate guarantee is not an international
transaction. However, this point of Appellant is not valid in view of the
amendment brought by the Finance Act, 2012 with retrospective effect from
1-4-2002, by way of Explanation to Section 92B, guarantee commission is now
considered to be an international transaction. However, the Appellant further
relied upon recent ruling of Bharti Airtel Ltd of Delhi ITAT- I Bench wherein
it has been categorically held, that issuance of corporate guarantee is not an
international transaction even after amendment. I have considered this point
of the Appellant and the ruling relied upon, it seems there cannot be any
denying of the fact that the foreign AE could not have either availed loan or
8 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 would have availed at varying terms
had the corporate guarantee was not provided by the appellant. Even otherwise,
the Appellant would not have provided corporate guarantee to an unrelated
person without charging service fee. Thus, the point that the foreign AE had
implicitly received benefit by parent company's corporate guarantee cannot be
denied. Moreover, in case of Bharti Airtel Ltd., the corporate guarantee was
not activated which essentially means that corporate guarantee was non-
existent. Thus, proposition laid down in Bharti Airtel case is not applicable
to present case as essential facts are distinguishable. Now, the definition of
international transaction given in section 92B r.w. explanation (i) (c)
categorically includes 'guarantee' as one of means of capital financing.
Therefore, guarantee in context of international transaction means providing
of non funding support tc the other person whether there is a cost or not to
be incurred by the guarantor. The feet that the guarantor took a risk in
proving such a guarantee cannot be totally overlooked. Given the risk, there
is possibility of impact on profit, losses, assets or liabilities of
guarantor. No person will assume this risk without being adequately secured
and demanding some form of return. Accordingly, I hold that issuance of
corporate guarantee is an international transaction and ALP is required to be
computed u/s 92.
6.2 It now clearly emerges that providing guarantee is an international
transaction and it needs to be benchmarked as per provisions of section 92(1).
The Appellant had charged NIL rate for providing the corporate guarantee and
in its TP study report, has justified arm's length compliance by following
TNMM. The appellant has taken a position that provision of corporate guarantee
is integral part of sale transactions and hence it need not be separately
benchmarked However, the appellant has not explained how this transaction of
providing corporate guarantee is part and parcel of sales transactions, I
therefore, do not agree with such approach of the appellant because provision
of corporate guarantee is not at all linked with sales transactions and it
being an independent transaction, can not be clubbed with sale transactions
and need to be benchmarked separately. The TPO has rejected approach of the
appellant and has applied CUP as most appropriate method. The TPO has gathered
information from bank (SBI) regarding bank guarantee commission charged by the
bank. The TPO has taken mean of rate of bank guarantee charged by SBI (2.75%)
as per information obtained u/s 133(6) and rate of bank guarantee actually
charged by HSBC (1.25%) from the appellant. To the average rate of 2%, TPO
further added 200 basis points to account for risks assumed by the appellant.
Accordingly, TPO worked out ALP of corporate guarantee @ 4%. Even the approach
followed by TPO does not appear to be quite reasonable. Strictest
comparability norms as required for applying CUP have not been satisfied. In
present case, the appellant has given corporate guarantee to a foreign bank
for providing loan to its foreign AE in foreign currency. The situation
adopted by the TPO in CUP method is of Indian bank giving guarantee in India
for amount in INR. Bank guarantee and corporate guarantee are also not
identical instruments. In corporate guarantee,  9 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 primary liability is of borrower and liability of guarantor
arises only in case of default on part of borrower. In case of bank guarantee,
liability is only of the person who has obtained bank guarantee. Moreover, in
present case, concerned banks HSBC Bank Egypt and NABIL bank Nepal whereas TPO
has used data obtained from SBI and HSBC India and it is very likely that
rates charged by the banks are quite different.
6.3 To support its contention for lower charge of corporate guarantee fees,
the Appellant has submitted information obtained from foreign banks. The
Appellant submitted that letters from the banks (HSBC Egypt and NABIL, NEPAL)
reveal as to what tangible benefit was derived by the Overseas AEs out of
corporate guarantee provided by the appellant. As per the letter from NABIL
Nepal, there was no interest saving in case of Dabur Nepal and hence there
cannot be allegation of service fees towards corporate guarantee. As regards,
Dabur Egypt a savings of 0.60% is obtained from EGP Loan of 3550000/- and a
miniscule interest savings for UDS loan of 473000. The appellant contended
that the entire interest savings cannot be solely attributed as service fee
due from its overseas AEs because oversee AEs do have their own credit rating
and negotiating power with the banks.
6.4 I have carefully examined the submission of the Appellant and other
evidences placed on record. As regards Dabur Nepal, NABIL Bank stated that it
would not have charged any extra interest with or without corporate guarantee.
This is evidence directly from the bank concerned and hence cannot be ignored.
Further, it has been noted that corporate guarantee has been released on 27th
July 2006. This means that corporate guarantee provided by the appellant
remained in operation only for four months period comprised in FY under
consideration. Hence, with respect to Dabur Nepal, I hold that no service fees
towards corporate guarantee can be charged. Hence, I direct the AO to delete
the additions made on account of corporate guarantee in case of Dabur Nepal.
6.5 In case of Dabur Egypt, the letter from HSBC Bank states the loan facility
was available to Dabur Egypt at a rate of 11.90% for Egyptian loan with
corporate guarantee versus 12.50% without corporate guarantee. However, it is
noted that rates as mentioned by the bank pertain to the period of December
2011 when Dabur Egypt requested for release of corporate guarantee The bank
has itself mentioned that rates have undergone change several times during the
prevalent period. This means that differential of 0.6% interest rate cannot be
as such applied to, the period under consideration. In the absence of exact
information for the relevant period, it would be reasonable to consider
differential of 1.0% which could be attributed to provision of corporate
guarantee by the appellant Further, as contended by the Appellant, the
difference of 1.0% cannot be solely attributed as service fee due to
Appellant. This is because some degree of bargaining between parties always
remains in the trade and accordingly a split of 50:50 seems more  10 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 appropriate. In light of the same, I hold
that 0.50% should have been charged as service fee for the corporate guarantee
given by the Appellant to Dabur Egypt and this shall be in line with various
judicial decisions referred supra on the issue. I, accordingly direct the AO
to recompute the ALP for corporate guarantee fee as per directions given
above. The grounds of appeal are partly allowed."
13\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the assessee as well as the
Revenue are in appeal before the Tribunal.
14\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee has not
charged any service fee on corporate guarantee due to the following reasons:-
(a) The loans obtained by the foreign associated enterprises of the assessee
were secured loans having a charge against the assets of AEs and other
collateral offered by AEs.
(b) The assessee had given corporate guarantee on behalf of AEs only to
provide an additional cover against the loans obtained
(c) Given the strong financial position of AEs and future projections, on the
basis of which loans were sanctioned by foreign bank, there was not even a
minimal chance of default on part of AEs, even in the absence of corporate
guarantee.
(d) No cost was incurred by the assessee for providing corporate guarantee to
foreign banks and accordingly, no service fee was charged from the AEs.
(e) To avoid any risk involved, the corporate guarantee provided by the
assessee was further secured by way of back to back guarantee in case of
default in loan repayment by foreign AEs to the foreign banks. Besides, the
back to back  11 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 guarantee, the
assessee also reserved the right to receive interest for period of default in
excess of 2% of prevailing bank interest.
(f) Loan advanced by the bank to AEs was not on the basis of corporate
guarantee given by the assessee to the bank. Further, the AE got no
significant advantage of lower rate of interest from bank if assumption of
benefit of corporate guarantee is considered. The loan given by bank was on
pure financial consideration of the AE concerned. The bank has secured the
loan by way of charge of assets of the borrower. He accordingly submitted that
no service fee was charged by the assessee from its AEs on account of issue of
corporate guarantee.
15\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that in case of corporate
guarantee due to lack of external comparable transactions, one has to deploy a
method to determine the economic benefit arising from the financial guarantee.
There is guidance provided by foreign revenue authorities which have held that
the yield or the "interest saved" could be an appropriate method to quantify
the economic benefit arising from the financial guarantee. He submitted that
the yield approach involves estimating the rate at which the borrower would
obtain funds on a stand-alone basis on a given date and compare this interest
rate with the interest rate at which it would obtain funds on the same date
and on same/similar terms, but with a parental credit guarantee. The
difference between these two interest rates represents savings arising out of
the guarantee arrangement which represents a quantification of both the
benefit that the guaranteed entity receives from the  12 ITA Nos.3241, 3114,
6525 & 6256/Del/2014 guarantee and the incremental risk that the guarantor
incurs in providing the guarantee. However, the entire savings may not be
passed on to the guarantor since, the borrower in such a case will not have
any incentive to ask for a guarantee if it does not receive any benefit. He
submitted that during the financial year 2006- 07, the assessee had provided
corporate guarantee on behalf of its AEs. To evaluate whether a guarantee fee
is chargeable by the assessee to its associated enterprises, one may apply the
yield approach.
16\. So far as the Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal is concerned, he submitted
that the assessee had issued corporate guarantee to NABIL Bank, Nepal, against
the loan of Nepalese Rs.6 crores obtained by Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal.
Such guarantee was for a short duration which was thereafter released on 27th
July, 2006. He submitted that there was no interest savings on account of
corporate guarantee issued by the assessee. Referring to page 346 of the paper
book, the ld. Counsel drew the attention of the Bench to the letter filed by
the assessee dated 31.10.2013 obtained from NABIL Bank, Nepal, wherein the
bank has stated that corporate guarantee provided by the assessee, in no way,
influenced the interest charged by the bank to Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
Accordingly, there was no benefit accruing to Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. on account
of issuance of corporate guarantee. Such guarantee was given only to provide
an extra cover and did not, in any way, impact the interest rates charged by
the bank. He accordingly submitted that the CIT(A) has rightly held that in
absence of any savings/benefit, no service fee can be  13 ITA Nos.3241, 3114,
6525 & 6256/Del/2014 attributed to corporate guarantee issued by the assessee
on behalf of Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
17\. So far as the corporate guarantee issued to Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt is
concerned, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee had
issued corporate guarantee of 4.899 crores (EGP 3.55 Million) to HSBC Bank,
Egypt, SAE against the loan of EGP 3.55 Million and USD 450,000 raised by
Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt. He submitted that such guarantee was released in the
year 2011\. Referring to page 345 of the paper book, the ld. Counsel for the
assessee drew the attention of the Bench to the letter dated 11th September,
2013 issued by HSBC Bank, Egypt SAE and submitted that in the said letter, on
account of release of corporate guarantee requested by Dabur Egypt, the bank
increased the interest rate from 11.90% to 12.5%. Therefore, as per the said
letter, the incremental interest saved due to guarantee provided by the
assessee was 0.60%. However, since the benefit of an explicit guarantee
accrued to both the guarantor and the borrower, the interest benefit should
ideally be split between the parties to the transaction i.e., the borrower and
the guarantor. He submitted that usually as a rule of thumb the interest
benefit is split between the guarantor and the borrower on 50:50 basis which
is considered to be the most equitable share of benefits. Applying the
aforesaid rule, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the benefit
that can be attributed to the service fee on account of corporate guarantee
could at the most be 0.30%. He accordingly submitted that the action of the
14 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 CIT(A) in charging service fee at
an ad hoc rate of 0.5% should be reversed and may be restricted to 0.30%.
18\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, heavily relied on the order of the AO. He
submitted that the AO has correctly computed the adjustment on account of
guarantee fee at Rs.32,09,600/- and the ld.CIT(A), without any valid reasons,
has held that no service fee towards corporate guarantee could be charged in
the case of Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and he has erroneously and under
misconception has reduced such corporate guarantee issued on behalf of Dabur
Egypt, Egypt to 0.50%.
19\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO/TPO/CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We
find, the assessee, during the relevant assessment year, has issued the
following corporate guarantees on behalf of its associated enterprises.
15
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
20\. We find, the TPO computed the notional guarantee fee @ 4% on the basis of
data obtained from State Bank of India u/s 133(6) of the Act and calculated as
under:-
              Particulars                           Rate (in%)
              External CUP rate - SBI rate          2.75
              Internal CUP rate - HSBC rate         1.75
              Mean of CUP rates                     2
              Add: Risk Adjustment                  2
              Rate                                  4
21\. Accordingly, the TPO made adjustment of Rs.32,09,600/- being 4% of
corporate guarantee given to the tune of Rs.8.02 crore to the total income of
the assessee on the ground that the assessee ought to have charged service
fee/commission on providing such corporate guarantee on behalf of its AEs. We
find, in appeal, the ld.CIT(A) deleted the commission chargeable on guarantee
issued on behalf of Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., on the ground that there was no
interest savings on account of corporate guarantee given to Dabur Nepal Pvt.
Ltd. and further such guarantee was in operation only for a period of four
months. Therefore, no service fee towards corporate guarantee could be charged
in such case and accordingly deleted the addition of notional service fee made
by the AO in case of Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd..
21.1. So far as the guarantee issued on behalf of Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt is
concerned, although the ld.CIT(A) appreciated that interest savings on account
of corporate guarantee was restricted to 0.60% only, but, proceeded to
consider an ad  16 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 hoc rate of 1%
towards corporate guarantee out of which 50% was attributed towards service
fee. Accordingly, he determined the service fee on account of corporate
guarantee at 0.50% as against 4% adopted by the TPO and deleted the balance
addition made by the AO. It is the submission of the ld. Counsel that no cost
or expenses have been incurred by the assessee for issue of corporate
guarantee in favour of its AEs. It is also his submission that the loans
obtained for the foreign AEs of the assessee were secured loans having a
charge against the assets of the AEs and other collaterals offered by AEs. The
assessee had given corporate guarantee on behalf of AEs only to provide an
additional cover against the loans obtained and, therefore, no addition is
called for.
22\. We find some force in the above arguments advanced by the ld. Counsel. So
far as the corporate guarantee to NABIL Bank,, Nepal against the loan of
Nepalese Rs.6 crores obtained for Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal for which the
assessee had issued a corporate guarantee is concerned, we find, such
guarantee was for a short duration of four months which was thereafter
released on 27th July, 2006, a fact not disputed by the Revenue. The
submission of the ld. Counsel for the assessee that there was no interest
savings on account of corporate guarantee issued by the assessee also remains
uncontroverted since the letter filed by the assessee dated 31.10.2013 from
NABIL Bank, Nepal, copy of which is placed at page 346 of the paper book
clearly shows that the corporate guarantee provided by the assessee in no way
influenced the interest charged by the bank to Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.  17
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Under these circumstances, we find no
infirmity in the order of the ld.CIT(A) that in absence of any savings/benefit
no service fee could be attributed to corporate guarantee issued by the
assessee on behalf of Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
23\. So far as corporate guarantee issued on behalf of Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt
is concerned, we find the assessee had issued corporate guarantee of Rs.4.899
crores (EGP 3.55 million) to HSBC Bank, Egypt, SAE against the loan of EGP
3.55 Million and USD 4,50,000/- raised by Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt. A perusal
of the letter dated 11th September, 2013 issued by HSBC Bank, Egypt, SAE copy
of which is placed at page 345 of the paper book shows that on account of
release of corporate guarantee requested for by Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt, the
bank increased the interest rate from 11.90% to 12.50%. Thus, an inference can
be drawn from the said letter that the incremental interest saved due to
guarantee provided by the assessee was 0.60%. We find merit in the argument of
the ld. Counsel for the assessee that the benefit of an explicit guarantee
accrue to both the guarantor and the borrower, therefore, the interest benefit
should be split between the parties to the transaction, i.e., the borrower and
the guarantor and as per rule of thumb such benefit should be in 50:50 basis.
Although the ld.CIT(A) has attributed 50% of such savings as the service fee
on account of guarantee, however, he had taken the savings on interest due to
such guarantee provided by the assessee at 1%. Under these circumstances, we
find merit in the argument of the ld. Counsel that charging of service fee at
an ad hoc rate of 0.5% should be reversed and may be restricted to  18 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 0.30% in respect of corporate guarantee
issued to Dabur Egypt Ltd., as against 0.5% held by the CIT(A). Thus, the
ground raised by the Revenue on this issue is dismissed and the ground raised
by the assessee is partly allowed.
24\. Grounds No.4 to 7 by the assessee and Grounds No.4 and 5 by the Revenue
relates to the part relief granted by the CIT(A) on account of royalty
adjustment.
25\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the TPO, during the course of TP
assessment proceedings noted that the assessee has not received any royalty
from its AEs. He noted from the records that in the assessment year 2005-06
and 2006- 07, the assessee had received royalty from Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd.,
Dabur International, UAE and Asian Consumer Care P. Ltd., Bangladesh, the
details of which are as under:-
    Company                           Royalty received Royalty        Royalty received
                                      in AY 2005-06 received in AY in AY 2007-08

    Bangladesh
    Dabur International UAE                     164.41              --         --
25.1 The TPO referred to the agreement entered into by the assessee with its
AEs for receipt of royalty. On being confronted by the AO regarding non-
charging of any royalty from its AEs, the assessee submitted its objections
which the TPO has summarized and which are as under:-
> · The assessee does not have any contractual obligation to receive the
> royalty.
19
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 · The agreement with Dabur Nepal
> has been terminated in May, 2005 and hence Dabur Nepal is under no
> obligation to pay the royalty.
> · The agreement with Dabur International, UAE has expired in April, 2005 and
> hence Dabur International is under no obligation to pay the royalty.
> · Since there is no contractual obligation, no royalty can be received from
> the AEs. The assessee has placed reliance on the decision of High Court of
> Delhi in the case of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.
> · The AEs are developing marketing intangible by way of extensive
> advertisement By virtue of spending huge money on advertisement and
> publicity the AEs are directly or indirectly promoting the brand name of the
> assessee. The assessee has placed reliance on the decision of High Court of
> Delhi in the case of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.
> · It has been argued that the foreign AEs are not directly benefited by the
> use of Dabur brand and hence there is no justification of as to payment of
> royalty by the AEs.
> · Had the AEs not been promoting the brand name of Dabur, the assessee
> company would have incurred substantial amount on advertisement as compared
> to the notional royalty receivable from the AEs.
26\. However, the TPO was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the
assessee. He analysed the various agreements entered into by the assessee with
its AEs and held that the AEs have used the trade name/brand name owned by the
20 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 assessee without any compensation.
He, therefore, computed the arm's length price of the royalty for use of the
brand name on the basis of the data available. From the details furnished by
the assessee regarding the value of sales made to the AEs, the TPO computed
the arm's length price of the royalty at Rs.266.67 lakhs the details of which
are as under:-
    Company                       FOB Sales Royalty             Royalty shown       Difference
                                  Rs. in Lakhs Rs. in Lakhs     in the books of     Rs. in Lakhs
                                                                accounts
    Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd Nepal            2148          161.10                NIL            161.10
    Dabur International UAE              1129           33.87                NIL              33.87
                                                                                .
    Asian Consumer Care Limited          1195           71.70                NIL              71.70
                                                       266.67                               266.67
27\. The AO accordingly made addition of the same to the total income of the
assessee.
28\. Before the CIT(A), it was submitted that the assessee had taken the value
of royalty as NIL following its consistent position post FY 2004-05. It was
submitted that after 31st March 2005, the assessee had stopped charging
royalty from Dabur Nepal and Dabur International owing to change in the
business arrangement w.e.f. 01-04-2005. However, the AO, following its earlier
order for AY 2006-07, proposed to charge royalty at the old and controlled
rates. In doing so, the AO violated the basic principle of transfer pricing
i.e., comparison of controlled transaction with the uncontrolled transaction.
It was argued that even if the AO had to apply the royalty rates, such rate
arrived at should have been uncontrolled for  21 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 the purposes of transfer pricing. It was argued that the AO/TPO,
without going into the merits of this year's case, proceeded to make
adjustment on the basis of previous year. It was brought to the notice of the
ld. CIT(A) that his predecessor has decided the issue partly in favour of the
assessee and allowed relief the details of which are as follows:
> S. Name of AE Rate levied by TPO in Rate as per CIT(A) order No. order of AY
> 2007-08 of AY 2006-07
> 1\. Dabur Nepal P Ltd 7.50% 2%
> 2\. Dabur International Ltd 3% 2%
> 3\. Asian Consumer Care 6% Not Applicable Limited, Bangladesh
29\. The various clauses of the agreement with the AE were brought to the
notice of the CIT(A). It was argued that the assessee has not charged royalty
from Dabur International Ltd., UAE, Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd. and Asian Consumer
Care Limited, Bangladesh as there was no legally enforceable agreement with
them. Therefore, in absence of any contractual obligation between the parties,
a right to receive royalty cannot be unilaterally be made by the assessee.
30\. Based on the extensive arguments advanced by the assessee and relying on
various decisions, the ld.CIT(A) held that the use of brand name by AEs is an
international transaction, the arm's length price of which is assessed u/s 92
of the Act. The ld.CIT(A), however, reduced the amount of royalty. So far as
Dabur International Ltd., UAE is concerned, he observed that the products
manufactured by Dabur International Ltd, UAE are different from those
manufactured in India  22 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 and in some
cases, even the raw material is different. Further, most of the products
manufactured in UAE are manufactured without technical support from India.
Accordingly, he reduced the rate of royalty (i.e., 3%) charged by the TPO to
2% and restricted the arm's length price adjustment at Rs.22.58 lakhs. So far
as Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal is concerned, he observed that (a) Rate of 3%
is mentioned in the amended agreement; and (b) the assessee could not meet its
obligation to bear entire marketing expenses and therefore, Dabur Nepal Pvt.
Ltd, Nepal did not pay any royalty. He accordingly applied the same rate of
royalty of 2% as in case of Dabur International Ltd, UAE and restricted the
arm's length price from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. at Rs.42.96 lakhs. So far as
Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh is concerned, the CIT(A) observed
that (a) no evidence has been furnished by the assessee to demonstrate that no
technology was provided to Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd.; and (b) the
associated enterprise has continued to use the brand name of Dabur. He
accordingly applied the same rate of royalty of 2% as applied in case of Dabur
Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and Dabur International Ltd, UAE and restricted the arm's
length price from Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd. at Rs.23.90 lakhs.
31\. The relevant observations of the ld.CIT(A) from para 12 to 12.9.5 of his
order read as under:-
"12.0 FINDING:
12.1 I have carefully gone through various contentions raised by the appellant
and other material placed on record. The relevant facts are that the appellant
(Dabur India) is legal owner  23 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 of
brand 'Dabur' and other sub-category brands like 'Vatika', 'Hajmola' etc.
Overseas AE's of the appellant had been using Dabur India's trademarks and
trade names. Upto FY 2004-05, the appellant was getting royalty payments from
its AE's, whereas during FY 2006-07, appellant did not receive any royalty.
12.2 The case of the appellant is that the agreements under which royalty was
received in earlier period were no longer in existence. Moreover, the overseas
AE's are incurring substantial expenses for brand promotion in their
respective territories and therefore there is no payment of royalty. In order
u/s 92CA(3), the TPO computed arm's length price of royalty as under:

12.3 The TPO computed arm's length royalty by applying rate of royalty as
mentioned in agreement dated 05.11.1992 with Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd., Nepal and
dated 01.04.2003 with Dabur International Ltd., UAE and dated 01.02.1993 with
Asian Consumer Care (P) Limited Bangladesh. 12.4 The contentions of the
appellant have been duly considered. The simple fact is that the appellant has
allowed it AE in Nepal, UAE and Bangladesh to use its brand name but no
royalty has been charged from them. This cannot be the situation in case of
transaction between independent parties. This is an international transaction
the price of which is to be determined u per transfer pricing regulation u/s
92 of the Act. In present case, the appellant has taken price of the said
international transaction at Nil. But according to section 92(1), income
arising from such international transaction has to be computed having regards
to arm's length price. Whether there is any contractual basis of receipt of
royalty income or nor is not relevant for computing income arising from such
international transaction having regards to arm's length price. As in the
present case, if there no agreement to get any royalty income in return for
permitting the use of brand name, it does not mean that transfer pricing
regulation shall not apply. Therefore, quantum of income arising from an
international transaction has to be computed having regards to arm's length
price and it does not depend upon existence or otherwise of agreement to get
royalty income. Hence contention of the appellant that in absence of an  24
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 operative agreement for getting
royalty income, a notional royalty cannot be assessed under TP regulations is
not legally tenable.
12.5 Undisputedly, Dabur India is legal owner of brand name 'Dabur' and other
sub-brands and Dabur Nepal, Dabur UAE and Dabur Bangladesh which are AEs of
Dabur India have been permitted by Dabur India to use its brand names. The
appellant has contended that Dabur Nepal, Dabur UAE and Dabur Bangladesh have
spent significant AMP expenses (advertisement, marketing and promotional
expenses) and therefore 'Dabur' brand is being built up in foreign territories
by the efforts of AEs of the appellant and hence in fact AEs are providing
service to the appellant for which AEs need to be remunerated. However, no
remuneration for such services is being given to AEs and accordingly no
royalty is being charged from them because if such remuneration is taken into
account, it will exceed the royalty chargeable and hence income of the
appellant shall further go down. The appellant has further argued that even
otherwise, the value of brand 'Dabur' is not very significant as no state of
art technology is involved in manufacturing process of products involved.
These contentions of the appellant have been duly considered. Firstly, it
cannot be said that value of brand 'Dabur' is Nil as no royalty has been
accounted for by the appellant. There must be some value of the brand for
which royalty income has to be determined having regards to arm's length
price. Secondly, the appellant has not established that AE in Nepal, UAE and
Bangladesh are incurring abnormal AMP expenses which exceed 'Bright Line
Test'. The appellant has not established its view by giving figures of AMP in
case of comparables operating in respective geographical locations. The
appellant has not established that tax authorities of Nepal, UAE and
Bangladesh have held such AMP expenses as exceeding bright line. Upto AY
2005-06, the appellant has been receiving royalty income from its AEs. The
appellant could not establish that after AY 2005-06, its AMP expenses have
decreased and AMP expenses of its AEs have increased substantially which may
point towards appellant's case that its AEs are doing brand building efforts
and hence providing service to it. Therefore, appellant's contention that
ratio of recent decision of Hon'ble Delhi ITAT in case of LG Electronics India
Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No. 5140/Del/2011) is applicable in its case is not factually
and legally tenable. The appellant has further argued that foreign AEs did not
derive any benefit by use its trade mark/trade name. This contention of the
appellant is superfluous as AEs could be the best judge to decide whether they
need support of Dabur Logo or not. If they are not befitted by the
arrangement, nobody is forcing them to continue with it.
12.6 Now the question arises what should be the quantum of royalty having
regards to arm's length price. The appellant has not provided any comparables
so as to justify its nil royalty income. The TPO has relied upon royalty
agreements entered into by the appellant with its AEs to arrive at arm length
price. The reasoning given by TPO is two fold. Firstly, royalty agreements
under which the appellant had been received royalty income upto AY 2005-06  25
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 are operative during the year under
consideration as there is no evidence that these agreements have been
terminated. Secondly, without prejudice, even if it is assumed that these
agreements are not operative during period under consideration, royalty
chargeable as per these agreements represents arm's length price as per TP
regulations. In view of various contentions of the appellant and reasoning
given-by TPO, royalty issue in respect of both AEs involved is being discussed
in following paragraphs.
12.7 Dabur International Ltd., UAE The appellant has entered into an agreement
dated 01.04.2003 with Redrock Ltd (presently Dabur International Ltd.) which
inter-alia provided for technical and R&D support, know-how, information,
operational improvements and skills in area of cost management, manufacturing,
production procurement, sale marketing and distribution of products. It also
permitted Redrock to use Dabur logo on both products manufactured by using
Dabur's technology and know-how and also products manufactured by its without
Dabur's know-how. As per clause 4 of the agreement, Dabur India Ltd. is
entitled to royalty of 3% of FOB sales of Redrock of Dabur branded products
which are manufactured using Dabur's know how and 1% of FOB sales of Dabur
branded products manufactured without using technical and R&D support from
Dabur. Based on this, the TPO has computed royalty chargeable from Dabur
International Ltd. @ 3% of sales while the appellant has not declared any
royalty income, The appellant has contended that w.e.f. 01,04,2005, this
agreement has been terminated and has furnished letters dated 07.04.2005 and
01.02.2013. the appellant has further contended that Dabur International was
not sourcing any technical knowhow from Dabur India for its products
manufactured in UAE and has furnished letters dated 18.07,2011 and 20.07.2011
which state that products manufactured by Dabur International Ltd in UAE are
different from those manufactured in India and no technical support from Dabur
India is being taken for the purpose.
12.7.1 The applicant has argued that agreement with Dabur International has
become inoperative w.e.f. 01.04.2005 and hence there was no obligation on part
of Dabur International to pay royalty. As discussed supra, since income
arising from international transaction has to be determined having regards to
arm's length price, existence of agreement or otherwise is not relevant.
Therefore, argument of the appellant that agreement was not in operation
during period under consideration is not relevant as price of international
transaction is to be determined by TP regulations. The undisputed fact is that
Dabur International Ltd, has been permitted to use Dabur brand name and the
appellant had been receiving royalty income for the same upto AY 2005-06. The
TPO has adopted said agreement dated 01.04.2003 as basis for arm's length
price in the absence of any comparable provided by the appellant. Now the
issue is whether TPO is correct is adopting 3% rate of royalty chargeable  26
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 from Dabur International Limited.
Clause 4 of said agreement is reproduced as under:-
" In consideration for due discharge by Dabur of its obligations hereunder and
use of its trademark/trade name, Dabur is entitled during terms of agreement
to a royalty of:
(a) 3% of FOB sales ( net of taxes and sales return ) of Redrock of Dabur
branded products which are developed and marketed by Redrock through technical
and R& D support from Dabur and which are manufactured in accordance with
technical specifications detailed by Dabur
(b) 1% of FOB sales (net of taxes and sales return) of Redrock of Dabur
branded products which are developed by Redrock from any other party without
any technical and R & D support from Dabur."
12.7.2 The appellant has argued that since Dabur International Ltd. had not
sourced any technical support from Dabur India, clause (a) above shall not
apply. This contention of the appellant can not be brushed aside completely in
view of letters furnished by the appellant mentioned supra. The Ld TPO has
also mentioned this fact in para 15.7 and 15.8 of TPO's order. However, the Ld
TPO worked out the royalty @ 3% of FOB sales assuming that technology was also
provided. However, considering the evidence furnished by the appellant, it is
seen that products manufactured by Dabur International in UAE are different
from those manufactured in India and in case of same name of products, it has
been shown that oil base (raw material) is different from those products
manufactured in India. Therefore, it can be safely inferred that most of the
products if not all, manufactured in UAE are being manufacture without
technical support from Dabur India. In view of this, there shall be a portion
of FOB sale on which royalty become payable @3 % and another substantial
portion of FOB sales on which royalty' shall become payable @ 1%. In view of
these facts, it shall be more realistic and reasonable if royalty payable is
worked out @ 2% on total FOB sales ie. Average rate. Accordingly, I hold that
arm's length price of royalty from Dabur International is Rs.22.58 lakhs. The
AO is directed to give relief to the appellant on this account accordingly.
12.8 Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal 12.8.1 The appellant has entered into an
agreement dated 05.11.1992 with Dabur Nepal Pvt Ltd., clause 3 of which is
reproduced as below: "That as Dabur is allowing DNPL to use its trademarks for
sale of products in Nepal, India and other third countries and also entire
marketing expenses including salaries and allowances of sales personnel would
be borne by Dabur, DNPL will pay to Dabur inform of royalty @7.5% of net
sales. " 27
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Based on this, the TPO has computed
royalty chargeable from Dabur Nepal @ 7.5% of sales while the appellant has
declared royally income of Rs. NIL. The appellant has contended that w.e.f.
01.04.2005, this agreement has ceased to be operative and has furnished
letters dated May, 2005 and 05.02.2013 in support. The appellant has contended
that TPO has wrongly applied rate of 7.5% as mentioned in agreement dated
05.11.1992 while that agreement was amended and rate of royalty was changed to
3% w.e.f. 01.04.2004. The appellant has furnished copy of amended agreement in
which only rate of royalty has been changed to 3% while rest of the terms
remained the same. 12.8.2 As discussed supra, since income arising from
international transaction has to be determined having regards to arm's length
price, existence of agreement or otherwise is not relevant. Therefore,
argument of the appellant that agreement was not in operation during period
under consideration is not relevant as price of international transaction is
to be determined by TP regulations. The undisputed fact is that Dabur Nepal
has been permitted to use Dabur brand name and the appellant had been
receiving royalty income for the same upto AY 2005-06. The TPO has treated
said agreement dated 05.11.1992 as basis for arm's length price in the absence
of any comparable provided by the appellant. Now the issue is whether TPO is
correct in adopting 7.5% rate of royalty chargeable from Dabur Nepal. The
approach of TPO in relying upon agreement dated 05.11.1992 and not considering
amended agreement dated 01.04.2004 is fallacious as contemporaneous
material/document should have been considered instead of document which is
remote in time. Accordingly, TPO is not correct in applying rate of 7.5% and
ignoring rate of 3% as mentioned in amended agreement.
12.8.3 Further, appellant has argued that as per clause 3 of the agreement,
Dabur India was under obligation to bear entire marketing expenses including
salaries and allowances of sales personnel. However, Dabur India could not
meet with its obligations and hence Dabur Nepal did not pay any royalty. This
contention of the appellant carries some weight as rate of royalty might have
been fixed after considering reimbursement of marketing expenses by Dabur
India. The TPO has not established that this contention of the appellant is
factually incorrect 12.8.4 Considering the contentions of the appellant that
it had not met with obligations cast upon it under clause 3 of the agreement,
it would not prudent to apply rate of 3% as mentioned in amended agreement to
work out royalty chargeable. It is also seen that international transaction of
allowing use of trade name/trade mark to its AEs by the appellant is the same
with respect to Dabur International and Dabur Nepal. Therefore, there is no
reason to assign higher price in respect of international transaction with
Dabur Nepal than that with Dabur International. As discussed supra, I have
held that royalty at rate of 2% of FOB sales would be arm's length price in
respect of Dabur  28 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 International.
Accordingly, I hold that royalty at rate of 2% of FOB sales would be arm's
length price in respect of Dabur Nepal also and this would take care of
non¬discharge of obligations on part of the appellant. In this manner, royalty
chargeable from Dabur Nepal comes out to be Rs.42.96 lakhs. The AO is
therefore, directed to give relief on this account accordingly. 12.9 Asian
Consumer Care Pvt Ltd, Bangladesh 12.9.1 The Appellant contends that in case
of Dabur Bangladesh, the agreement was valid for 2 years and expired in 2005.
From 01-04-20005, the appellant did not renew the agreement but an amendment
was made with a condition that royalty will be revised to 2% for composite
usage of Trademark and technical know-how provided by the Appellant to
Bangladesh. Further Bangladesh will pay 1% technical know-how royalty to the
Appellant and no trade mark royalty will be payable if Bangladesh was to incur
8% of AMP spent on sales. However, it seems from the contention of the
Appellant that even this was not acted upon from 01-04-2005. However,
composite royalty rates were brought down to 2% from 6% w.e.f. 01-04-2005. The
Appellant contends that even if royalty rate is to be used, the rate should be
zero has Bangladesh was spending significant AMP exceeding 8% of sales and
finding difficult to survive in the completive environment. As per the TPO,
the Appellant has not shown any evidence that the agreement is not in force or
any amendment thereafter. In fact till last year, royalty was being received
from the AE. This year also there were transactions with the AE. It has not
been the claim of the assessee that the AE has stopped the use of trade marks
which are owned by the assessee.
12.9.2 Based on this, the TPO has computed royalty chargeable from Dabur
Bangladesh @ 6% of sales while the appellant has declared royalty income of
Rs. NIL. Before me the the appellant has contended that w.e.f. 01.04.2005, the
agreement was not renewed and that the amended agreement of 01-04-2005 was not
acted upon as the original agreement was not renewed. 12.9.3 As discussed
supra, since income arising from international transaction has to be
determined having regards to arm's length price, existence of agreement or
otherwise is not relevant. Therefore, argument of the appellant that agreement
was not in operation during period under consideration is not relevant as
price of international transaction is to be determined by TP regulations. The
undisputed fact is that Dabur Bangladesh has been permitted to use Dabur brand
name and the appellant had been receiving royalty income for the same upto AY
2006-07. The TPO has treated said agreement dated December 2003 as basis for
arm's length price in the absence of any comparable provided by the appellant
Now the issue is whether TPO is correct in adopting 6% rate of royalty
chargeable from Dabur Bangladesh. The approach of TPO in relying upon
agreement dated December 2003 and not considering amended agreement dated
01.04.2005 is fallacious as  29 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
contemporaneous material/document should have been considered instead of
document which is remote in time. Accordingly, TPO is not correct in applying
rate of 6% and ignoring rate of 2% as mentioned in amended agreement.
12.9.4 Further, appellant has argued that as per amended agreement, there
should not be any charge of trademark royalty as Dabur Bangladesh has incurred
more than 8% of AMP on sales as a pre requisite. Besides this the Appellant
contends that no technology has been provided by them to Bangladesh. However,
no cogent evidence has been produced by the Appellant that no technology was
provided by them after 01-04-2005. The contentions of the Appellant that
agreement was not in force after 01-04-2005 and hence no technology could have
been provided has not been clearly established. However, a fact remains that
Dabur logo was continued to be used by Dabur Bangladesh even after termination
of agreement post 2005. 12.9.5 In view even if Dabur Bangladesh was incurring
AMP in excess of 8% of sales, a bright line test need to be demonstrated to
show the benefit availed by the appellant. Hence the contention that no
royalty should be charged in not tenable. With regards to technology, no
concrete evidence has been furnished to show the claim that no technology is
received by Bangladesh. It is also seen that international transaction of
allowing use of trade name/trade mark to its AEs by the appellant is the same
with respect to Dabur International and Dabur Nepal. Therefore, there is no
reason to assign higher price in respect of international transaction with
Dabur Nepal than that with Dabur International. As discussed supra, I have
held that royalty at rate of 2% of FOB sales would be arm's length price in
respect of Dabur International and Dabur Nepal. Accordingly, I hold that
royalty at rate of 2% of FOB sales would be arm's length price in respect of
Dabur Bangladesh. In this manner, royalty chargeable from Dabur Bangladesh
comes out to be Rs.23.90 iakhs. The AO is therefore, directed to give relief
on this account accordingly."
32\. Aggrieved with such part relief granted by the CIT(A), the assessee as
well as the Revenue are in appeal before the Tribunal.
33\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee strongly challenged the order of the
CIT(A) in restricting the royalty charged to 2% in respect of all the three
AEs. He submitted that notional income cannot be imputed under section 92 of
the Income- tax Act, 1961. He submitted that no royalty was actually received
by the assessee  30 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 from its
associated enterprises in the relevant assessment year and the transfer
pricing adjustment has been made merely on notional basis.
34\. He submitted that for application of section 92 of the Act, there has to
be, first, income embedded in the international transaction. Accordingly,
where an international transaction is entered without consideration, section
92 of the Act, not being in the nature of charging provision, cannot be
applied to impute notional income. He submitted that transfer pricing
provisions cannot compel an assessee to mandatorily and necessarily charge
consideration for an international transaction with another associated
enterprise. He accordingly submitted that the entire adjustment of Rs.2.67
crores made by the TPO ought to be directed to be deleted.
35\. So far as agreement with Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal, is concerned, he
submitted that the associated enterprises, viz, Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal
was incorporated in the year 1992 wherein 97.5% of shareholding was held by
the assessee directly/indirectly. During the year 1992, the assessee, for the
purpose of manufacturing consumer products, entered into a marketing agreement
dated 05.11.1992 with Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd under the apprehension of expected
technical, marketing, financial and managerial support for the manufacture of
hair oil, Lal Dant Manjan, Dant Mukta, tooth power/tooth paste and herbal
candies, etc. As per this agreement, the parties agreed to the following:
a) That Dabur Nepal will be entitled to use the trade mark of 'Dabur' for sale
of products in Nepal and abroad during the duration of the agreement;  31
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
b) That the assessee will assist in recruitment of specialized personnel to
train and impart information on technical know-how and marketing of produce to
personnel at its production works in India and for which Dabur shall not
charge any fee;
c) That the entire marketing expenses including salaries and allowances of
sales personnel would be borne by the assessee. In consideration of such
expenses being borne by the assessee, Dabur Nepal agreed to pay royalty @ 7.5%
of its net sale.
36\. Referring to clause 7 of the agreement, he submitted that that the
aforesaid agreement was to become effective only after the approval by the
Government of Nepal and was to remain valid for a period of 10 years from that
date unless renewed by mutual consent in writing and with prior approval of
Government of Nepal.
37\. He submitted that in 2004, the aforesaid marketing agreement was amended
with effect from 01.04.2004, wherein the royalty payable by Dabur Nepal was
reduced to 3% on local sales of branded products only. He submitted that due
to high operational cost and expenditure on various administrative costs,
Dabur Nepal vide letter dated May, 2005, informed the assessee-company that no
royalty would be payable to the assessee. The said letter was accepted by the
assessee as it had failed to bear the marketing expenses of Dabur Nepal in
accordance with the agreement. Referring to the letter dated 05.02.2013
addressed by the assessee to Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., he submitted it was
confirmed that the marketing agreement has ceased to operate w.e.f. 01.04.2005
and that the assessee permitted Dabur  32 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 Nepal to use logo of 'Dabur' upon condition that the company
will promote 'Dabur' trademark on its own cost and as per the standard norms
of the assessee relating to quality of product and other specified conditions.
He accordingly submitted that during the assessment year 2007-08, the
marketing agreements on the basis of which royalty was payable, was not in
existence and thus, the assessee had not incurred any expenditure on account
of the same in year under consideration.
38\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee further submitted that no royalty was
chargeable from Dabur Nepal for the following reasons:
a) The assessee was having 97.5% ownership in Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.,
directly/indirectly and thus, it could not have received any royalty from
itself.
b) The agreement dated 05.11.1992 had expired and the Nepal Government had not
renewed the said agreement later on. Thus, in the absence of any legally
enforceable agreement, no royalty was payable by M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd to
the assessee;
c) Even otherwise, since, the assessee had failed to discharge its obligation
to bear the marketing costs which included the advertisement and remuneration
to sales personnel, the assessee does not have any right to charge any royalty
from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
d) On application of FAR analysis and considering substantial marketing
expenses incurred by Dabur Nepal, there was no ground for recovery of royalty.
33
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
e) The assessee along with Dabur Foods Ltd, India was purchasing 72% of the
products manufactured by M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., the details of which are
tabulated as under:
    Particulars                                      Amount (in Nepal Rs.
                                                     Lakhs)
    Sales to Dabur India Ltd.                        11,004.83
Sales to Dabur Foods Ltd., India (Related party) 14,224.82 Total sales to
group companies in India 25,229.65 Total sales of Dabur Nepal 35,181.11 % of
sales to Indian group companies 72%
39\. He accordingly submitted that in view of the above, no royalty could have
been charged by the assessee in respect of those goods which were sold to the
assessee and its group company.
40\. Without prejudice to the above, the ld. Counsel for the assessee
submitted that even if it is assumed that the royalty was to be charged by the
assessee, then same amount would be added in the purchases of Dabur Nepal and
thus the impact will be revenue neutral i.e. on the one hand, income will be
increased by crediting the royalty and on the other hand, the cost of
purchases will be increased by the same amount, since the sale was made by M/s
Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. to the assessee/group company. He accordingly submitted
that no royalty was chargeable from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
41\. Referring to the order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for the
immediately preceding assessment year, vide ITA No.3257/Del/2013, order dated
12th April, 2017, the ld. Counsel submitted that the issue stands covered in
favour  34 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 of the assessee wherein
the Tribunal held that no royalty was payable to the assessee by M/s Dabur
Nepal (P) Ltd. and deleted the addition made by the TPO/CIT(A) the relevant
part of which is as per para 36 of the order. He accordingly submitted that in
view of the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case, the action of the
CIT(A) holding that the royalty @2% has to be charged from Dabur Nepal (P)
Ltd., is not sustainable and addition sustained by CIT(A) is liable to be
deleted.
42\. So far as the agreement with Dabur International Ltd., UAE operations is
concerned, the ld. Counsel submitted that the assessee entered into an
Agreement dated 1.04.2003 with M/s. Redrock Ltd., Isle of Man, UK, which was
engaged in the business of production and manufacture of FMCG products, to
provide technical, marketing and managerial support for manufacture of
products, inter alia, in UAE. Subsequently, the assessee, in the year 2003
itself, acquired M/s. Redrock Ltd and the said company became 100% subsidiary
of the assessee. Later on, the name of Redrock Ltd was changed to ' Dabur
International Ltd.' As per this agreement, the parties agreed to the following
with respect to UAE operations:-
a) That the assessee will provide technical and R&D support, know-how,
operational improvements, etc., in the areas of cost management,
manufacturing, production, procurement, sale, marketing and distribution, etc.
35 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
b) Dabur International will be entitled to use the trade mark of 'Dabur' in
relation to products which are manufactured through technical and R&D support
from the assessee.
c) In consideration, the assessee would be entitled to royalty as follows: a.
3% of FOB Sales of Dabur branded products which are developed and marketed by
Dabur International through technical and R&D support from the assessee and
which are manufactured in accordance with technical specifications detailed by
the assessee;
b. 1% of FOB Sales of Dabur branded products which are developed by Dabur
International from any other party without any technical and R&D support from
the assessee.
43\. Referring to clause 5 of the agreement, he submitted that the aforesaid
agreement was for a period of 24 months (i.e., expiring on 31.03.2005). He
submitted that due to heavy advertisement expenditure incurred by Dabur Dubai
and refusal of the assessee to reimburse the brand building expenses, Dabur
International vide letter dated 07.04.2005, informed the assessee-company that
no royalty would be payable to the assessee with effect from financial year
2005-06. The said letter was accepted by the assessee vide communication dated
01.02.2013 addressed to Dabur International wherein it was confirmed that the
agreement has ceased to operate w.e.f. 01.04.2005 and also the assessee
permitted Dabur International to use logo of'Dabur' upon condition that the
company will promote  36 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 'Dabur'
trademark on its own cost and as per the standard norms of the assessee
relating to quality of product and other specified conditions.
44\. He accordingly submitted that during the assessment year 2007-08, the
agreement on the basis of which royalty was payable, was not in existence and
thus, no royalty was due to be received to the assessee in year under
consideration.
45\. He further submitted that no royalty could be chargeable from Dabur Dubai
during the year under consideration due to the following reasons:
a) The assessee was having 100% ownership in Dabur International,
directly/indirectly and thus, it could not have received any royalty from
itself.
b) The agreement was not renewed by Dabur International in the year 2005 and
the same was defunct in the financial year 2006-07. Thus, in the absence of
any contractual agreement, the assessee was not eligible to receive any
royalty from Dabur Dubai.
c) Products manufactured by Dabur Dubai were totally different from the
products manufactured in India by the assessee and so much so even in the case
of some of the products having identical name, the raw material and medium
used in the manufacture were totally different from the raw material and
medium used in India. Thus, merely on the basis of trade name of 'Dabur', the
products manufactured by Dabur International were not accepted in UAE and that
it had to manufacture the products as per the local needs and taste of the
public residing in the public area of UAE.
37
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
d) In order to penetrate UAE market, Dabur International adopted its own
market strategy and had made all the efforts for the establishment of "Dabur"
name in the UAE which was very little known in that geographical area and
incurred lot of expenses on advertisement and market establishment and had
borne all the risks of market, manufacture and finance which is evident from
letters dated 18.07.2011 and 20.07.2011 issued by Dabur International.
e) The assessee had neither made any efforts in establishing the trade name in
UAE nor had made any contribution to Dabur International. Thus, Dabur
International had not renewed the royalty agreement because the assessee was
not willing to undertake any risk/obligation/responsibility.
f) On application of FAR analysis and considering substantial marketing
expenses incurred by Dabur International, there was no ground for recovery of
royalty which has been appreciated by the ld. CIT(A) at page 33 and 33 of his
order.
46\. He submitted that at the time of entering into the agreement, Dabur
International was considering to manufacture products with the technical and
R&D support of the assessee in respect of the Ayurvedic/herbal products.
However, subsequently, it realized that the ayurvedic products were not
acceptable in UAE because there were no Ayurvedic doctors available and only
the Unani system of medicines was acceptable as per the local trend and
custom. As a result, Dabur International abandoned its idea to manufacture
Ayurvedic/herbal products and entered into the business of FMCG products which
were manufactured by them  38 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 with
their own technology as per the requirement and considering the taste of local
public. Thus, no technical know-how of the assessee was utilized by Dabur
International.
47\. He further submitted that brand value in a particular area does not
depend upon ownership but it depends upon various factors like quality and
acceptable products in local public and in the present case, Dabur
International, by incurring expenditure and making efforts had become the
economic owner of the mark in commercial sense for that area.
48\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that Dabur International is
wholly owned by the assessee, and therefore, it was necessary for Dabur
International to use and depict the name "Dabur" which basically denotes the
ownership mark on the products manufactured and continuation of the use of
name "Dabur" on the products was in the nature of shareholder's activity, not
only to secure the investment made by the assessee but also to enhance the
value of "Dabur" brand.
49\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee drew the attention of the Bench to the
FAR Analysis of royalty as under:
    S.No FAR Points                                Dabur India        Dabur Dubai

50\. He submitted that prior to the agreement entered by the assessee with
Dabur Dubai, the presence of Dabur in UAE was negligible. The 'Dabur' brand
was almost non-existent in UAE. It was only due to the significant advertising
and marketing undertaken by Dabur International, the brand 'Dabur' was built
in UAE. He submitted that the assessee was not required to contribute any
amount towards such brand building exercise in UAE. At the cost of this
arrangement, the assessee agreed to forego its royalty right for usage of
Dabur brand by Dabur International. The functionality/ activity of AMP spend
by Dabur Dubai is nothing but performance of AMP/ Marketing service at the
cost of royalty waiver. He submitted that the aforesaid arrangement is in
accordance with the TP provisions and regulations.
51\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee referred to provisions of Rule 10B
(2)(b) which states that the functions performed, taking into account assets
employed or to be employed and the risks assumed by the parties to the
transaction will form a vital basis for judging the arm's length price. Sub
clause (c) states that the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are
formal or in writing) of the transactions which lay down explicitly or
implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided
between the respective parties to the transaction.
52\. He submitted that if the assessee was to charge for trade mark royalty
from Dabur International, then, the Indian Company would have to pay the AMP
expenses of Dabur International, which are in fact, significantly more than
the  40 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 royalty that would have been
received by the assessee. For the above proposition he drew the attention of
the Bench to the analysis of AMP spent by Dabur Dubai which is as under:-
    S. No. Financial             AMP    % of AMP to
           year        Sales (in (in    Sales
                       lakhs) lakhs)
    1.    2004-05      5427      631    11.62%
    2.    2005-06      7643      1416   18%
    3.    2006-07      11425 2298       20%
    4.    2007-08      14926 2241       15%
    5.    2008-09      21728 2918       13.5%
    6.    2009-10      27474 5740       21%
    7.    2010-11      34540 10524      30%
    8.    2011-12      49823 14284      29%
53\. Referring to the above, he submitted that significant amount of AMP
expenses of Rs.22.98 crs. were incurred by Dabur International on brand
building, which far more exceeded the royalty which the assessee would have
otherwise received [royalty of Rs. 1.15 cr @1% on sales of Rs.l 14.25 cr.] in
case it had agreed to reimburse/borne the aforesaid AMP expenses.
54\. Referring to the order of CIT(A), he submitted that the ld. CIT(A) has
incorrectly stated that the assessee was unable to establish that the
associated enterprise incurred abnormal AMP expenses which exceeded the
'Bright Line Test' as no AMP spend figures were provided, without appreciating
that the said figures were duly filed by the assessee and also re-produced in
the appellate order @ page 33, which clearly established that the associated
enterprise had incurred substantial AMP expenditure, which exceeded the bright
line test. Further, the TPO/AO had not applied any Transfer Pricing method as
prescribed under the Act,  41 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 but
simply made the adjustment in respect of royalty based on the earlier
agreement which had already expired. He submitted that no notional royalty
ought to be imputed in the income of the assessee merely on the basis of the
defunct royalty agreement dated 01.04.2003 and in the absence of any evidence
of provision of any services technical or otherwise, by the assessee to its
associated enterprise. He accordingly submitted that addition on account
royalty sustained by CIT(A) is liable to be deleted in toto.
55\. Referring to the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y.
2006-07, he submitted that the Tribunal, under identical circumstances, has
held that rate of 0.75% is to be adopted to compute the amount of royalty from
Dabur Dubai. In arriving at the said conclusion, the Tribunal has appreciated
the following facts/ findings:
"a) During the year under consideration, there was no agreement to make any
payment of royalty between the assessee and Dabur Dubai;
b) The product manufactured by Dabur Dubai were totally different from the
products manufactured in India and even the raw material used in those
products manufactured in UAE was different from the raw material used in
India;
c) The assessee had not made any effort for establishing the trade name nor
had made any other contribution. Therefore, the assessee did not receive any
royalty for the year under consideration;
42
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
d) Dabur Dubai had not manufactured any products with the technical know-how
and R&D support of the assessee but had manufactured on its own, in accordance
with the requirement and local taste of the local public;
e) Income arising from an international transaction shall be computed having
regard to the arm's length price which shall be determined as per provisions
of Section 92 and section 92C of the Act;
f) As per the provisions of section 92C of the Act read with Rules 10B and 10C
of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, for the purpose of making transfer pricing
adjustments, the ami's length price has to be determined on finding out
similar type of payments received by similarly situated and comparable
independent entities;
g) The lower authorities have not applied any transfer pricing method as
prescribed under the Act and simply made the adjustment in respect of royalty
based on the earlier agreements which had already expired and there was no new
agreement between the assessee and its AEs."
56\. He submitted that the rate of 0.75% adopted by the Tribunal in its order
for assessment year 2006-07 is ad-hoc, arbitrary and excessive. He submitted
that in the order, the Tribunal though correctly appreciated the facts of the
present case that: (a) there was no enforceable royalty agreement during the
year under consideration; (b) products manufactured by Dabur International
were different from the products manufactured in India; (c) heavy marketing
expenses were borne  43 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 by Dabur
International; and (d) no expenses incurred by Dabur International for brand
building were reimbursed/borne by the assessee, but proceeded to impute ad-
hoc royalty rate of 0.75%, without giving any basis or calculation for
applying such rate. Further, the Tribunal failed to appreciate that "Dabur"
was not used as a brand name for the products, but it merely represented
ownership title and nothing more.
57\. He submitted that the Tribunal, at para 33 and 34 of the order, has given
a finding that arm's length price in respect of an international transaction
is to be calculated by adopting any of the five methods prescribed in section
92 of the Act and also discussed the provisions of section 92C of the Act
along with Rules 10B and 10C which prescribe the methods to determine the
arm's length price based on similar type of payments received by similarly
situated and comparable independent entities. Further, the Tribunal also gave
a finding that the lower authorities have failed to apply any transfer pricing
method as prescribed under the Act. However, while concluding, the Tribunal
still proceeded to impute an ad-hoc rate of 0.75%, without definitively
pointing out prescribed transfer pricing method used to compute such arm's
length price.
58\. Referring to provisions of section 92C of the Act and CBDT Instruction
No.3 of 2003 dated 20.05.2003, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that
the scheme of transfer pricing regulation provides for benchmarking of an  44
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 international transaction by applying
one of the prescribed methods and on the basis of Rules provided for each of
the methods.
59\. Referring to the following decisions, he submitted that in A.Y. 2006-07
or 2007-08, the prescribed method to calculate the ALP of the Royalty has not
been applied:-
> (i) Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India Pvt. Ltd. vs. CIT: 374 ITR 118
> (Del).
> (ii) CIT vs. EKL Appliances Ltd: 345 ITR 241 (Del).
> (iii) CA Computer Associates Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA Nos. 5420 and
> 542I/Mum/2006).
> (iv) CIT vs CA Computer Associates India Pvt Ltd (ITA No 20/2011).
> (v) CIT vs Cushman and Wakefield (India) Pvt Ltd. (ITA 475/ 2012)
> (vi) LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd., vs. ACIT (ITA No.5140/Del/2011)
> (vii) Nimbus Communications Ltd vs ACIT (ITA No 2361/Mum/2007
> (viii) Dresser Rand India Pvt Ltd vs Addl. CIT (ITA No 8753/Mum/2010)
> (ix) Thyssen Krupp Industries India Pvt Ltd vs ACIT (ITA No 7032/Mum/2011)
> (x) Hero Motocorp Ltd vs Addl CIT (ITA No 5130/Del/2010)
> (xi) Kodak India Pvt Ltd vs ACIT (ITA No 7349/Mum/2012)
> (xii) AWB India Pvt Ltd vs Addl CIT (ITA No 4454/Del/2012)
> (xiii) Kirby Building Systems India Ltd vs. Addl CIT (ITA 1975/ HYD/ 2010)
> (xiv) McCann Erickson India Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.5871/Del./2011)  45 ITA
> Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
> (xv) Ericsson India Private Ltd. (ITA No.5141/Del./2011) (xvi) SC Enviro
> Agro India Ltd vs DCIT (ITA No 704/Mum/2010)
60\. Referring to the order of the Tribunal, he submitted that if the Tribunal
would have applied any of the 5 prescribed method, in such scenario, the rate
of royalty would have been 'Nil'. He accordingly submitted that the rate of
royalty of 0.75% adopted by the Tribunal in assessment year 2006-07, cannot be
applied in assessment year 2007-08 without application of any of the methods
prescribed under section 92C of the Act and the adjustment on account of
royalty, made by the TPO/CIT(A), is unlawful, not sustainable and is liable to
be deleted.
61\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, however, pointed out that the
assessee's appeal against the order of the Tribunal has been dismissed by the
Delhi High Court and reported as [2018) 253 Taxman 129, as not laying down any
substantial question of law.
62\. Referring to the order of the Hon'ble High Court, he submitted that the
Hon'ble Court dismissed the appeal as not laying down any substantial question
of law. Further, while dismissing the appeal, the Court observed that the
assessee's submissions that omission to show an initial income cannot be
scrutinized at all cannot be accepted. The Court further observed that the
assessee is required to explain why the Dabur brand has been permitted to an
overseas entity without any charge.
46
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
63\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the aforesaid
observations are only in the context of adjudicating whether or not the
assessee's appeal give rise to any substantial question of law or not, in
order the High Court to assume jurisdiction to entertain the appeal or not.
64\. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari: [2001] 251 ITR 84 (SC), the ld. Counsel
for the assessee drew the attention of the Bench to the following
observations:-
> "The High Court cannot proceed to hear a second appeal without formulating
> the substantial question of law involved in the appeal and if it does so it
> acts illegally and in abnegation or abdication of the duty cast on Court.
> The existence of substantial question of law is the sine qua non for the
> exercise of the jurisdiction under the amended Section 100 of the Code. [See
> Kshitish Chandra Purkait Vs. Santosh Kumar Purkait & Ors., (1997) 5 SCC 438,
> Panchugopal Barua Vs. Umesh Chandra Goswami, (1997) 4 SCC 713 and Kondila
> Dagadu Kadam Vs. Savitribai Sopan Gujar & Ors., (1999) 3 SCC 722]. "
65\. He submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court, thus, categorically held
that "existence of substantial question of law is the sine qua non for the
exercise of the jurisdiction under the amended Section 100 of the Code",
meaning thereby that unless substantial question of law arises and the same is
formulated, the High Court does not have the power to exercise jurisdiction.
66\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee further submitted that while dismissing
the appeal, the Hon'ble High Court observed that the assessee's submissions
that the transaction cannot be scrutinized cannot be accepted and further
observed that the assessee is required to explain why the "Dabur" brand has
been permitted to an  47 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 overseas
entity without any charge. He submitted that "Dabur" was mentioned by the
subsidiary only as a recognition of ownership of the company and not as a
brand outside India. Secondly, huge advertisement expenditure was incurred by
the subsidiary outside India and therefore, there was no warrant to justify
charging of any further fee.
67\. Lastly, the ld. Counsel submitted that it is settled law that any
adjustment can only be made by application of one of the prescribed methods
and the Tribunal clearly held that none of the recognized methods were applied
by the authorities. Being so, the Tribunal, in assessment year 2006-07, ought
to have deleted the entire addition rather than partly confirming the same.
Further, Dabur International had spent significant AMP expenses and
accordingly, the brand 'Dabur' was built in UAE by the efforts of Dabur
International alone and hence, there was no question of receiving any royalty
from Dabur International on this account. He accordingly submitted that since
Dabur International has incurred substantial expenses on advertisement, market
establishment and had borne all the risks of market, manufacture and finance,
therefore, it is in a way entitled to the economic benefits related to the
brand 'Dabur' in UAE. In view of the aforesaid, it may be inferred that though
the legal ownership of the 'Dabur' brand vests with the assessee-company, but
by incurring significant AMP expenses and building the brand of'Dabur' in UAE
which was almost non-existent earlier, Dabur  48 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 International has gained/acquired economic ownership of the
brand 'Dabur' in UAE.
68\. Referring to the decision of Hon'ble Delhi Court, in the case of Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications India Pvt. Ltd vs CIT: 374 ITR 118 he submitted
it has been held that the concept of economic ownership is well recognized in
international taxation. It has been held in the above decision that if the
Indian entity is the economic owner of the brand and is incurring AMP expenses
for the purpose of promotion of such brand, benefit is only received by the
Indian entity. Applying the same rationale to the facts of the present case,
Dabur International, UAE is the economic owner of the brand in UAE and has
incurred significant AMP expenses for the purpose of promotion of such brand.
He submitted that the economic ownership of the brand rests with the Dabur
International and accordingly, it cannot be expected to make any payment to
the assessee towards royalty as the asset is economically owned by it. He
accordingly submitted that the addition made on account of royalty from Dabur
International should be directed to be deleted in toto.
69\. So far as royalty from Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh is
concerned, the ld. Counsel submitted that the assessee entered into an
agreement dated 01.12.2003 with Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh
(ACCPL), which was engaged in the business of manufacturing and packaging of
consumer  49 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 and healthcare products
in Bangladesh. The salient features of the agreement are as follows:
• The agreement was entered into to provide trademark of 'Dabur' for use to
ACCPL.
• The agreement was for a period of 2 years [Refer clause 3 of the agreement],
• ACCPL have to pay royalty to the assessee at the rate of 6% of FOB sales
(net of taxes and sales return) which were developed and marketed by ACCPL
using technical know-how and R&D support of the assessee. Referring to page 39
of the paper book, he submitted that the aforesaid agreement was amended with
effect from 01.04.2005 wherein it was provided that no trademark royalty will
be payable to the assessee where ACCPL incurs cost of advertisement, marketing
and promotion (AMP Expenses) in excess of 8 percent on sales every year. He
submitted that till December, 2005, ACCPL was using the technical knowhow of
the assesse to manufacture its products. However, the said products so
manufactured did not meet the expectations of Bangladesh market. Accordingly,
after 2006, ACCPL started using technical know-how of Dabur International,
which was able to cater to the needs of people of Dubai. Accordingly, during
the assessment year 2007-08, there was no agreement in existence with ACCPL
and the said company was, in fact, using the technical know of Dabur
International. He accordingly submitted that no royalty was received by the
assesse during the year under consideration due to the following reasons:
50
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
a) The assessee was having 100% ownership in ACCPL, directly/indirectly and
thus, it could not have received any royalty from itself.
b) The agreement with ACCPL became defunct in December, 2005 and the same was
not renewed thereafter. Thus, in the absence of any contractual agreement, the
assessee was not eligible to receive any royalty from ACCPL.
c) Products manufactured by ACCPL using technical knowhow of the assessee did
not meet the requirements of customers in Bangladesh. Accordingly, after 2006,
ACCPL entered into an agreement with Dabur Dubai to provide technical know.
d) Merely on the basis of trade name of "Dabur" the products manufactured by
ACCPL were not accepted in Bangladesh and that it had to manufacture the
products as per the local needs and taste of the public residing in the public
area.
e) In order to penetrate Bangladesh market, ACCPL adopted its own market
strategy and had made all the efforts for the establishment of "Dabur" name in
Bangladesh which was very little known in that geographical area and incurred
lot of expenses on advertisement, market establishment and had borne all the
risks of market, manufacture and finance.
f) The assessee had neither made any efforts in establishing the trade name in
Bangladesh nor had made any contribution towards the same to ACCPL.
70\. He further submitted that brand value in a particular area does not
depend upon ownership but it depends upon various factors like quality and
acceptable products in local public and in the present case, ACCPL by
incurring expenditure  51 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 and making
efforts had become the economic owner of the mark in commercial sense for that
area. Further, the TPO/AO had not applied any Transfer Pricing method as
prescribed under the Act, but simply made the adjustment in respect of royalty
based on the earlier agreement which had already expired. He accordingly
submitted that no notional royalty ought to be imputed in the income of the
assessee merely on the basis of the defunct royalty agreement dated 01.12.2003
and in the absence of any evidence of provision of any services technical or
otherwise, by the assessee to its associated enterprise.
71\. He submitted that it is the settled law that for the purposes of
determining tax liability under the provisions of the Act, substance of the
transaction over its legal form needs to be looked at. He submitted that prior
to the agreement entered by the assessee with Dabur International, the
presence of Dabur in Bangladesh was negligible. The 'Dabur' brand was almost
non-existent there. It was only due to the significant advertising and
marketing undertaken by ACCPL that the brand of 'Dabur' was built in
Bangladesh. He submitted that the assessee was not required to contribute any
amount towards such brand building exercise. He submitted that even otherwise
also if it is assumed that the agreement was in existence, even in such
circumstance, no royalty was receivable by the assesse as the AMP expenses of
ACCPL were more than 8%.
72\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee drew the attention of the Bench to the
analysis of AMP spent by Bangladesh which is as under:
52
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 S. No. Financial Sales (in % of AMP
> to Sales year lakhs) AMP (in lakhs)
> 1\. 2004-05 998.81 118.63 11.88%
> 2\. 2005-06 1438.89 164.92 11.46%
> 3\. 2006-07 1335.93 195.13 14.60%
> 4\. 2007-08 988.32 182.63 18.42%
> 5\. 2008-09 1548.18 269.82 17.37%
73\. Referring to the above, he submitted that significant amount of AMP
expenses were incurred by ACCPL which during the assessment year 2007-08 was
14.60%. Thus, in accordance with the amended agreement, no royalty was even
otherwise payable by ACCPL to the assessee. Further, since the CIT(A)/TPO had
arbitrarily computed the rate of royalty without applying any of the
prescribed methods under section 92C of the Act, therefore, the adjustment on
account of royalty, made by the TPO/CIT(A), is unlawful, not sustainable and
is liable to be deleted.
74\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee further submitted that since ACCPL has
incurred substantial expenses on advertisement, market establishment and had
borne all the risks of market, manufacture and finance, therefore, it is in a
way entitled to the economic benefits related to the brand 'Dabur' in
Bangladesh. He drew the attention of the Bench to the analysis of Royalty
which is as under:-

           strategy
75\. Referring to the above, he submitted that though the legal ownership of
the 'Dabur' brand vests with the assessee-company, but by incurring
significant AMP expenses and building the brand of 'Dabur' in Bangladesh which
was almost non- existent earlier, ACCPL has gained/acquired economic ownership
of the brand 'Dabur' in Bangladesh.
76\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, referring to various observations of the
order of the TPO/AO while making such adjustment on account of Royalty,
heavily relied on their orders. He submitted that Dabur India Ltd. should
charge trade mark/trade name royalty for allowing them to use the trade
mark/trade names.
77\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO/TPO/CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered various decisions cited before us. We find,
the assessee is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and trading
of herbal products of health and personal care, cosmetics and veterinary
products and FMCG products, etc. The assessee in the past years had entered
into agreement with the following three AEs:-
> a) Dabur Nepal Ltd., Nepal;
> b) Dabur International Ltd., UAE; and  54 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
> 6256/Del/2014
> c) Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh.
78\. In terms of the agreement entered into with the aforesaid entities, the
assessee allowed its associated enterprises to provide assistance in
recruitment and imparting technical know-how, etc,, and permitted use of its
trademark 'Dabur' for sale of products. The aforesaid agreements were,
however, subsequently rescinded since the assessee did not provide any
marketing support nor imparted any technical knowhow and further considering
that substantial advertisement and marketing expenditures were incurred by the
AE's outside India. Accordingly, it was stated that no royalty was receivable/
received by the assessee from its associated enterprises during the impugned
assessment year 2007-08. However, the TPO rejected the arguments advanced by
the assessee and held that the associated enterprises have used the brand-
name/trade mark owned by the assessee without any compensation and
accordingly, computed arm's length price of royalty as follows:
    Company Name            FOB Sales   Rate of royalty
                            (Rs. in     adopted by      Royalty (Rs.
                            Lakhs)      TPO             in Lakhs)
    Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd,
    Nepal                    2,148      7.5%           161.10

    Total                                              266.67
79\. We find, in appeal, the ld. CIT(A) held that use of brand name by
associated enterprises is an international transaction, and, therefore, the
arm's length price  55 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 has to be
assessed under section 92 of the Act. However, the CIT(A) reduced such
calculation of royalty.
80\. So far as royalty from Dabur international Ltd., UAE is concerned, the
ld. CIT(A) observed that the products manufactured by Dabur International Ltd,
UAE are different from those manufactured in India and in some cases, even the
raw material is different. He held that most of the products manufactured in
UAE are manufactured without technical support from India. He accordingly,
reduced the rate of royalty to 2% as against 3% charged by the TPO and
accordingly restricted the arm's length price at Rs.22.58 lakhs.
81\. So far as Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal is concerned, the CIT(A) observed
that Rate of 3% is mentioned in the amended agreement and the assessee could
not meet its obligation to bear entire marketing expenses and therefore, Dabur
Nepal Pvt. Ltd, Nepal did not pay any royalty. Accordingly, the ld. CIT(A)
applied the same rate of royalty of 2% as in case of Dabur International Ltd,
UAE and restricted the arm's length price from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. at
Rs.42.96 lakhs. 81.1. So far as Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh is
concerned, the ld. CIT(A) observed that no evidence has been furnished by the
assessee to demonstrate that no technology was provided to Asian Consumer Care
Pvt. Ltd.; and the associated enterprises have continued to use the brand name
of 'Dabur.' Accordingly, he applied the same rate of royalty of 2% as applied
in case of Dabur  56 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
and Dabur International Ltd, UAE and restricted the arm's length price from
Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd. at Rs.23.90 lakhs. 81.2. It is the submission of
the ld. Counsel that the order of CIT(A) restricting the royalty charged at
the rate of 2% is not sustainable since notional income cannot be computed
under section 92 of the IT Act. It is his submission that so far as agreement
with Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal is concerned, the assessee is having 97.5%
of shareholding in Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal directly/indirectly and, thus,
it could not have received any royalty from itself. It is his submission that
the marketing agreement dated 05.11.1992 which was valid for a period of ten
years had expired and the Nepal Government had not renewed the said agreement
later on. Thus, in the absence of any legally enforceable agreement no royalty
was payable by Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., Nepal to the assessee. It is also his
submission that since the assessee had failed to discharge its obligation to
bear the marketing costs which included the advertisement and remuneration to
sales personnel, the assessee does not have any right to charge any royalty
from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. It is also his submission that the assessee along
with Dabur Foods Ltd, India was purchasing 72% of the products manufactured by
M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., and, therefore, no royalty could have been charged
by the assessee in respect of those goods which were sold to the assessee and
its group company. 81.3. So far as Dabur International Ltd., UAE is concerned,
it is the submission of the ld. Counsel that no royalty could be charged from
Dabur International Ltd.,  57 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 UAE
during the year, since the assessee is having 100% ownership in Dabur
International, directly/indirectly and thus, it could not have received any
royalty from itself. It is the submission of the ld. Counsel that the
agreement which was entered into by the assessee with M/s Redrock Ltd., Isle
of Man, UK on 01.04.2003 for a period of two years had expired on 31.03.2005.
The assessee in the year 2003 itself had acquired M/s Redrock Ltd. and the
said company became 100% subsidiary of the assessee and name was changed to
"Dabur International Ltd." and the agreement was not renewed by Dabur
International in the year 2005 and the same was defunct in the financial year
2006-07 and, therefore, in the absence of any contractual agreement, the
assessee was not eligible to receive any royalty from Dabur Dubai. Further,
the products manufactured by Dabur Dubai were totally different from the
products manufactured in India by the assessee. In order to penetrate UAE
market, Dabur International had made all the efforts for the establishment of
"Dabur" name in the UAE which was very little known in that geographical area
and it has incurred lot of expenses on advertisement, market establishment and
had borne all the risks of market, manufacture and finance. The assessee had
neither made any efforts in establishing the trade name in UAE nor had made
any contribution to Dabur International. Further, Dabur International had not
renewed the royalty agreement because the assessee was not willing to
undertake any risk/obligation/responsibility.
58
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 81.4. So far as Asian Consumer Care
Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh is concerned, it is his submission that the assessee was
having 100% ownership in ACCPL, directly/indirectly and thus, it could not
have received any royalty from itself. The agreement with ACCPL entered on
01.12.2003 which was for a period of two years became defunct in December,
2005 as the same was not renewed thereafter. Therefore, in the absence of any
contractual agreement, the assessee was not eligible to receive any royalty
from ACCPL. It is his submission that products manufactured by ACCPL using
technical knowhow of the assessee did not meet the requirements of customers
in Bangladesh. Accordingly, after 2006, ACCPL entered into an agreement with
Dabur Dubai to provide technical know. It is also his submission that merely
on the basis of trade name of 'Dabur', the products manufactured by ACCPL were
not accepted in Bangladesh and that it had to manufacture the products as per
the local needs and taste of the public residing in the public area. It is
also his submission that in order to penetrate the Bangladesh market, ACCPL
adopted its own market strategy and had made all the efforts for the
establishment of 'Dabur' name in the Bangladesh which was very little known in
that geographical area and incurred lot of expenses on advertisement, market
establishment and had borne all the risks of market, manufacture and finance.
Accordingly, the assessee had neither made any efforts in establishing the
trade name in Bangladesh nor had made any contribution towards the same. 81.5
It is the submission of the ld. Counsel for the assessee that although the
Tribunal in the assessment year 2006-07 has deleted the royalty from Dabur
Nepal,  59 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 however, had restricted
such royalty from Dabur Dubai to 0.75%. According to him, such royalty at
0.75% from Dabur, Dubai is incorrect since none of the prescribed method to
calculate the ALP of Royalty has been applied. Therefore, no addition on
account of royalty from Dabur Dubai and Asian Consumer Care, Bangladesh can be
made.
81.6 We find identical issue had come up before the Tribunal in assessee's own
case in the immediately preceding assessment year, i.e., 2006-07. We find, the
Tribunal vide ITA No.3257/Del/2003 and ITA No.3492/Del/2013, order dated
12.04.2017 has thoroughly discussed the issue and has deleted the royalty
receivable by the assessee from Dabur Nepal and had restricted the Royalty
receivable from Dabur International Ltd., UAE at 0.75% by observing as under:-
> "33\. We have considered the submissions of both the parties and carefully

how and R&D support in respect of the products which were mainly Aurvedic
medicines and Herbal products. But later on, the assessee entered into
business of FMCG products and acquired M/s Redrock Ltd., UAE and also changed
its name to M/s Dabur International Ltd., UAE. In the earlier year, M/s Dabur
International Ltd., UAE formerly known as M/s Redrock Ltd. had paid the
royalty @ 1% because no product had been manufactured with the help and
support of the assessee and the agreement was only upto 31st March 2005, the
payment of royalty was paid in accordance with the agreement which was in
existence with the said preceding year. However, for the year under
consideration, there was no such agreement and the product manufactured by M/s
Dabur International Ltd., UAE were totally different from the products
manufactured in India and even the raw material used in those products
manufactured in UAE was different from the raw material used in India. In the
present case, nothing is brought on record to substantiate that the products
manufactured in UAE were with the help of technical know-how and R&D support
of the assessee. On perusal of the provisions contained in Section 92 of the
Act it would be clear that the income arising from an international
transaction shall be computed having regard to the arm's length price which
shall be determined by any of the 5 methods prescribed in Sub-Section (1) of
Section 92 of the Act which are following:
"(a) Comparable and controlled price method;
(b) Resale price method;
(c) Cost plus method;
(d) Profit split method;
(e) Transactional net margin method; or such other method as may be prescribed
by the Board."
34\. It is also not in dispute that for determination of the arm's length
price, the provisions contained in Sub-Section (2) of Section 92C of the Act
shall be applied. The various methods has been prescribed under Rule 10B of
the Income Tax Rules, 1962 to determine the arm's length price u/s 92C of the
Act and Rule 10C of Income Tax Rules, 1962 further states that in selecting
61 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 the most appropriate method,
following factors shall be taken into consideration:
"(a) The specific characteristic of the property transferred or services
provided in either transactions.
(b) The function performed, taking into account the assets employed and the
risk assumption by the respective parties to the transactions.
(c) The contractual terms of the transactions which lay down explicitly or
implicitly how the responses, risk and benefits are to be divided between the
respective parties to the transactions.
(d) Conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to
the transactions operate, including the geographical location and size of the
market, the lodge and Government orders in force, costs of labour and capital
in the market, overall economic development and level of competition and
whether the markets are wholesale or retail."
35\. From the co-joint reading as contemplated u/s 92C of the Act read with
Rules 10B and 10C of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, it would be clear that for
the purpose of making transfer pricing adjustments, the arm's length price has
to be determined on finding out similar type of payments received by similarly
situated and comparable independent entities. But in the present case, no
comparable case has been brought on record by the TPO or the ld. CIT(A) while
making adjustment on account of royalty. Moreover, no agreement was in force
to charge royalty from the AEs and that the FMCG products are new to the
assessee who is known for its Herbal and Aurvedic products. In the instant
case, it is not brought on record that the assessee had incurred any expenses
for marketing the products manufactured by M/s Dabur International Ltd. (AE)
in UAE and that the assessee either made any efforts or contributed any money
for the establishment of its name in geographical area of UAE and the products
manufactured by the UAE were not different from the products manufactured in
India by the assessee. Moreover, the claim of the assessee that the raw
material and medium used in the manufacturing at UAE was totally different
from the raw material and medium used in India has not been rebutted. The
products manufactured by the assessee were as per the local needs and taste of
the public residing in UAE. Furthermore, the ld. CIT(A) himself admitted that
M/s Dabur International Ltd., UAE had not manufactured any products with the
technical know-how and R&D support of the assessee but had manufactured on its
own, in accordance with the requirement and local taste of the local public,
however, he directed the AO to calculate the royalty @ 2% but without any
basis. In the present case, it is an admitted fact that the TPO/AO had not
applied any transfer pricing method as prescribed under the Act and simply
made the adjustment in respect of royalty based on the earlier agreements
which had already expired and there was no new agreement between the assessee
and its AEs. The earlier agreement was entered by M/s Redrock Ltd. on 1st
April 2003, at that point of time, the said company was manufacturing the
products with the technical know-how and R&D support of the assessee in
respect of Aurvedic/Herbal products. But later  62 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 on, when the said company found that the Aurvedic products were
not acceptable in UAE as in the said country Unani system of medicines was
acceptable as per the local trend and custom. The said AE in UAE had abandoned
the manufacturing of the Ayurvedic/herbal products and then entered into the
business of FMCG products which were earlier manufactured by the Redrock Ltd.
with its own technology as per the requirement and taste of a local public of
UAE by keeping into consideration the geographical and market situation. The
said company was acquired by the assessee and now for the manufacturing of its
products, the assessee did not provide any market strategies, nothing is
brought on record that the assessee had borne the expenses, provided the funds
or compensated for market failure and the quality etc. It, therefore, appears
that the assessee had not made any effort for establishing the trade name nor
had made any other contribution. Therefore, the assessee did not receive any
royalty for the year under consideration and in the preceding year, the
royalty @ 1% was paid to the assessee for the reason that Ayurvedic products
were made with the technical know-how and R&D support of the assessee.
However, for the year under consideration, the FMCG products were manufactured
which were different from the Indian products having different raw material
and medium used in the manufacture. At the same time, the brand name of the
assessee was used by the AE and in the earlier years the assessee provided the
R&D support, know-how technologies etc. which helped the AE for the year under
consideration also to some extent. It is also noticed that the assessee
received the royalty @ 1% in the preceding year. The TPO also while working
out the royalty rate for the year under consideration was of the view that the
royalty @ 1% was chargeable on the products manufactured without the aid and
support of assessee company but marketed by using "Dabur" name, however, no
basis has been given for the same. In our opinion the estimate made by the TPO
for the rate of royalty was highly excessive. We, therefore, after considering
the totality of the facts are of the view that the ld. CIT(A) was not
justified in directing the AO to charge the royalty from Dabur International
UAE @ 2%. Particularly when, the assessee was not using the technical know-how
or R&D support from the assessee, in our opinion it will be fair and
reasonable to charge the royalty @ 0.75% by considering this fact that in the
year under consideration the assessee had incurred huge expenses on marketing,
advertisement & brand building etc. and that in the preceding year the royalty
was although charged @ 1% on the products manufactured without R&D support and
technical know-how from the assessee but the aforesaid expenses were
comparability less.
36\. As regards to the royalty charged from M/s Dabur Nepal Ltd. is concerned,
it is not in dispute that earlier the royalty received was @ 7.5% as the
assessee was bearing the cost of marketing expenses but later on M/s Dabur
Nepal Pvt. Ltd. incurred lot of expenditure in order to penetrate the market
and the agreement was amended w.e.f. 1st April, 2004 vide which the royalty
had been reduced from 7.5% to 3% (copy of the same is placed at page no. 113
of  63 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 the assessee's paper book). In
the preceding year, on the basis of the said amended agreement, the royalty
was charged @ 3%. Therefore, the TPO was not justified in working out the
royalty @ 7.5% as provided in the original agreement dated 05.11.1992 (copy of
which is placed at page nos. 111 & 112 of the assessee's paper book). For the
year under consideration, M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. has not paid any royalty
to the assessee for the reasons that it had to incur the expenses to penetrate
the market. In this regard, vide letter written in May 2005, it was informed
to the assessee that no royalty will be payable from Financial Year 2005-06.
It was also claimed that as per the Clause 7 of the original agreement dated
05.11.1992, the agreement shall become effective only after the approval by
HMG Nepal and shall remain valid for a period of 10 years from the said date,
unless renewed by mutual consent in writing and with prior approval of HMG
Nepal. In the present case, it is not brought on record that the original
agreement dated 05.11.1992 valid for 10 years, was renewed for further period
and approval of HMG Nepal was taken. In the present case, the contention of
the assessee that 80% of the products manufactured by M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt.
Ltd. were purchased by the assessee has not been rebutted. It is also not in
dispute that the royalty was payable earlier on the sales, therefore, it is
unbelievable that the assessee charged the royalty on the purchases made by it
from M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. to increase the cost of purchases. Even if it
is presumed that the royalty was to be charged by the assessee then same
amount was to be added in the purchases thus the impact will be revenue
neutral i.e. on the one hand, income will be increased by crediting the
royalty and on the other hand, the cost of purchases will be increased by the
same amount, since the sale was made by M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. to the
assessee. In the present case, it is an admitted fact that there was no
agreement in existence between the assessee and the AE i.e. M/s Dabur Nepal
Pvt. Ltd. and nothing is brought on record to substantiate that the assessee
incurred any expenditure which benefited M/s Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. in any
manner. Therefore, no royalty was payable to the assessee by M/s Dabur Nepal
Pvt. Ltd. By considering the totality of the facts as discussed here in above,
we are of the view that the royalty @ 2% directed to be charged by the ld.
CIT(A) was not justified, therefore, the addition made on the said basis is
deleted."
[ 81.7 Since the facts of the present appeal are identical to the facts
decided by the Tribunal in assessee's own case in the preceding assessment
year, therefore, in absence of any distinguishable features brought before us
by either side, we, respectfully following the same, hold that no royalty is
receivable by the assessee from Dabur Nepal and, therefore, the order of the
CIT(A) sustaining the addition  64 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 on
account of Royalty receivable from Dabur Nepal (P) Ltd., at 2% is directed to
be deleted. So far as royalty receivable from Dabur International, UAE is
concerned, the same is directed to be restricted to 0.75% as held by the
Tribunal. 81.8. So far as the argument of the ld. Counsel that the order of
the Tribunal cannot be accepted because the same is not based on correct
appreciation of facts is concerned, we do not find any merit in the argument
of the ld. Counsel since as fairly conceded by the ld. Counsel at the time of
hearing before us, the Hon'ble High Court has already dismissed the appeal
filed by the assessee on this very issue.
81.9 So far as the royalty from Asian Consumer Care Pvt. Ltd., Bandladesh is
concerned, we find, the facts and salient features of the agreement are
identical to that of the facts and agreement with Dabur International Ltd.,
UAE. Since the Tribunal has already restricted such royalty to 0.75% in case
of Dabur International Ltd., UAE, therefore, respectfully following the ratio
of the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for the immediately
preceding assessment year while restricting such royalty to 0.75% in case of
Dabur International Ltd., UAE, we restrict the royalty from Asian Consumer
Care Pvt. Ltd., Bangladesh to 0.75%. 81.10 In view of the above discussions,
the grounds relating to the issue of Royalty by the Revenue are dismissed and
the grounds raised by the assessee are partly allowed.
65
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
82\. Ground of appeal No.3 by the Revenue relates to the order of the CIT(A)
in deleting the addition of Rs.96,67,520/- on account of interest on loan
advanced to Dabur International, UAE, an AE.
82.1 Facts of the case, in brief, are that during the course of TP assessment
proceedings, the TPO noted that the assessee had given loans to its AE to the
tune of Rs.27 crores and has charged interest @ 6.75% on Rs.7 crores and
interest @7% on Rs.20 crores. Further, an amount of Rs.17 crores has been
repaid and an amount of Rs.10 crores was outstanding. He noted that the
assessee in the TP study report has applied internal CUP method where the
interest rate charged by Bank of Baroda for commercial papers was 5.675%. The
TPO disagreed with the approach of the assessee and issued a show cause notice
asking the assessee as to why rate of 14% should not be applied instead of 7%
and 6.75%. The assessee objected to the TPO's proposition and made elaborate
argument. 82.2 It was submitted that it has advanced short-term loan (less
than a year) to its foreign AE and the interest charged by the assessee is
more than what it took from the bank and, therefore, the interest charged from
the AE was considered to meet the arm's length principle. It was argued that
it is not the case of the Revenue that the assessee has taken loan from the
bank and gave to its AE at nil rate of interest or lower rate of interest than
what it was paying to the bank. The action of the assessee in the instant case
suits to total arm's length behavior. So far as the financial health of the AE
is concerned, it was submitted that it is only the parent  66 ITA Nos.3241,
3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 company which knows it. It was submitted that the
loan extended to AE was not for very long period of time and was for a short
period of one year or less. Therefore, there was no big risk in offering the
loan to the AE at a rate which is higher than prevailing bank rate.
82.3 However, the TPO was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the
assessee and made upward adjustment of Rs.96,67,520/- by adopting the rate of
14% to be reasonable for benchmarking the arm's length rate. 82.4 In appeal,
the ld.CIT(A), relying on various decisions, deleted the addition made by the
AO/TPO by observing as under:-
> "9.0 Findings 9.1 I have carefully considered the submissions of the
> Appellant. The facts are that Appellant has given loan to Dabur
> International Ltd, UAE and charged an interest rate of 7% and 6.75%. The
> loan/interest transaction was benchmarked by the Appellant in the TP Study
> of AY 2007-08 by application of internal GUP where rate charged by Bank of
> Baroda for Commercial Papers was 5.675%. However, the Ld TPO did not agree
> with the approach of the Appellant and applied the rate of 14%. As per the
> TPO, the benchmarking done the by Appellant is faulty as the Appellant

> Then the Ld TPO proceeded to arrive the LIBOR rates as per details mentioned
> in the TP Order at Page 4 and 5 of the TP Order AY 2007-08. However, TPO has
> not done comparability analysis of loan transaction of the appellant. As per
> Rule 10(B)(2), the comparability of controlled transaction with uncontrolled
> transaction requires comparison on following factors:
> "For the purposes of sub-rule (1), the comparability of [an international
> transaction or a specified domestic transaction] with an uncontrolled
> transaction shall be judged with reference to the following, namely:--
> (a) the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services
> provided in either transaction;
67
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
> (b) the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be
> employed and the risks assumed, by the respective parties to the
> transactions;
(c) the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing)
of the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the
responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions;
(d) conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to
the transactions operate, including the geographical location and size of the
markets, the laws and Government orders in force, costs of labour and capital
in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and
whether the markets are wholesale or retail '' 9.2 Thus, for loan transaction
what is crucial is whether terms and conditions of loan offered in a
controlled transaction can be compared with uncontrolled situation. What it
means here is that whether loan advanced to foreign subsidiary was with
borrowed money, or advanced from internal sources is totally irrelevant for
the determination of ALP u/s 92(1) of the IT Act. Holding this position, in
case of VVF v DCIT ITA No. 673/Mum/06, the Hon'ble Mumbai ITAT held as
follows:
"On a conceptual note, the purpose of making arms length adjustments, in
prices at which which transactions have been entered into with associated
enterprises is to nullify the impact of interrelationship between the
associated enterprises. Unless the basis of which such hypothetical prices are
computed is such that costs are to be taken into account, these hypothetical
prices have nothing to do with the actual costs. CUP method seeks to ascertain
arms length price by taking into account prices at which similar transactions
have been entered into by the assessee with unrelated parties (Internal CUP)
or at which other unrelated parties have entered into similar transactions
inter se (External CUP). None of these inputs have anything to do with the
costs: they only refer to prevailing prices in similar unrelated transactions
instead of adopting the prices at which the transactions have been actually
entered in such cases, the hypothetical arms length prices, at which these
associated enterprises, but for their relationship, would have entered into
the same transaction, are taken into account. Whether the funds are advanced
out of interest bearing funds or out of funds on 14% interest is being paid,
or whether such interest free advances are commercially expedient for the
assessee or not, is wholly irrelevant in this context. The transaction in the
present case is of lending money, in foreign currencies, to its foreign
subsidiaries. The comparable transaction therefore is of foreign currency
lending by unrelated parties."
9.3 Now, what is required to be seen is whether the controlled transaction can
be compared with uncontrolled ones. As the Appellant, the Ld-TPO failed to
apply the test of Rule 10B(2) while recommending an ALP of 14% on interest. At
once place, the TPO arrived interest rate by investment theory in bonds and on
other, he tried to used LIBOR. However, the manner in which the interest  68
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 rates were arrived both under
investment theory or LIBOR theory cannot be said to meet the standards of TP
comparability.
9.4 In the course of submission, the Appellant submitted the prevalent LIBOR
rates during the FY 2006-07 as follows:
                         1-Month        3 - Month    6-Month       12- Month
    LIBOR RATES-         5.3195%        5.3479%      5.312%        5.2009%
    March 2007
The LIBOR rates mentioned above average outs to 5,30%. These LIBOR rates are
used for transaction in international trade. Very recently, in case of Cotton
Naturals (I) Pvt Ltd (supra), Hon Delhi ITAT held as follows:
14\. We note that CUP Method is the most appropriate method in order to
ascertain arms length price of the international transaction as that of the
appellant. We agree with the assesee's contention that where the transaction
was lending money in foreign currency to its foreign subsidiaries the
comparable transactions, therefore, was of foreign currency lended by
unrelated parties. The financial position and credit rating of the
subsidiaries will be broadly same as the holding company. In such a situation,
domestic prime lending rate would have no applicability and the international
rate fixed being LIBOR should be taken as the benchmark rate for the
international transaction "
"17\. We further note that the appellant gas arrangement for loan from
Citibank for less than 4%. However, for loan provided to its AEs it has
charged 4% pa interest. Hence, adjustment suggested by the TPO is not
warranted " In the above ruling of Cotton Naturals (supra) and other rulings
as relied upon the appellant suggest that to benchmark loan transaction in
case of international trade, LIBOR is best measure to compute the ALP u/s 92.
9.5 I find force in the arguments of the Appellant that in case of
international loan given in international currency (USD in case of appellant),
the interest rates to be applied should be LIBOR plus margin. The avg LIBOR
rate for FY 2006-07 is determined at 5.20%. The appellant had charged 7% and
6.75% for the two loans given to Dabur International Ltd UAE, which seems to
be compliant with the requirement for comparability of ALP rates for interest.
Thus, I hold that, interest rate of 14% charged by the Ld. TPO is in
contravention of the Rule 10B(2) and that interest charged by the Appellant at
7% and 6.75% satisfies arm's length principle. Accordingly, this ground is
allowed in favour of the Appellant."

ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 82.5 Aggrieved with such order of the
CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before the Tribunal.
82.6 The ld. DR heavily relied on the orders of the AO/TPO. 82.7 The ld.
Counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, submitted that in the TP
document, the transaction of loan advanced to the AE is benchmarked by
applying CUP method wherein the interest charged by the Bank of Baroda for
commercial papers @ 5.675% has been treated as appropriate internal
uncontrolled transaction. The ld. Counsel drew the attention of the Bench to
clause (a) of Rule 10B(1) of the IT Rules, 1962 and submitted that the said
provision provides for application of CUP method. He submitted that there are
two types of comparable uncontrolled transactions. The first is known as
internal comparable and is a transaction between one of the parties to the
controlled transaction and unrelated third party. The second, known as
external comparable is a transaction between two unrelated third parties. He
submitted that generally specific details regarding internal comparables are
more readily available to the parties engaged in the controlled transaction
than details regarding external comparables. In the light of the above
external CUP should be used with utmost caution and if internal CUP is
available, it is perfect over external CUP.
82.8 Referring to the following decisions, he submitted that internal
comparables available in case of a tax payer ought to be perfect over external
comparables available for benchmarking of international transactions:-  70

He accordingly submitted that since the assessee has charged interest on the
loan @ 6.75%/7% from Dabur International, UAE being higher than the internal
71 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 CUP where the interest rate
charged by Bank of Baroda for commercial papers @ 5.675% has been treated as
appropriate internal uncontrolled transaction, international transaction of
interest received should be considered as being at arm's length applying the
CUP method.
82.10 Without prejudice to the above, he submitted that the interest rate
charged by the assessee is also much higher than the average LIBOR rate of
5.20% and, thus, such transaction of interest received has to be considered as
being at arm's length. He submitted that in the present case, transaction of
lending loan to the AE is in foreign currencies given to foreign AEs.
Accordingly, the comparable transaction for the purpose of applying of CUP
should be considered to be foreign currency lending by unrelated parties with
the LIBOR. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the
case of DCIT vs. Cotton Naturals (I) Pvt. Ltd., 276 CTR 445, he submitted that
the Hon'ble High Court, while upholding the order of the Tribunal has held
that the interest rate should be the market determined interest rate
applicable to the currency concerned in which the loan has to be repaid.
Referring to the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
Bharti Airtel Limited vs. ACIT, 161 TTJ 428, he submitted that in this case
also the Tribunal has held that in a case where loans are advanced in foreign
currency, the interest rate on foreign currency loans being qualitatively
different and accordingly, even if one has to see the interest that the
assessee would have earned, one has to see the interest that the assessee
would have earned on foreign  72 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
currency loans and not rupee denominated loans. He also relied on the
following decisions and submitted that the order of the CIT(A) is fully
justified under the facts and circumstances of the present case:-
(i) Siva Industries and Holdings Ltd. vs. ACIT [ITA No. 2148/Mds/2148];
(ii) Tata Autocomp Systems Ltd. vs. ACIT [ITA No. 7354/Mum/2011],

the assesseedrew the attention of the Bench to the provisions of LIBOR
relevant for F.Y. 2006-07 which is as under:-
                                 1-Month      3-Month      6-Month      12-Month

82.12 Referring to the above, he submitted that the LIBOR rates mentioned
above averages out to 5.20% which is much lower than the rate of interest
charged by the assessee on foreign currency loans advanced to its associated
enterprises. He accordingly submitted that since the assessee has charged
interest much higher than the LIBOR rates, no further adjustment is required.
73
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 82.13 We have considered the rival
arguments made by both the sides, perused the orders of the AO/TPO/CIT(A) and
the paper book filed on behalf of the assessee. We have also considered the
various decisions cited before us. We find, the assessee in the instant case
has disbursed two loans to Dabur International, UAE at the interest rate of
6.5/7% the details of which are given below:-
            Particulars                               Amount (in Rs. crores)
            Loan given @ 6.75%                        Rs.7 crores
            Loan given at 7%                          Rs.20 crores
Less: Repayment of loan during the year (Rs.17 crores) Loan outstanding as on
31.03.2007 10 crores 82.14 During the impugned assessment year, the assessee
has earned interest of Rs.1,05,27,000/- on the aforesaid loans. In the TP
study report the assessee applied internal CUP method where the interest rate
charged by the Bank of Baroda for Commercial Papers was 5.675%. Considering
that the international transaction of receipt of interest from Dabur
International ltd., Dubai at 6.75%/7% was higher than the bank's rate of
interest, the international transaction of interest received was considered to
be at arm's length applying the CUP method. We find, the TPO disregarded the
benchmark analysis undertaken by the assessee for determining the ALP of
interest on loan applying internal CUP method. According to him, for loans
given the rate charged by Indian banks on foreign currency loans is to be
taken as benchmark. Applying the rate of interest of 14% on the basis of data
collected from CRISIL where rate of interest for BBB Bonds for F.Y. 2006-07
was 15.13%, the TPO proposed an addition of Rs.96,67,520 which was added by
the AO to the total income of the assessee on account of interest charged on
loan  74 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 from AEs. We find, the
ld.CIT(A) deleted the addition made by the AO/TPO on the ground that interest
rate to be applied in case of international loan given in international
currency (USD) should be LIBOR + margin. He noted that in the instant case,
the average LIBOR rate for A.Y. 2006-07 was 5.20% whereas the assessee has
charged interest @ 6.75/7% which is much higher than the comparable ALP rates.
He further noted that the TPO while adopting the rate of 14% has contravened
the provisions of Rule 10B(2) which prescribes the factors for comparability
of controlled transactions of uncontrolled transactions. 82.15 We do not find
any infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) deleting the addition made by the
AO/TPO. The provisions of Rule 10B(1)(a) read as under:- "10B . (1) For the
purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's length price in relation
to an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction shall be
determined by any of the following methods, being the most appropriate method,
in the following manner, namely :--
(a) comparable uncontrolled price method, by which,--
> (i) the price charged or paid for property transferred or services provided
> in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions,
> is identified;
> (ii) such price is adjusted to account for differences, if any, between the
> international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the
> comparable uncontrolled transactions or between the enterprises entering
> into such transactions, which could materially affect the price in the open
> market;
> (iii) the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (ii) is taken to be an
> arm's length price in respect of the property transferred or services
> provided in the international transaction or the specified domestic
> transaction ;"
82.16 We find identical issue had come up before the Chennai Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of VVF Ltd. vs. DCIT, vide ITA No.673/Mum/2006 where the
75 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Tribunal in a case involving
transaction of loan advanced to the associated enterprise, has held as under:-
> "We have noted that as was also noted by the Transfer Pricing Officer
> himself at page 3 of his order the appellant has borrowed foreign currency
> loans in US Dollars and for the purposes of investing in subsidiaries
> abroad, from ICICI Bank at the rate of LIBOR + 3% The appellant has also
> filed a letter from Bank of India stating that "during March 2002, we have
> been charging spreads of 150 bps to 300 bps over LIBOR in respect of foreign
> currency loans based on financial position and credit rating of the
> borrower". As for the LIBOR rate, as per the information provided by
> appellant, it ranged from 1.85000 (2 weeks) to 3.00250 (I year). On the
> given facts, in our considered view, it would be appropriate to accept
> internal CUP, i.e. the rate at which the appellant has resorted to foreign
> exchange borrowings from the ICICI, as arms length price under CUP method.
> The fact, as painstaking brought on record by the authorities below that
> this loan from ICICI bank was not used for the purposes of remittance to
> subsidiaries as interest free loans has no bearing for the purposes of
> computing ALP of interest free loan. The financial position and credit
> rating of the subsidiaries will be broadly the same as the holding company,
> and, therefore, the precise rate at which the ICICI Bank has advanced the
> foreign currency loans to the appellant company can be adopted at arm 's
> length price of interest free loans advanced by the appellant company to its
> foreign subsidiaries."
82.17 Since the assessee in the instant case has charged interest on loan @
6.75%/7% from Dabur International, UAE, which is higher than the internal CUP
wherein interest rate charged by Bank of Baroda for Commercial Papers was
5.675%, therefore, the international transaction of interest received, in our
opinion, is considered to be at arm's length applying the CUP method. 82.18 We
find, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of DCIT vs. Cotton Naturals
India (P) Ltd. (supra) while upholding the finding of the Tribunal with
respect to appropriate comparable rate of interest on foreign currency
denominated loan, has held as under:-
76
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "39\. The question whether the
> interest rate prevailing in India should be applied, for the lender was an
> Indian company/assessee, or the lending rate prevalent in the United States
> should be applied, for the borrower was a resident and an assessee of the
> said country, in our considered opinion, must be answered by adopting and
> applying a commonsensical and pragmatic reasoning. H e have no hesitation in
> holding that the interest rate should be the market determined interest rate
> applicable to the currency concerned in which the loan has to be repaid.
> Interest rates should not be computed on the basis of interest payable on
> the currency o r legal tender of the place or the country of residence of
> either party. Interest rates applicable, to loans and deposits in the none
> currency of the borrower or the lender would vary and are dependent upon the
> fiscal policy of the Central bank, mandate if the Government and several
> other parameters. Interest rates payable on currency specific loans/
> deposits are significantly universal and globally applicable. The currency
> in which the loan is to be re-paid normally determines the rate of return on
> the money lent, i.e., the rate of interest."
82.19 We find, the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Bharti
Airtel Limited vs. ACIT: 161 TTJ 428, too, has held that in a case where loans
are advanced in foreign currency, the interest rate on foreign currency loans
being qualitatively different, and accordingly, even if one has to see the
interest that the assessee would have earned, one has to see the interest that
the assessee would have earned on foreign currency loans and not rupee
denominated loans. 82.20 We further find merit in the argument of the ld.
Counsel that the Revenue / TPO himself in the case of Perot Systems TSI
(India) Ltd. Vs. DCIT (2010-TIOL- 51- ITAT-Del.) and in the case of DDIT vs.
Development Bank of Singapore: 144 ITD 265 (Mum), has applied LIBOR rate for
benchmarking of international transaction of loans undertaken with the AE. It
is the settled law that the Revenue has to be consistent in its approach and
it is not open to the Revenue to take an inconsistent stand in the case of
different assessee. [Ref. Kaumudini Narayan  77 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 Dalai: 249 ITR 219 (SC) and Berger Paints India Ltd. vs. CIT:
266 ITR 99 (SC)]. Therefore, consistent with the stand taken by the Revenue in
the case of different assesses, the said filter, in our opinion, is to be
uniformly applied in all cases. 82.21 In view of the above discussion and in
view of the detailed reasoning given by the CIT(A) while deleting the
addition, we do not find any infirmity in his order. Accordingly, the order of
the CIT(A) deleting the addition of Rs.96,67,520/- is upheld and the ground
raised by the Revenue on this issue is dismissed.
83\. In ground of appeal No.6, the Revenue has challenged the order of the
CIT(A) in deleting the addition of Rs.70,49,000/- and directing the AO to
recompute the deduction u/s 80IB and 80IC of the Act without further
allocation of the head office and other expenses to various units eligible for
such deduction. 83.1 Facts of the case, in brief, are that the AO, during the
course of assessment proceedings noted that the assessee has 18 industrial
units undertaking manufacturing of products out of which ten units were
eligible for deduction u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act which are as follows:-
    1)       Jammu Unit-1
    2)       Jammu Unit-2
    3)       Uttranchal Unit
    4)       Chawyanprash- Baddi Unit
                                               78
                                                        ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
    5)    Amla-Honey Baddi Unit
    6)    Glucose- Baddi Unit
    7)    Shampoo- Baddi Unit
    8)    Toothpaste- Baddi Unit
    9)    Honitus- Baddi Unit
    10)   Oral care- Baddi Unit
84\. He noted that the assessee company has declared profit of Rs.28,422.29
lakhs from business on the sales of Rs.1,77,802.43 lakhs and other income of
Rs.1651.17 lakhs which include profit of Rs.30285.30 lakhs raised on the sales
of other income aggregating to Rs.1,11,781.27 lakhs in respect of
manufacturing units of the above units against which the assessee has claimed
deduction of Rs.27,209.71 lakhs u/s 80IB and 80IC. In view of the above facts,
the AO noted that there are loss of Rs.1863.01 lakhs from business activities
of the remaining units. From the various details of the Profit & Loss Account
and Annexure-4 of the respective units accompanying the audit report u/s
80I(7)/80IA(7)/80IB/80IC in Form No.10CCB and its annexures in respect of
units of the above undertakings, the AO noted that transactions of
transfers/sale of stocks of substantial amount/value from and to related units
as well as to corporate office by the assessee company have been reported. The
AO noted that gross total income of the assessee company includes profits of
Rs. 30285.30 lakh with net profit ratio of 26.90% on the sales and other
income of Rs. 112781.27 lakh from the units eligible  79 ITA Nos.3241, 3114,
6525 & 6256/Del/2014 for deduction u/s 80IB and 801C whereas the assessee
company has declared net profit of Rs. 28422.30 lakh on the total sales of Rs.
179453.60 lakh as per consolidated profit & loss account of all the units
resulting in net profit ratio of 15.83% to the total sales of all the units,
therefore, deduction U/s 80IB and 80IC be computed accordingly.
85\. The AO, therefore, asked the assessee to explain the deduction claimed
u/s 80IB/80IC to which the assessee complied. However, the AO disregarded the
arguments advanced by the assessee and allocated certain cost on account of
depreciation and other expenses to the non-taxable zones and accordingly
reduced the claim of deduction u/s 80IB/80IC. As per the details below, the AO
allocated these costs to section 80IB/80IC units:-
          S. No                                      Amount
                    Nature of Expenditure
          1.        Depreciation                     Rs 704.49 lakhs
          2.        Other HO expenses                Rs 2214.02 lakhs
86\. With the above allocations of expenses to section 80IB/80IC units, the
claim of tax holiday was reduced by the AO from Rs.27207.71lakhs to
Rs.25403.88 lakhs thereby making an addition of Rs.1803.83 lakhs.
87\. Before the CIT(A), it was submitted that the depreciation arrived at by
the AO is totally faulty. The AO has taken the difference between depreciation
available under the Income-tax Act and Companies Act and has allocated the
same to tax holiday units. It was submitted that the assessee has also added
Rs.2197.81 lakhs in the computation of income as depreciation under the
Companies Act and,  80 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 similarly, it
has taken deduction of Rs.2903.30 lakhs from the income as depreciation
allowable under the Income-tax Act. The AO has taken the difference of
Rs.704.49 lakhs and allocated to all the units. It was argued that while
working out the deduction available u/s 80IB/80IC in respect of various units,
depreciation as per Companies Act was added back and depreciation as per IT
Act was claimed. Therefore, there is no situation for further allocation of
Rs.70.50 lakhs. Similarly, the assessee had added certain expenses which were
allowable under the provisions of Income-tax Act and, hence, these expenses
were never claimed by the assessee. However, the AO has allocated these
expenses to all units in the ratio of sales percentage thereby reducing the
profits of units. The disallowance as per computation of income was brought to
the notice of the CIT(A) which is as under:-
    "Disallowance as per Computation of Income
             Particulars                    Amount ( Rs Lacs)   Amount (Rs Lacs)
             Misc. Exp Written off
             ESOP Exp                       1035.37
             Technical Know How             18.75               1054.12
             Other Disallowances
             Donation                       414.05
             Provision for Bad Debts        94.85
             Scientific research exp        651.00              1159.90
             Total                                              2214.02."
88\. It was further submitted that ESOP expenses, technical know-how expenses,
donation and provision for bad debts have been added back in the computation
of taxable income by the assessee itself as these were not allowable expenses
under the provisions of the Act. Therefore, these expenses have not been
claimed by the assessee. However, the AO has erroneously allocated these
expenses to all the  81 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 units in the
ratio of sales percentage and accordingly has worked out reduced profits in
respect of tax holiday units. So far as the scientific research expenses is
concerned, it was submitted that the assessee has claimed weighted deduction @
125% u/s 35(1)(ii) of the Act in respect of contribution made to an
association for scientific research. The payment is voluntary in nature and is
not for any specific purpose. Further, these expenditure cannot be allocated
to tax holiday units as it is not connected with such units. Relying on
various decisions and the word used in section 80IC 'derived from' and 'not
attributable to' it was argued that R&D expenses cannot be allocated to units
claiming deduction unless it has a nexus.
89\. Based on the arguments advanced by the assessee, the ld.CIT(A) directed
the AO to recompute the deduction available u/s 80IB/80IC without further
allocation of head office expenses to various units by observing as under:-
> "15.0 Finding:
> 15.1 I have carefully gone through submissions of the appellant and other
> material placed on record. The Appellant has contended that additions made
> on account of HO allocations were already considered at the time of
> computation of income. It has been seen that the appellant itself has added
> back depreciation as Companies Act and has claimed depreciation as per IT
> Act while computing deduction available u/s 80EB/IC. Therefore, the AO has
> wrongly allocated Rs. 704.50 lacs to various units which difference of

> appellant itself has added back certain expenses like ESOP expenses,
> technical know-how expenses, donation and provision for bad debts in

> has not held that these are otherwise allowable expenses. Once the appellant

> 15.3 Regarding scientific research expenses, I find force in contention of

> eligible for  82 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 deduction u/s
> 80IB/IC. The AO has not proved any nexus between these expenses and eligible

> 15.4 In view of above, I direct the AO to recompute the deduction available
> u/s 80IB/IC without further allocation of HO expenses to various units as
> done by him in the impugned assessment order. The grounds of appeal are
> allowed."
90\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.
91\. The ld. DR strongly relied on the order of the AO. The ld. Counsel for
the assessee, on the other hand, relying on the order of the CIT(A), submitted
that in the grounds of appeal preferred by the Revenue, it has only challenged
the deletion of disallowance of Rs.70.49 lakhs as against Rs.704.49 lakhs
which is a typographical error. The ld. Counsel referring to page 67 of Paper
Book-I submitted that during the financial year under consideration,
depreciation aggregating to Rs.2197.81 lakhs was debited to the Profit & Loss
Account. He submitted that in the computation of income, the assessee has
added back the aforesaid depreciation under Companies Act and claimed
depreciation of Rs.2902.3 lakhs in accordance with the provisions of section
32 of the Act which is evident from page 425 of the paper book Volume-II. He
submitted that depreciation as claimed in the return of income was fully
allocated among all the units including eligible units. Therefore, when the
assessee has already disallowed the depreciation under Companies Act and has
only claimed depreciation as  83 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
available under the I.T. Act which was allocated to various units, therefore,
there was no reason on the part of the AO to allocate the difference between
the depreciation charged in the P&L Account and depreciation claimed in the
return of income.
91.1 So far as the allocation of head office expenses is concerned, the ld.
Counsel drew the attention of the Bench to the following table:-
    S. No. Particulars              Amount (in Rs. lakhs)
    1.     Miscellaneous expenses written off   1054.12
           (a) ESOP expenses        1035.37
           (b) Technical know-how 18.75
    2.     Donation                             414.05
    3.     Provision for Bad Debts              94.85
    4.     Scientific research                  651.00
    Total                                       2214.02
92\. Referring to the above, he submitted that miscellaneous expenses written
off, donation and provision for bad debt were suo motu disallowed by the
assessee which is evident as per page 424 of the paper book Volume-II.
Therefore, these expenses cannot be allocated to the eligible units and be
considered for computing deduction u/s 80IB and 80IC of the Act since these
expenses are not claimed as deduction. So far as the scientific research
expenses is concerned, he submitted that these expenses have no nexus with the
units eligible for deduction and, therefore, such expenses cannot be allocated
to eligible units for the purpose of computing deduction u/s 80IB and 80IC of
the Act. For the above proposition, he relied on the decision of the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in the case of Zandu Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd. vs. CIT 305
ITR 366.
84
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
93\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and CIT(A) and the Paper Book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We
find, the assessee, during the year under consideration, had 18 industrial
units undertaking manufacturing of products out of which 10 units were
eligible for deduction u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act, the details of which were
given at para 83 of this order. During the year, the assessee declared profit
and gains from eligible business on the basis of separate books of account and
claimed deduction aggregating to Rs.27,209.71 lakhs u/s 80IB and 80IC of the
Act. According to the AO, the Head Office expenses amounting to Rs.2214.02
lakhs were not allocated to the units. Further, according to the AO,
depreciation to the tune of Rs.704.49 lakhs on assets of the Head Office was
not allocated to the units. Accordingly, the AO allocated the Head Office
expenses and depreciation in the ratio of sales of eligible units for
computing the deduction u/s 80IB/80IC and restricted such deduction to
Rs.25,404.88 lakhs as against Rs.27,207.71 lakhs claimed by the assessee. We
find, the ld.CIT(A) reversed the action of the AO and directed him to
recompute the deduction u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act without further allocation of
head office expenses and depreciation to various units by observing that the
assessee has itself added back the depreciation as per Companies Act, 1956 and
claimed depreciation as per the Act and, therefore, the AO was wrong in
allocating difference of depreciation available under the Companies Act and
the Income-tax Act to the  85 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
eligible units. So far as the head office expenses aggregating to Rs.2,214.02
lakhs is concerned, he noted that expenses aggregating to Rs.1,563.02 lakhs
were suo motu disallowed by the assessee and added back in the computation of
income. Therefore, once these expenses were not claimed by the assessee, the
same cannot be allocated to the eligible units for computation of deduction
u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act. The ld.CIT(A) also further noted that scientific
research expenses of Rs.651 lakhs, which was included in the head office
expenses allocated by the AO are not connected with the units eligible for
deduction u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act and, therefore, cannot be allocated to the
eligible units.
} 93.1 We do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) reversing the
action of the AO in allocating the head office expenses and depreciation to
various eligible units for the purpose of recomputing the deducting u/s
80IB/80IC. The factual finding of the ld.CIT(A) that the assessee has added
back the depreciation as per Companies Act, 1956 and claimed depreciation as
per the Income-tax and, therefore, the AO was wrong in allocating the
difference of depreciation available under the Companies Act and the Income-
tax Act to the eligible units could not be controverted by the ld. DR.
Similarly, the ld. DR also could not controvert the factual finding given by
the CIT(A) that expenses aggregating to Rs.1,563.02 lakhs being head office
expenses were suo motu disallowed by the assessee and added back in the
computation of income and once these expenses were claimed by the assessee,
the same cannot be allocated to the eligible units for computation of
deduction u/s 80IB/80IC and, therefore, cannot be allocated to the eligible
units.  86
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 93.2 A perusal of page 67 of the
paper book Volume I shows that during the financial year under consideration,
depreciation amounting to Rs.2,197.81 lakhs was debited to the P&L Account. A
perusal of the computation of income, copy of which is placed at page 425 of
the paper book Volume II, shows that the assessee has added back the aforesaid
depreciation under Companies Act and claimed depreciation of Rs.2,902.3 lakhs
in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Act. The depreciation
as claimed in the return of income was duly allocated among all the units
including the eligible units. We, therefore, find no infirmity in the order of
the CIT(A) in reversing the action of the AO in allocating the difference of
depreciation available under the Companies Act and Income-tax Act to the
eligible units.
93.3 So far as the Head office expenses are concerned, we find the AO has
allocated the head office expenses of Rs.2,214.02 lakhs the details of which
are as under:-
    S. No. Particulars              Amount (in Rs. lakhs)
    1.     Miscellaneous expenses written off                  1054.12
           (a) ESOP expenses        1035.37
           (b) Technical know-how 18.75
    2.     Donation                                            414.05
    3.     Provision for Bad Debts                             94.85
    4.     Scientific research                                 651.00
    Total                                                      2214.02
93.4 A perusal of page 425 of paper book, Volume-II shows that Miscellaneous
expenses written off, donation and provision for bad debts were suo motu
disallowed by the assessee in its return of income. Therefore, once the
aforesaid  87 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 expenses were not
claimed as a deduction by the assessee, the same, in our opinion, cannot be
allocated to the eligible units and be considered for computing the deduction
u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act.
93.5 So far as scientific research expenses of Rs.651 lakhs is concerned, the
finding of the ld. CIT(A) that such expenses have no nexus with the units
eligible for deduction has not been controverted by the Revenue. We find, the
Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Zandu Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd. vs.
CIT, 350 ITR 366 (Bom) has held that once the expenses have no nexus with the
units eligible for deduction, such expenses cannot be allocated to units for
the purpose of computing deduction u/s 80IB/80IC of the Act. Since the
scientific research expenses of Rs.651 lakhs which were included in the head
office expenses allocated by the AO are not connected with the units eligible
for deduction u/s 80IB/80IC, the same, in our opinion, cannot be allocated to
the eligible units. In this view of the matter, the order of the CIT(A) is
upheld and the ground raised by the Revenue on this issue is dismissed.
94\. In ground of appeal No.7, the Revenue has challenged the order of the
CIT(A) in deleting the addition of Rs.4,09,871/- in respect of belated
payments of employees contribution to ESI which was treated u/s 36(1)(va) of
the Act r.w. section 2(24)(10) of the Act.
95\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the AO, during the course of
assessment proceedings, observed from the Form 3CD annexed to the audit report
that the  88 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 assessee company has
deposited the employees contribution to ESIC after the due date as per the
respective Act the correct amount of which comes to Rs.4,09,871/-. Applying
the provisions of section 2(24)(x) r.w. section 36 (1)(va), the AO added the
same to the total income of the assessee.
95.1 In appeal, the ld.CIT(A), following the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of CIT vs. AIMIL Ltd., reported in 321 ITR 508, deleted
the addition on the ground that the assessee has deposited the above amount
well before the due date of filing the tax return.
96\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.
97\. The ld. DR submitted that the ld.CIT(A) is not justified in deleting the
addition when the assessee has not paid the statutory dues of employees'
contribution to ESIC before the specified date under the said Act.
98\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, submitted that
although the assessee has deposited employees' contribution to ESIC after the
due date specified in the Act, but, it has deposited such deposits before the
due date of filing of the return u/s 139(1) of the Act. Referring to the
decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for the immediately preceding
assessment year, the ld. Counsel submitted that the Tribunal at para 68 of the
order has decided the issue in favour of the assessee and dismissed the ground
raised by the Revenue on this  89 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
issue by following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
CIT vs. Alom Extrusions Ltd., reported in 2009 TIOL-125-SC-IT. Referring to
the decision of the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court in the case of DCIT vs.
Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Ltd., reported in 250 Taxman 32, he
submitted that when PF and ESI was paid before the due date of filing of
returns, the same could not be disallowed under section 43B or under section
36(1)(va). He submitted that the SLP filed by the Revenue has been dismissed
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 84 taxmann.com 285. Referring to copy
of letter dated 10.09.2018 addressed by Pr. Director of Income-tax (Legal and
Research), New Delhi regarding filing of appeal in cases involving issue of
allowability of deduction of employees' contribution to PF and ESIC copy of
which is placed at page 442 and 443 of the paper book, he submitted that the
Department should not have filed appeal on this issue.
99\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO/CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We
find, the AO, in the instant case, made addition of Rs.4,09,871/- u/s
36(1)(va) r.w.s. 2(24)(x) of the Act on the ground that the employees'
contribution to ESIC were deposited much after the specified dates mentioned
in the said Act. We find, the ld.CIT(A) deleted the addition on the ground
that although such payments were made /deposited after the due date prescribed
in the ESI Act, however, such deposits were made prior to the  90 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 date of filing of the return u/s 139(1).
We find, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. Bharat Hotels
Ltd., reported in (2019) 410 ITR 417 has held that Employees' State Insurance
Corporation and Provident Fund dues paid beyond prescribed period is not an
allowable deduction. Since the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has decided the
identical issue against the assessee which is after the date of SLP dismissed
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation
Ltd. (supra) and since the decision of the jurisdictional High Court is
binding on us, therefore, the various other decisions relied on by the ld.
Counsel for the assessee cannot be followed. In this view of the matter, the
order of the ld.CIT(A) is reversed and the ground raised by the Revenue is
allowed.
100\. In Ground of appeal No.8 the Revenue has challenged the order of the
CIT(A) in deleting the disallowance of Rs.1,57,45,700/- made u/s 14A of the
Act r.w. Rule 8D of the IT Rules.
101\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the AO, during the course of
assessment proceedings, observed that the assessee has shown tax free dividend
income of Rs.30,000/- and profit of Rs.2,41,98,721/- on sale of shares of M/s
Dabur Pharma Ltd. and claimed as exempt with regard to expenses incurred
relating to income which does not form part of the total income i.e., exempted
income. He, therefore, asked the assessee to explain as to why deduction u/s
14A r.w. Rule 8D should not be allowed. Rejecting the explanation given by the
assessee and applying the  91 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
provision of Rule 14A r.w. Rule 8D, the AO made disallowance of
Rs.1,57,45,700/- and added the same to the total income of the assessee.
102\. In appeal, the ld.CIT(A) directed the AO to delete the addition on the
ground that no satisfaction was recorded by the AO u/s 14A(2) of the Act
regarding the incorrectness of the claim made by the assessee. Further, no
disallowance of interest on borrowed funds could be made u/s 14A of the Act in
case of mixed pool of funds as it is not possible to ascertain whether there
exists any nexus between borrowed funds and tax free funds. The relevant
observations of the ld.CIT(A) reads as under:-
> "24.1 I have gone through the submissions of the Appellant The facts are
> that the Appellant had not disallowed any expenditure u/s 14A on its own.
> The Appellant had contended that apart from investment in equity shares of
> Dabur Pharma Ltd., none of its investments could have earned tax free
> returns u/s 10 of the Act so as to disallow the expenditure u/s 14 A. Only
> dividend income of Rs. 30,000 which is exempt has been earned during the
> period under consideration and no expenses have been incurred to earn this
> income.

103\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.

ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
104\. The ld. DR heavily relied on the order of the AO. The ld. Counsel, on
the other hand, while supporting the order of the CIT(A) submitted that Rule
8D could not have been applied mechanically more so when the said Rule is not
applicable to the year under consideration. Further, only investment yielding
dividend income has to be considered for the purpose of making disallowance.
He submitted that interest expenditure, if any, relatable to dividend yielding
investment has to be considered and disallowance cannot exceed the exempt
income. For the above proposition, the ld. Counsel relied on various decisions
as mentioned in the written synopsis.
105\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered various decisions cited before us. We find,
the AO, in the instant case, disallowed an amount of Rs.1,57,45,700/- u/s 14A
r.w. rule 8D on the ground that the assessee has earned tax free dividend
income of Rs.30,000/0 and profit of Rs.2,41,98,721/- on sales of shares of M/s
Dabur Pharma Ltd. Further, the assessee has incurred huge interest
expenditure. We find, the ld.CIT(A) deleted the addition the reasons for which
have already been reproduced in the preceding paragraphs. It is the submission
of the ld. Counsel that the assessee had received dividend income of
Rs.30,000/- only from shares held in Dabur Pharma Ltd. which was claimed as
exempt u/s 10(34) of the Act. Further, Rule 8D could not have been applied
mechanically, more so, when the said Rule is  95 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
6256/Del/2014 not applicable to the year under consideration. It is also his
submission that only investment yielding dividend income has to be considered
for the purpose of making disallowance u/s 14A and interest expenditure, if
any, eligible relatable to dividend yielding investment has to be considered.
The alternate argument of the ld. Counsel for the assessee is that
disallowance, if any, cannot exceed the exempt income as held by various
decisions.
106\. Since the assessment year involved in the impugned appeal is 2007-08,
therefore, provisions of Rule 8D cannot be applied for the impugned assessment
year as held in various decisions. Further, it has been held in various
decisions that provisions of section 14A are applicable only if the assessing
officer at the first place finds that the assessee has actually incurred
expenses which have proximate nexus with earning of dividend income and not
otherwise. However, in the instant case, there is no such recording of
satisfaction, therefore, we find some force in the argument of the ld. Counsel
that in absence of recording of any satisfaction, provisions of section 14A
cannot be applied mechanically. Further, the interest expenditure, if any,
relatable to dividend yielding investment has to be considered as held in
various decisions. It is also held in various decisions that only investments
yielding dividend income has to be considered for the purpose of making
disallowance u/s 14A. Under these circumstances, we are of the considered
opinion that the AO was not justified in applying the provisions of section
14A r.w. Rule 8D and disallow an amount of Rs.1,57,45,700/- u/s 14A r.w.  96
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Rule 8D as against the actual
dividend income of Rs.30,000/-. It has been held in various decisions that the
disallowance cannot exceed the exempt income. Since the assessee in the
instant case has earned dividend income of only Rs.30,000/- during the
impugned assessment year, therefore, following the decision of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of Joint Investment Pvt. Ltd. vs. CIT, 372 ITR
694 where it has been held that disallowance u/s 14A cannot exceed exempt
income and the SLP filed by the Revenue has been dismissed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, we accept the alternate contention of the assessee that the
disallowance cannot exceed the actual dividend income. We accordingly hold
that the disallowance u/s 14A has to be restricted to Rs.30,000/-. The ground
raised by the Revenue is accordingly partly allowed.
107\. In ground of appeal No.9, the Revenue has challenged the order of the
CIT(A) in directing the AO to allow depreciation @ 25% of the goodwill which
were not shown by the assessee as its assets.
108\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee company, vide its
letter dated 13th December, 2010, claimed depreciation on goodwill paid on
Balsara Home Product Ltd. and Besta Cosmetics Ltd. and one subsidiary, namely,
Balsara Hygence Ltd. under the scheme of merger approved by the High Courts of
Delhi and Bombay w.e.f. 1st April, 2006. Since the assessee company has not
taken the payment of goodwill in its intangible and has shown as adjusted
against capital reserve and share premium account, therefore, the AO held that
the same is not  97 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 allowable. He
further noted that the assessee has not claimed the same in the return of
income. The AO, therefore, rejected the claim of depreciation on goodwill.
109\. In appeal, the ld.CIT(A) allowed the claim of the assessee by observing
as under:-
> "27\. Finding:
> 27.1 I have gone through various submissions of the appellant and the facts
> of the case. Pursuant to the Delhi and Mumbai High Court's order, Balsara
> Group of companies (Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, Besta Cosmetics Ltd and
> Balsara Horae Products Ltd) merged with appellant company w.e.f. 01-04-
> 2006\. The Appellant contends that it has paid an excess of Rs 158.75 crores

98
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Explanation 5.- For the removal of
doubts, it is hereby declared that the provisions of this sub¬section shall
apply whether or not the assessee has claimed the deduction in respect of
depreciation in computing his total income;
27.3 I have gone through the contentions made by the Appellant. I agree with
contention of the appellant that manner of making entry in books of accounts
cannot determine the statutory liability under Income Tax Act, Accordingly,
the point of AO that the Appellant had not booked excess payment in its books
of a/c as goodwill is not tenable.
27.4 The issue to be adjudicated here is whether the excess payment over and
above net assets made as cost of merger is in nature of goodwill. The
Appellant contended that even if the amount of excess paid over net assets is
knocked off against general reserves and share premium, the fact remains that
the excess was paid to acquire the complete business of the Balsara and that
valuation of intangibles (such as marketing, brand, customer list, supply
chain network, vendors, human resources etc) was inbuilt in the price paid to
Balsara. The fact that Balsara had built its business over a period of time,
it has definitely acquired goodwill not stated in the books. The Appellant had
not to start , the business from scratch relating to Balsara products and with
its ready market for products, sales and profit could have accrued to the
Appellant from the very beginning. Now to acquire a running business with an
established turnover and brand, there had to be some premium paid over the net
assets. The Appellant contended that the premium paid is nothing but goodwill
within the meaning of explanation 3(b) of section 32(1). 27.5 In my view,
there is a force in the arguments of the Appellant. The excess amount paid
over net assets of Rs 158.75 crores is in nature of goodwill as the same was
paid to acquire complete business of Balsara including marketing intangible,
brands, human resources, supply chain network, customers, vendors etc.
Goodwill here is in fact, sum total of all commercial and business rights of
Balsara group which the appellant acquired after merger with Balsara group
companies. I have carefully gone through scheme of amalgamation / merger as
approved by Bombay / Delhi High Court As per this scheme, assets and
liabilities of amalgamating companies were to be carried / recorded in books
of the appellant company at book value and cost of merger was to be set off
against general reserve and share premium accounts of the appellant company.
Therefore, as per scheme of merger approved by Hon'ble High Courts, excess
payment / cost of merger was not to be booked as goodwill a/c. This accounting
practice is also as per AS-14 prescribed by ICAI for accounting procedure of
amalgamation. Facts of the case of CIT v SMIFS Securities Ltd. (supra) are
essentially similar to facts of the present case. Accordingly, I hold that the
excess paid over net assets amounting to Rs 158.75 crores is in nature of
goodwill within the meaning of section 32(1) of the Act r.w. explanation 3(b).
99
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 27.6 It's trite law that the AO is
bound to complete assessment as per the provisions of the Act The Appellant
pointed out to the AO in course of assessment proceedings that depreciation of
goodwill should be allowed to it in view of explanation 5 of section 32(1) of
the Act which was ignored by the AO. Once it is held that excess payment is in
nature of goodwill, in view provisions of explanation 5 of section 32,(1), the
allowance of depreciation is mandatory even if not claimed by the appellant in
its return of income. Accordingly, I direct the AO to allow depreciation @ 25%
on the goodwill. With this, the ground of appeal is allowed."
110\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.
111\. The ld. DR, strongly challenged the order of the CIT(A) in allowing the
depreciation on goodwill on the ground that the assessee has not shown the
payment of goodwill in its intangible assets and has adjusted against its
reserves and share premium and, therefore, the same is not allowable
especially when the assessee has not claimed the same in the return of income.
112\. The ld. Counsel, on the other hand, strongly supported the order of the
CIT(A). He submitted that the consideration of Rs.168.47 crores was paid by
the assessee to acquire Balsara Business, being BHPL (Balsara Hygiene Products
Limited), Balsara Cosmetics Ltd. and Balsara Home Products Ltd. However, the
net worth of these three companies was only 9.72 crores and the balance amount
of Rs.l58.75 crores represents intangibles and other factors. Thereafter, as
part of integration of the newly acquired Balsara business, the said companies
were amalgamated with the assessee. The ld. Counsel for the assessee drew the
attention  100 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 of the Bench to the
salient features of the scheme of amalgamation which are as follows:
(i) The scheme was sanctioned by the High Court of Delhi on 12.09.2006 with
effect from April 1, 2006, being the appointed date of the merger;
(ii) All the assets and liabilities of Balsara companies shall stand
transferred to the assessee at their respective book value as appearing in the
books of the transferee companies [Clause 6.1(c)];
(iii) The difference between the value of shares issued by the assessee and
book value of net assets taken over shall be debited to Share Premium Account,
Capital Redemption Account and General Reserve Account and the balance if any
shall be adjusted against accumulated credit balance in the profit & loss
account [Clause 6.1(e)];
113\. He submitted that in accordance with the scheme of amalgamation, the
assessee recorded the assets and liabilities of the amalgamating companies at
their respective book value. The difference between the consideration of Rs.
168.47 crores paid by the assessee to acquire BHPL, Balsara Home Products
Limited and BCL and net worth of Rs.9.72 crores, being Rs. 158.75 crores
represented intangibles and other factors in the form of goodwill, which was,
in accordance with the scheme of amalgamation, adjusted by the assessee in its
books of accounts as follows:
a) Adjusted against share premium account - Rs.58.36 crores  101 ITA Nos.3241,
3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
b) Adjusted against general reserve account- Rs. 100.40 crores
114\. Referring to the notes to accounts of the audit report, he submitted
that the aforesaid facts were also duly stated in the Notes to Accounts,
appended to the audited accounts. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted
that the excess consideration of Rs. 158.75 crores was paid by the assessee to
acquire various intangibles of Balsara group of companies, being brand and
other commercial rights, all referred to as goodwill. He submitted that
"Goodwill" described as such, is a compendious of various intangible business
and commercial rights resulting in whole advantage to the business, which may
be on account of various factors like location, contracts, personnel including
management experience/ history, existing customer base, licenses, trade name/
logo, etc. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the following
factors justify "goodwill" of Balsara business:
> "a) Balsara Group was established in the year 1925. The group companies
> mainly focuses on manufacturing oral care products, insect repellents, air
> fresheners and household cleaners with Odonil, Odomes, Sani Fresh as its
> famous products;
> b) Balsara Group had gained a commendable position in both domestic and
> international markets by producing natural, herbal, fluoride, baking soda,
> tartar-
> control, gel, sensitive teeth and children's toothpaste formulations. Some
> of the famous toothpaste of the companies are New Babool, Meswak, etc;
> c) Balsara's toothpastes are also very popular in global markets including
> Russia, Ukraine, CIS, Middle East, Fiji and African markets.
102
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
d) Research and product development- Research and Product Development is a
major strength and competitive advantage of the Balsara Group. Balsara's
state-of-the-art Research Center, located in Thane, has been recognized by the
Government of India.
e) Manufacturing and supply chain- Balsara's manufacturing hubs are located at
Silvassa, Kanpur and Baddi. Balsara's manufacturing facilities are approved by
the FDA, Pollution Control Board and other authorities.
f) Human Resources and marketins- Balsara Group's corporate, manufacturing,
sales, distribution and administrative operations are professionally managed.
g) Balsara Group produces branded products of world-class standard as well as
Private Label products and markets them in both the Indian and international
markets at relatively competitive rates. The Balsara group is also engaged in
manufacturing herbal extracts and complexes under some leading worldwide
brands of natural cosmetics namely The Body Shop etc. The Balsara Group has
manufactured Private Label products for some large-scale companies such as
Colgate Palmolive, Beecham Group, Henkel Cosmetics and Reckitt & Coleman.
h) Balsara has a wide national sales and distribution system that makes
products available in 700,000 retail outlets. The system is supported by a
distribution network of 4 Zonal Offices, 10 Branches, 23 Regional Warehouses,
and 1700 Distributors in 1500 towns."
103
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 114.1 The ld. Counsel for the
assessee submitted that brand is a special intangible that in many businesses
it is the most important asset. This is because of the economic impact that
brands have. They influence the choices of customers, employees, investors and
the government authorities. In a world of abundant choices, such influence is
crucial for the commercial success and creation of shareholder value
especially in case of companies engaged in FMCG products, brand plays a very
important role contributing towards the overall business value. The major
sales of such companies depend upon their brand name. He submitted that in the
FMCG sector, one needs to be fast in translating the ideas into new products.
There is a requirement to create the products that people trust, enjoy and use
in their daily lives. Advertising and marketing have a vital role to play in
this. People now are getting more & more health conscious and are getting
concerned about what they are using. They buy only those products which are of
a good quality and are of a reliable brand.
114.2 He submitted that the products offered by Balsara companies are of a
good standard quality and reliable which is the main factor contributing to
the why people prefer buying its products. He submitted that Balsara brand was
well established. To build such a brand, it takes a lot of effort, time and
energy. A lot of time goes into building up a good brand name. There are very
few branded products like Procter and Gamble, Colgate, Godrej, etc. Brand
creates entry barriers and is created over the years. A new player, who enters
a market, also  104 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 needs to spend
time, energy and effort to build its name in the market. Thus a new player can
break a market only over a period of time. The assessee, thus, acquired
substantial intangibles/ commercial rights in the form of a well-established
brand, i.e., "Balsara" along with its marketing strength, technological
strength, distribution network, the human workforce, etc., elaborately
discussed supra. He accordingly submitted that there can be no dispute,
whatsoever, that the excess consideration of Rs. 158.76 cr., being excess of
consideration over the net assets, was on account of various intangibles/
commercial rights, being referred to as goodwill of the Balsara companies.
114.3 The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that goodwill fundamentally
represents the intrinsic worth of the business of the Transferor Companies
inasmuch as the valuation of existing business is much more than the fair
value of the existing tangible assets and the difference, in fact,
fundamentally reflects the value of intangible assets (like, business and
commercial rights, goodwill, licences, trade mark, etc.) not reflected in the
books of the amalgamating companies. 114.4 He drew the attention of the Bench
to provisions of Section 32 of the Act which deals with depreciation allowance
on tangible and intangible assets used for the purposes of business. He
submitted that clause (ii) of the aforesaid section provides for depreciation
on intangible assets acquired on or after 1.4.1998. The aforesaid clause
provides for depreciation on intangible assets in the nature of, inter alia,
"know-how", "patent", "copy rights", "trade mark", "license" and  105 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "franchise". The aforesaid category of
intangible asset is succeeded by the residual category, viz., intangible
assets being "business or commercial rights of similar nature". He submitted
that the amount representing the excess of consideration paid over the fair
value net assets of Transferor Company(ies), recognised as goodwill, fall
within the ambit of the expression "business or commercial rights of similar
nature", so as to qualify for depreciation under section 32 of the Act.
Referring to the following decisions, he submitted that depreciation is
allowable on goodwill:-

the following decisions, he submitted that the entries made in the books of
account are not determinative of the ambit of taxation. If an item of  107 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 income/expenditure is taxable/deductible,
the same has to be taken into account as per the provisions of the Act and not
as per books of account:-
i) Kedarnath Jute Manufacturing Company vs. CIT, 82 ITR 363 (SC);
ii) Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd. vs. CIT, 116 ITR 1 (SC);
iii) Bharat Carbon and Ribbon Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. vs. CIT, 239 ITR 505 (SC);
iv) CIT vs. UP Electronics Corporation Ltd., 282 ITR 470 (All) 114.6 We have
considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused the orders of
the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the assessee. We
have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We find, the AO,
in the instant case, disallowed the claim of depreciation on goodwill on the
ground that the assessee has not shown the payment of goodwill in its
intangible assets and has adjusted it against the reserves and share premium
and the assessee has also not claimed depreciation on goodwill in the return
of income and, therefore, the same is not allowable. We find, the ld.CIT(A)
allowed the claim of depreciation on goodwill as claimed by the assessee the
reasons of which have already been reproduced in the preceding paragraphs. It
is the submission of the ld. DR that when the assessee has not claimed such
depreciation in the return of income and has not shown the payment of goodwill
in its intangible assets and has adjusted it against the reserves and share
premiums, therefore, the ld.CIT(A) is not justified in allowing the claim of
depreciation on goodwill. It is the submission of the ld. Counsel for the
assessee that the difference between the consideration paid  108 ITA Nos.3241,
3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 by the assessee to acquire the business and net
worth of the companies acquired by it represents the intangibles and other
factors in the form of goodwill which were in accordance with the scheme of
amalgamation. It is his submission that the amount representing the excess of
consideration of Rs.158.75 crores paid over the fair value of net assets of
transferor companies recognized as goodwill fall within the ambit of the
expression 'business or commercial rights of similar nature' so as to qualify
for depreciation u/s 32 of the IT Act.
114.7 We find, force in the above argument of the ld. Counsel for the
assessee. We find, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Smifs
Securities Ltd. (supra) while discussing an identical issue has observed as
under:-
> "1\. None appears for the respondent, though served. Heard learned counsel
> for the Department. Leave granted. This civil appeal concerns the Assessment
> Year 2003-2004. Three questions arise for determination by this Court. They
> are as follows:
> Question No.[a]: "Whether Stock Exchange Membership Cards are assets
> eligible for depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961?
> Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, deletion of
> Rs.53,84,766/- has been made correctly?"
> Answer: Learned Additional Solicitor General fairly concedes that the said
> question is covered by the decision of this Court in the case of Techno
> Shares and Stocks Limited vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, reported in [2010]
> 327 I.T.R. 323, in favour of the assessee.
> Question No.[b]: "Whether goodwill is an asset within the meaning of Section
> 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and whether depreciation on `goodwill' is
> allowable under the said Section?"
> Answer: In the present case, the assessee had claimed deduction of
> Rs.54,85,430/- as depreciation on goodwill. In the course of hearing, the
> explanation regarding origin of such goodwill was given as under:
109
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "In accordance with Scheme of
> Amalgamation of YSN Shares & Securities (P) Ltd with Smifs Securities Ltd
> (duly sanctioned by Hon'ble High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta) with
> retrospective efect from 1st April, 1998, assets and liabilities of YSN
> Shares & Securities (P) Ltd were transferred to and vest in the company. In
> the process goodwill has arisen in the books of the company."
2\. It was further explained that excess consideration paid by the assessee
over the value of net assets acquired of YSN Shares and Securities Private
Limited [Amalgamating Company] should be considered as goodwill arising on
amalgamation. It was claimed that the extra consideration was paid towards the
reputation which the Amalgamating Company was enjoying in order to retain its
existing clientele.
3\. The Assessing Officer held that goodwill was not an asset falling under
Explanation 3 to Section 32(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [`Act', for short].
We quote hereinbelow Explanation 3 to Section 32(1) of the Act: "Explanation
3.-- For the purposes of this sub-section, the expressions `assets' and `block
of assets' shall mean-- [a] tangible assets, being buildings, machinery, plant
or furniture;
[b] intangible assets, being know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks,
licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar
nature."
4\. Explanation 3 states that the expression `asset' shall mean an intangible
asset, being know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, franchises
or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature. A reading the
words `any other business or commercial rights of similar nature' in clause
(b) of Explanation 3 indicates that goodwill would fall under the expression
`any other business or commercial right of a similar nature'. The principle of
ejusdem generis would strictly apply while interpreting the said expression
which finds place in Explanation 3(b).
5\. In the circumstances, we are of the view that `Goodwill' is an asset under
Explanation 3(b) to Section 32(1) of the Act.
6\. One more aspect needs to be highlighted. In the present case, the
Assessing Officer, as a matter of fact, came to the conclusion that no amount
was actually paid on account of goodwill. This is a factual finding. The
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [`CIT(A)', for short] has come to the
conclusion that the authorised representatives had filed copies of the Orders
of the High Court ordering amalgamation of the above two Companies; that the
110 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 assets and liabilities of M/s.
YSN Shares and Securities Private Limited were transferred to the assessee for
a consideration; that the difference between the cost of an asset and the
amount paid constituted goodwill and that the assesseeCompany in the process
of amalgamation had acquired a capital right in the form of goodwill because
of which the market worth of the assessee- Company stood increased. This
finding has also been upheld by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal [`ITAT', for
short]. We see no reason to interfere with the factual finding.
7\. One more aspect which needs to be mentioned is that, against the decision
of ITAT, the Revenue had preferred an appeal to the High Court in which it had
raised only the question as to whether goodwill is an asset under Section 32
of the Act. In the circumstances, before the High Court, the Revenue did not
file an appeal on the finding of fact referred to hereinabove.
8\. For the afore-stated reasons, we answer Question No.[b] also in favour of
the assessee. Question No.[c]:"
114.8 We find, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Areva T&D India
Ltd. vs. DCIT, reported in 345 ITR 421 (Del) has held that specified
intangible assets, viz, business claims, business information, business
records, contracts, employees and know-how acquired by assessee under slump
sale agreement are in nature of "business or commercial rights of similar
nature" specified in section 32(1(ii) and are accordingly eligible for
depreciation under that section. The various other decisions relied on by the
ld. Counsel for the assessee also supports his case that depreciation is
allowable on goodwill.
114.9 So far as the case of the Revenue that goodwill was not shown by the
assessee as its assets is concerned, it is the settled proposition of law that
the entries made in the books of account are not determinative of the ambit of
taxation. If an item of income/expenditure is taxable/deductible, the same has
to be taken into account as per the provisions of the Act and not as per the
book entries. We  111 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 also find merit
in the argument of the ld. Counsel for the assessee that in terms of
Explanation 5 to section 32 of the Act, it is now mandatory to claim/allow
depreciation, whether or not the assessee has claimed the same. Therefore, we
are of the considered opinion that the AO should not have refused to consider
the claim of depreciation despite the fact that the assessee raised such claim
vide its letter dated 13.12.2010 addressed to the AO. In this view of the
matter and in view of the detailed reasoning given by the CIT(A) on this
issue, we find no infirmity in his order allowing claim of depreciation on
goodwill. The order of the ld.CIT(A) on this issue is accordingly upheld and
the ground raised by the Revenue on this issue is accordingly dismissed.
115\. Now, coming to the additional ground of appeal, we find, the assessee in
the impugned assessment year has raised the following additional ground:-
> "That the ESOP expenses of Rs. 10,35,36,606/- debited in the Profit & Loss
> Account ought to have been allowed as deduction in computing the income
> under the head 'Profit and Gains of Business."
115.1 The Id. Counsel for the assessee, referring to the above additional
ground, submitted that this ground deserves to be admitted in order to
correctly assess the tax liability of the assessee in accordance with the
provisions of law. He submitted that the above ground does not require any new
fact or other than the facts already on record. Referring to the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of NTPC vs. CIT, 229 ITR 383, he
submitted that the Tribunal has wide powers to admit an additional ground
which is necessary to determine the tax liability of an  112 ITA Nos.3241,
3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 assessee in accordance with law if the related
facts are already on record. Referring to the following decisions, he
submitted that this ground is purely a legal ground placed on the following
decisions:-
> i) Biocon Ltd. Vs DCIT reported at 155 TTJ 649 (Bang. SB)
> ii) Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd. Vs Addl. CIT in ITA No. 4588/Del/2013 order dated
> 23.06.2014 (Del. IT AT)
> iii) CIT Vs Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd. in I TA No. 107/2015 order dated
> 18.08.2015 (Del. H.C.)
> iv) CIT Vs PVP Ventures Ltd. 90 DTR 340 (Mad.) 115.2 He accordingly
> submitted that since the additional ground is purely legal in nature and all
> facts are available on record, therefore, the additional ground should be
> admitted. Referring to the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case
> for the immediately preceding assessment year, he submitted that identical
> additional ground was raised by the assessee before the Tribunal and the
> Tribunal after considering the arguments made by both the sides, has
> admitted the said additional ground and restored the issue to the file of
> the AO/TPO to decide the issue in accordance with the law, after providing
> due opportunity of being heard to the assessee.
115.3 The Id. DR, on the other hand, strongly objected to the admission of the
additional ground.
115.4 We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
113 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 assessee. We have also considered
the various decisions cited before us. We find, the assessee in the instant
case, has raised the additional ground before the Tribunal relating to the
ESOP expenses which were debited in the Profit & Loss Account, but, added back
while computing the income under some misconception of facts and law. However,
the issue, in our opinion, is legal in nature. We find, identical issue had
come up before the Tribunal in ITA No.3257/Del/2013 (by the Assessee) and ITA
No.3492/Del/2013 (by the Revenue) and the Tribunal vide order dated 12.04.2017
for A.Y. 2006-07 has admitted the additional ground and has restored the issue
to the file of the AO for deciding the issue in accordance with law, after
giving due opportunity of being heard to the assessee. The relevant
observations of the Tribunal read as under:-
> "87\. We have considered the submissions of both the parties and carefully
> gone through the material available on the record. It is noticed that the
> additional ground has been raised by the assessee relating to the ESOP
> expenses which were debited in the profit and loss account but added back
> while computing the income allegedly under some misconception of facts and
> law. The issue raised by the assessee is a legal issue.
> 88\. As regard to the admission of the legal ground, the Hon'ble Supreme
> Court in the case of National Thermal Power Company Ltd. Vs CIT (1998) 229
> ITR 383 (supra) held as under:
> "The power of the Tribunal in dealing with appeals is thus expressed in the
> widest possible terms. The purpose of the assessment proceedings before the
> taxing authorities is to assessee correctly the tax liability of an assessee
> in accordance with law. If, for example, as a result of a judicial decision
> given while the appeal is pending before the Tribunal, it is found that a
> non- taxable item is taxed or a permissible deduction is denied, there is no
> reason why the assessee should be prevented from raising that question
> before the Tribunal for the first time, so long as the relevant facts are on
> record in respect of the item. There is no reason to restrict the power of
> the Tribunal under section 254 only to decide the grounds which arise from
> the order of the Commission of Income-tax (Appeals). Both the assessee as
> well as the  114 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Department have a
> right to file an appeal/cross-objections before the Tribunal. The Tribunal
> should not be prevented from considering questions of law arising in
> assessment proceedings, although not raised earlier. The view that the
> Tribunal is confined only to issues arising out of the appeal before the
> Commissioner (Appeals) is too narrow a view to take of the powers of the
> Tribunal."
> It has further been held that:
> "Undoubtedly, the Tribunal has the discretion to allow or not to allow a new
> ground to be raised. But where the Tribunal is only required to consider the
> question of law arising from facts which are on record in the assessment
> proceedings, there is no reason why such a question should not be allowed to
> be raised when it is necessary to consider that question in order to
> correctly assess the tax liability of an assessee."
> 89\. We, therefore, by keeping in view the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
> Supreme Court in the aforesaid referred to case admit the additional ground
> raised by the assessee. However, it is an admitted fact that this issue has
> been raised by the assessee first time and the authorities below had no
> occasion to deal with this issue. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to
> remand this issue to the file of the AO/TPO to be decided in accordance with
> law after providing due and reasonable opportunity of being heard to the
> assessee."
115.5 Since the facts of the impugned assessment year are identical to the
facts of the case decided by the Tribunal in assessee's own case in the
immediately preceding assessment year, therefore, respectfully following the
decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own case we admit the additional ground
and restore the issue to the file of the AO with a direction to adjudicate the
issue in accordance with the law, after giving due opportunity of being heard
to the assessee. We hold and direct accordingly. The additional ground raised
by the assessee is accordingly allowed for statistical purposes.
ITA No.6256/Del/2014 (By the Revenue - A.Y. 2008-09)
116\. The grounds raised by the Revenue are as under:-
115
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "On the facts in the circumstances

ITA No.6525/Del/2014 ( by the Assessee - A.Y. 2008-09)
117\. The grounds of appeal read as under:-
> "1\. That there is no international transaction is contemplated u/s 92CA of
> the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) in respect of the alleged royalty
> chargeable from three Associated Enterprises (AEs) as contemplated u/s 92CA
> of the Act and consequently the order of the CIT (Appeals) upholding the
> chargeability of royalty from three AEs, as alleged by TPO, is arbitrary,
> unjust and bad in law.
2\. That in the absence of any contract as existing during the year between
the assessee and three AEs, neither any royalty accrued during the year nor
can it be presumed to be receivable and consequently the order of the  116 ITA
Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 TPO and sustained by the CIT (Appeals)
are without any basis/material and are based on surmises and conjectures not
permissible under the law.
3\. That the TPO and CIT (Appeals) failed to consider the geographical
conditions of working of Dabur International Ltd., Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and
Asian Consumer Care Ltd., having no substantial awareness about the Dabur
brand in the area and consequently the presumption and assumption about the
chargeability of royalty by invoking the provision of Section 92CA of the Act
from Dabur International Ltd., Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and Asian Consumer Care
Ltd. is arbitrary, unjust and without any basis.
4\. That the CIT (Appeals) and TPO have failed to consider that in the absence
of any expenditure incurred by the assessee for the establishment of brand in
the geographical area of working of Dabur International Ltd., Dabur Nepal Pvt.
Ltd. and Asian Consumer Care Ltd., no royalty can be said to have accrued to
the assessee when Dabur International Ltd., Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and Asian
Consumer Care Ltd. have incurred expenses on advertisement and sale promotion
in their respective area for promotion of the brand which amounts to the
services provided by the AEs to the asses see for completing the brand and
consequently the addition as made by the TPO and sustained by the CIT
(Appeals) in respect of the alleged royalty chargeable from Dabur
International Ltd., Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. and Asian Consumer Care Ltd. is
arbitrary, unjust and at any rate very excessive.
5\. That the TPO and CIT (Appeals) failed to appreciate the relevant clause of
the agreement as existed in earlier years wherein as per the agreement, Dabur
India Ltd. failed to incur the expenses for the promotion of the brand and
marketing expenses in Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., which ultimately and actually
were incurred by Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd., which resulted into termination of the
royalty chargeable under the then contract and consequently the CIT (Appeals)
has erred on facts and under the law in upholding the chargeability of the
royalty from Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd.
6\. That the TPO and CIT (Appeals) failed to consider that most of the
manufactured products by Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. had been sold to Dabur India
Ltd. which cannot be the basis for charging royalty having no connection with
the brand used by Dabur Nepal Pvt. Ltd. in Nepal.
7\. That in the absence of any loan availed by Dabur Egypt on the basis of
corporate guarantee, the CIT (Appeals) has erred in sustaining the alleged
service fee in the form of corporate guarantee from Dabur Egypt @ 0.50% in
respect of loan from HSBC and NSGB Bank is arbitrary, unjust, without any
basis and at any rate very excessive.
8\. That the CIT (Appeals) has erred in sustaining the alleged service fee on
account of the corporate guarantee in the case of Naturelle LLC on the  117
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 loans availed from Royal Bank of
Scotland, in the absence of any benefit accrued to Naterelle LLC, is
arbitrary, unjust, without any basis and at any rate very excessive.
9\. That the above grounds of appeal are independent and without prejudice to
one another.
Your appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend or withdraw any of the
grounds of appeal at the time of hearing."
118\. Ground of appeal Nos.1 to 6 by the assessee and Ground No.2 by the
Revenue relate to the part relief granted by the CIT(A) on account of royalty
received.
119\. After hearing both the sides, we find the above grounds are identical to
grounds of appeal No. 4 to 7 in assessee's appeal and grounds of appeal No. 4
and 5 in Revenue's appeal for A.Y. 2007-08 vide ITA No.3241/Del2014 and ITA
No.3114/Del/2014. We have already decided the issue and the grounds raised by
the assessee have been partly allowed and the grounds of the Revenue have been
dismissed. Following similar reasonings, the grounds raised by the Revenue are
dismissed and the grounds raised by the assessee are partly allowed.
120\. Grounds of appeal No.7 and 8 of the appeal filed by the assessee relate
to the order of the CIT(A) in sustaining addition to the extent of 0.05% as
service fee for the corporate guarantee to Dabur Energy and addition to the
extent of 0.513% as service fee for the corporate guarantee to Naturelle LLC,
UAE.  118
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
121\. After hearing both the sides, we find the assessee during the impugned
assessment year had issued the following corporate guarantees on behalf of its
associated enterprises:
In favour of Finance Amount of Name of Interest rate for availing facility
Guarantee the Bank loan obtained provided (in crores) Dabur Egypt Rs. 15.46

                                                 (24.03.2008 to 31.03.2008)
    Total                  Rs.28.52              '
                           crores                '
122\. It was contended in the TP report that the transaction being in the
nature of shareholder activity, could not be considered as an international
transaction in terms of section 92B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and,
accordingly no benchmarking was undertaken. However, the TPO rejected the
contention of the assessee and computed guarantee fee at the rate of 4.68% on
the basis of data obtained from State Bank of India u/s 133(6) of the Act and
calculated as under:-
    Particulars                        Rate (in %)
    Average rate of bank rate of       2.68
    commission charged
                                       2

                                                             ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
123\. He accordingly, made an upward adjustment of Rs.1,12,23,576 (4% of
Rs.39.44 crores) to the total income of the assessee.
124\. In appeal, the CIT(A) held that issuance of corporate guarantee is an
international transaction and arm's length price (ALP) is required to be
computed under section 92 of the Act. So far as the action of the TPO in
computing the guarantee/service fees @ 4.68%, in respect of guarantee issued
on behalf of Dabur Egypt Ltd, Egypt is concerned, the C1T(A), following his
order for assessment year 2007-08, determined the service fee on account of
corporate guarantee at 0.50% as against 4.68% adopted by the TPO and deleted
the balance amount. So far as the guarantee issued on behalf of Naturalle LLC,
UAE, he concluded that the interest savings on account of corporate guarantee
were 1.025%, out of which 50% (i.e. 0.513%) was attributed towards service fee
and, accordingly, he determined such service fee on account on corporate
guarantee at 0.513% as against 4.68% adopted by the TPO.
125.Aggrieved with such part relief granted by CIT(A), the assessee is in
appeal before the Tribunal.
126.We have heard the rival arguments and perused the record. So far as the
guarantee issued on behalf of Dabur Egypt Ltd., Egypt is concerned, we have
already dealt with this issue while deciding ground of appeal No. 2and 3 for
A.Y. 2007-08 and the same has been determined at 0.30%. Following similar
reasonings, we modify the order of the CIT(A) and direct the AO to adopt the
120 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 service fee on account of
corporate guarantee at 0.30% in respect of guarantee issued on behalf of Dabur
Egypt Ltd., Egypt.
127\. So far as the corporate guarantee issued on behalf of Naturalle LLC, UAE
is concerned, a perusal of the details furnished by the assessee in the paper
book shows that the assessee has saved incremental interest of 1.025% due to
guarantee provided by the assessee which was only with effect from September,
2007. Therefore, we find merit in the argument of the ld. Counsel that the
proportionate interest saved by the Naturalle, LLC was only for a period of 7
months and accordingly, interest saving on only 0.60% was made by Naturalle,
LLC. We have held in the preceding years that interest benefit be split
between the guarantor and borrower on 50:50 basis. Therefore, applying the
said rule, the benefit can be attributed to the service fee on account of
guarantee at 0.30%. We accordingly modify the order of the CIT(A) and direct
the AO to restrict the service fee/commission for providing such corporate
guarantee at 0.30% on the amount of Rs.13.06 crores provided to Naturalle LLC,
UAE. The grounds of appeal Nos.7 and 8 filed by the assessee are accordingly
partly allowed.
128\. Ground of appeal No.1 filed by the Revenue relates to the order of the
CIT(A) in deleting the addition of Rs.2,80,55,365/- made by the AO on account
of interest on loan to the associated enterprise.
121
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
129\. After hearing both the sides, we find the above ground is identical to
ground of appeal No.3 in ITA No.3114/Del/2014 filed by the Revenue for A.Y.
2007-08. We have already decided the issue and the ground raised by the
Revenue has been dismissed. Following similar reasonings, this ground filed by
the Revenue is dismissed.
130\. Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue relates to the order of the CIT(A) in
directing the AO to recompute the deduction u/s 80IB and 80IC without further
allocation the Head Office expenses to various units eligible for such
deduction.
131\. After hearing both the sides, we find the assessee in the instant case
has already disallowed depreciation under Companies Act and has claimed
depreciation under Income-tax Act and has duly allocated to various units.
Similarly, selling and distribution expenses of Rs.789.37 lakhs was suo moto
disallowed in the computation of income, the sales tax expenses of Rs.135.78
lakhs which does not have any impact on profit cannot be allocated to the
eligible units. The miscellaneous expenses of Rs.566.79 lakhs was suo motu
disallowed in the computation of income. We find, the above ground is
identical to ground of appeal No.6 in ITA No.3114/Del/2014 filed by the
Revenue. We have already decided the issue and the ground raised by the
Revenue has been dismissed. Following similar reasonings, this ground filed by
the Revenue is dismissed.
132\. Ground of appeal No.4 by the Revenue relates to the disallowance made
u/s 14A r.w. Rule 8D of the IT Rules, 1962.
122
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
133\. After hearing both the sides, we find, the assessee has not received any
exempt income during the impugned assessment year and, therefore, following
the decisions of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Cheminvest Ltd.
vs. CIT reported in 272 CTR 282, no disallowance u/s 14A can be made.
Therefore, in absence of any exempt income earned by the assessee for the
impugned assessment year no disallowance u/s 14A could have been made. The
ground raised by the Revenue is, therefore, dismissed.
134\. The first additional ground raised by the assessee reads as under:-
> "That the ESOP expenses of Rs.8,45,34,851/- (Rupees eight crore forty five
> lakhs thirty four thousand eight hundred fifty one only) debited in the
> Profit & Loss Account ought to have been allowed as deduction in computing
> the income under the head ''Profit and Gains of Business."
135\. After hearing both the sides, we find identical additional ground was
decided by us in the preceding paragraphs while deciding the appeal of the
assessee for A.Y. 2007-08. We have already admitted the same and the issue has
been restored to the file of the AO with a direction to decide the issue in
accordance with the law, after giving due opportunity of being heard to the
assessee. Following similar reasonings, the first additional ground raised by
the assessee is admitted and restored to the file of the AO to decide the
issue as per law after giving due opportunity of being heard to the assessee.
The first additional ground raised by the assessee is accordingly allowed for
statistical purposes.
136\. The second additional ground raised by the assessee reads as under:-
123
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "That the amount of
> Rs.5,85,61,165/- (Rupees Five Crore Eighty Five Lakhs Sixty One Thousand One
> Hundred Sixty Five only) being the exempted excise duty embedded in sales of
> Glucose Unit, Baddi (HP), allowed incentive for industrialization and
> setting up of new unit by Notification No. 1(10)/2001 - NER dated 701/2003,
> read with Notification No. 49/2003 and Notification No. 50 of 2003 of
> Central Excise dated 10/06/2003, is a capital receipt not liable to Tax and
> accordingly the amount of Rs.5,85,61,165/- (Rupees (Rupees Five Crore Eighty
> Five Lakhs Sixty One Thousand One Hundred Sixty Five only) be excluded from
> the income assessed. "
137\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee while explaining the reasons for
admission of the additional ground in his application submitted that the
assessee has a manufacturing unit located at Baddi, Himachal Pradesh which was
set up in 2003 (25.01.2003) for the manufacture of Glucose which was eligible
for deduction u/s 80IC of the Act. Since assessment year 2003-04, all the
related particulars were duly furnished before the AO. The manufacturing unit
was set up under the Policy of the Central Government to boost
industrialization of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The said scheme was
introduced vide notification F. No. 1(10)/2001- NER, dated 7th January 2003,
which provided for various fiscal incentives in the form of 'tax and central
excise concessions' to attract investments in Himachal Pradesh where the
impugned industrial unit is situated. The ld. Counsel drew the attention of
the Bench to the relevant extracts of various notifications issued by the
Government agencies which are as follows:-
> "No. 1(10)/2001-NER Government of India Ministry of Commerce & Industry
> (Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion) NewDelhi, dated 7th January,
> 2003 OFFICE MEMORANDUM  124 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
> Subject: New Industrial Policy and other concessions for the state of
> Uttaranchal and the state of Himachal Pradesh.
The Hon 'ble Prime Minister, during the visit to Uttranchal from 29th to 31st
March, 2002, had, inter-alia made an announcement that 'Tax and Central Excise
concessions to attract investments in the industrial sector will be worked out
for the Special Category States including Uttranchal. The industries eligible
for such incentives will be environment friendly with potential for local
employment generation and use of local resources.
2\. In pursuance of the above announcement, discussion on Strategy and Action
Plan for Development of Industries and generation of employment in the states
of Uttranchal and Himachal Pradesh were held with the various related
Ministries/agencies on the issue, inter-alia, infrastructure, development,
financial concessions and to provide easy market access. The new initiatives
would provide the required incentives as well as an enabling environment for
industrial development, improve availability of capital and increase market
access to provide a fillip to the private investment in the state.
3\. Accordingly, it has been decided to provide the following package of
incentives for the states of Uttranchal and Himachal Pradesh. 3.1 Fiscal

138\. In pursuance of the said scheme, notification was also passed by the
Central Excise Authorities vide notification No. 49/2003, dated 10th June
2003, the relevant extract of which is as under:
> "In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 5 A of

139\. Further, Notification No. 50/2003, dated 10th June 2003, was passed by
the Central Excise Authorities, which reads as under:
> "Notification No. 50/2003 - Central Excise  126 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
> 6256/Del/2014 G.S.R (E) .- In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-

140\. On the basis of aforesaid scheme and submission of the claim, the
assessee has been granted exemption from payment of excise duty in respect of
goods manufactured and cleared from the Glucose Unit, Baddi for a period of 10
years, beginning from the date of commencement of commercial production.
141\. For accounting, the assessee maintained consistent sales policy in
respect of the eligible and non-eligible units and the value of excise duty
and value added tax  127 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 is always
imbibed/ embedded/ included in the sale value. However, the Excise Duty in
respect of non-eligible unit is deposited with the Excise authorities. In the
return of income for the assessment year 2008-09, the excise duty relating to
the products cleared from Baddi unit has been offered to tax forming part of
taxable income. He submitted that such excise duty exemption available to
Baddi unit under the scheme is in the nature of fiscal incentive provided for
to attract investment for the purpose of industrialization of Himachal Pradesh
which was a backward industrial state. He submitted that the taxability of
incentive provided to boost industrialization in various states by the Central
Government/State Government is no more res integra and the courts are
consistently holding that such fiscal incentive/subsidy are basically capital
in nature not liable to tax. He submitted that in order to work out the nature
of fiscal incentive it has been held by various courts that it has to be
determined with reference to the purpose for which such incentive has been
provided. If the incentive has been provided to assist the operation of
business, then, it is revenue, but, if the benefits have been provided for
industrialization and setting up of new industry, then, it is capital in
nature. In other words, the character of fiscal incentive subsidy has to be
determined having regard to the purpose for which subsidy was given. For the
above proposition, the ld. Counsel relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Ponni Sugar and Chemicals Limited: 306
ITR 392, Sahney Steel and Press Works vs. CIT: 228 ITR 253; and V.S.S.V.
Meenakshi Achi: 60 ITR 253 and various other decisions.
128
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
142\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that in the case of Ponni
Sugar and Chemicals Ltd. the Hon'ble Supreme Court, after following the
purpose test as explained in Sahney Steel (supra) held that the point of time
at which subsidy is paid is not relevant. The source and form of subsidy is
also material. If the object of incentive is to set up a new unit or extend
the existing unit, then, it would be on capital account. Referring to the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ponni Sugar & Chemicals
Ltd. (supra) he drew the attention of the Bench to the following observation
of the Hon'ble Apex Court:-
> "14\. In our view, the controversy in hand can be resolved if we apply the
> test laid down in the judgment of this Court in the case of Sahney Steel and
> Press Works Ltd. (supra). In that case, on behalf of the assessee, it was
> contended that the subsidy given was up to 10% of the capital investment
> calculated on the basis of the quantum of investment in capital and,
> therefore, receipt of such subsidy was on capital account and not on revenue
> account. It was also urged in that case that subsidy granted on the basis of
> refund of sales tax on raw materials, machinery and finished goods were also
> of capital nature as the object of granting refund of sales tax was that the
> assessee could set up new business or expand his existing business. The
> contention of the assessee in that case was dismissed by the Tribunal and,
> therefore, the assessee had come to this Court by way of a special leave
> petition. It was held by this Court on the facts of that case and on the
> basis of the analyses of the Scheme therein that the subsidy given was on
> revenue account because it was given by way of assistance in carrying on of
> trade or business. On the facts of that case, it was held that the subsidy
> given was to meet recurring expenses. It was not for acquiring the capital
> asset. It was not to meet part of the cost. It was not granted for
> production of or brining into existence any new asset. The subsidies in that
> case were granted year after year only after setting up of the new industry
> and only after commencement of production and, therefore, such a subsidy
> could only be treated as assistance given for the purpose of carrying on the
> business of the assessee. Consequently, the contentions raised on behalf of
> the assessee on the facts of that case stood rejected and it was held that
> the subsidy received by Sahney Steel could not be regarded as anything but a
> revenue receipt. Accordingly the matter was decided against the assessee.
> The importance of the judgment of this Court in Sahney Steel case lies in
> the fact that it has discussed and analysed the entire case law and it has
> laid down the basic test to be applied in judging the character of a
> subsidy. That test is that  129 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 the
> character of the receipt in the hands of the assessee has to be determined
> with respect to the purpose for which the subsidy is given. In other words.
> in such cases, one has to apply the purpose test. The point of time at which
> the subsidy is paid is not relevant. The source is immaterial. The form of
> subsidy is immaterial. The main eligibility condition in the scheme with
> which we are concerned in this case is that the incentive must be utilized
> for repayment of loans taken by the assessee to set up new units or for
> substantial expansion of existing units. On this aspect there is no dispute.
> If the object of the subsidy scheme was to enable the assessee to run the
> business more profitably then the receipt is on revenue account. On the
> other hand, if the object of the assistance under the subsidy scheme was to
> enable the assessee to set up a new unit or to expand the existing unit then
> the receipt of the subsidy was on capital account. Therefore, it is the
> object for which the subsidy/assistance is given which determines the nature
> of the incentive subsidy. The form of the mechanism through which the
> subsidy is given is irrelevant. "
143\. He submitted that similar principle has been reiterated by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Chaphalkar Brothers: 351 ITR 309 (Bom).
In that case, the subsidy scheme of the State Government provided for an
exemption of entertainment duty in Multiplex Theatre Complexes newly set up,
for a period of three years, and thereafter payment of entertainment duty at
the rate of 25 per cent for the subsequent two years. In the assessment order
it was found that the aforesaid scheme was really to support the on-going
activities of the multiplex and not for its construction. The Assessing
Officer held that since the scheme took the form of a change in the gross
value of the ticket and contributed towards the day- to-day running expenses,
it was in the nature of a revenue receipt. The ld. CIT(A) dismissed the
appeal. On further appeal, the Tribunal decided the ground in favour of the
assessee holding that the receipt was in the nature of a capital receipt being
an incentive to supplement the construction expenditure of new set up of
Multiplexes hence in the nature of capital receipt. On further appeal, the
Hon'ble  130 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 High Court, applying the
purpose test, held that entertainment tax subsidy was in the nature of capital
receipt not liable to tax.
144\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee also drew the attention to the decision
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. Bougainvillea Multiplex
Entertainment Centre (P.) Ltd.: 373 ITR 14, wherein the assessee was engaged
in the business of running of multiplex cinema halls and shopping malls. It
had been the beneficiary of a scheme promulgated by the State Government
wherein it had been granted exemption from entertainment tax payment. It
claimed deduction to the extent of entertainment tax collected in the
corresponding financial years terming the amounts as capital receipts. The
Assessing Officer disallowed the said claims. On appeal, the Commissioner
(Appeals) as well as the Tribunal allowed the deduction claimed by the
assessee. On further appeal preferred by the Revenue, the Hon'ble High Court
held that exemption from payment of entertainment tax to a multiplex under the
UP Scheme was held to be a capital receipt. He drew the attention of the Bench
to the following observations of the Hon'ble Court:-
> "34\. Seen in the above light, we are of the considered view that it was
> unreasonable on the part of the Assessing Officer to decline the claim of
> the assessee about the subsidy being capital receipt. Such a subsidy by its
> very nature, was bound to come in the hands of the assessee after the cinema
> hall had become functional and definitely not before the commencement of
> production. Since the purpose was to offset the expenditure incurred in
> setting up of the project, such receipt (subject, of course, to the cap of
> amount and period under the scheme) could not have been treated as
> assistance for the purposes of trade.
> 35\. The facts that the subsidy granted through deemed deposit of
> entertainment tax collected does not require it to be linked to any
> particular fixed asset or that is accorded "year after year" do not make any
> difference. The scheme makes it  131 ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 &
> 6256/Del/2014 clear that the grant would stand exhausted the moment
> entertainment tax has been collected (and retained) by the multiplex owner
> meeting the entire cost of construction (apparatus, interiors etc.
> included), even if it were "before completion of five years "
> 36\. As held by the Supreme Court in the case of Sahney Steel & Press Works
> Ltd. (supra), the character of the subsidy is to be determined having regard
> to the purpose for which it is granted. The "purpose test", referred to in
> Ponni Sugars & Chemicals Ltd. (supra) when applied to the case at hand,
> leaves no room for doubt that the assistance in the form of entertainment
> tax exemption is shown to have come in the hands of assessee to enable it to
> set up the new unit which renders it a receipt on capital account. The
> periodicity (year to year) of the subsidy, its source (collections from the
> public at large) and the form (deemed deposit) are irrelevant
> considerations.
> ....................
> 39\. For the foregoing reasons, we find that ITAT in the impugned orders has
> taken a correct view of law on the basis of available facts to conclude that
> the assessee is entitled, in terms of the UP Scheme, to treat the amounts
> collected towards entertainment tax as capital. The question of law raised
> in these appeals is, thus, answered in the negative against the
> revenue/appellant. "
145\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, submitted that the 2nd additional
ground deserves to be admitted in order to correctly assess the tax liability
of the assessee in accordance with the provisions of law.
146\. Referring to the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee
submitted that additional ground of appeal relating to a legal plea can be
raised at any stage:-
          i)      K.C. Khazanchi v. IT AT: C.W. No. 2164/99 (Del. HC);

                                                           ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
146\. Referring to the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee
submitted that there is no bar/ prohibition on the jurisdiction of an
authority to consider fresh claim(s) made by the assessee:-
> i) Jute Corporation of India Limited vs. CIT: 187 ITR 688 (SC);
> ii) CIT v. Jai Parabolic Springs Ltd.: 306 ITR 42 (Del.);
> iii) CIT v. Sam Global Securities Ltd: 360 ITR 682 (Del);

             v)     CIT v. Pruthvi Brokers and Shareholders (P) Ltd.: 208 Taxman
                    498(Bom)/349 ITR 336:
             vi)    CIT v Arvind Mills LTD: ITA No. 1407 of 2011 (Guj);

             xi)    Advik Hi tech (P.) Ltd v. AC1T: 67 SOT 158 (Pune).
> 147\. Referring to the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee
> submitted that where income is wrongly offered by an assessee or on
> previously asserted legal stand, it would not operate as estoppel against
> the assessee to revise such stand and make a legitimate claim otherwise
> entitled in law (No estoppel in law):-
> i) CIT v. Shelly Products: 261 ITR 367 (SC);  133
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014

> IAC: 30 ITD 161 (Delhi SB); and xvii) ITO v. GE Hawn : 2l ITD 553 (All.)
> 148\. Referring to the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee
> submitted that additional ground on issue of subsidy was raised for the
> first time before the Tribunal in the following cases and were admitted:-
i) Shree Balaji Alloys vs. ITO: 127 T'TJ 129 (Asr ITAT) - Confirmed by Supreme
Court in Civil Appeal No. 10061 of 2011;
134
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014
ii) Indo Java & Co. vs. IAC: 30 ITID 161 (Del ITAT)(SB);
iii) Crystal Crop Protection Pvt Ltd. vs. DCIT : ITA No. 1539 of 20l6 (Del
ITAT);
iv) Tripti Manthol Inds vs. ITO: ITA No, 58 of 2011 (Asr ITAT).
149\. He submitted that the appeal against the decision of J&K High Court in
the case of Shree Balaji Alloys vs. CIT, 333 ITR 355 has been dismissed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the order dated 19th April, 2016 in Civil Appeal
No.10061 of 2011.
150\. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
NTPC vs. CIT, 229 ITR 383, he submitted that the Tribunal has wide powers to
admit an additional ground which is necessary to determine the tax liability
of an assessee in accordance with law if the related facts are already on
record. Referring to the following decisions, he submitted that this ground is
purely a legal ground placed on the following decisions:-
i) Biocon Ltd. Vs DCIT reported at 155 TTJ 649 (Bang. SB)
ii) Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd. Vs Addl. CIT in ITA No. 4588/Del/2013 order dated
23.06.2014 (Del. ITAT)
iii) CIT Vs Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd. in ITA No. 107/2015 order dated 18.08.2015
(Del. H.C.)
iv) CIT Vs PVP Ventures Ltd. 90 DTR 340 (Mad.)
151\. He accordingly submitted that since the second additional ground is
purely legal in nature and all facts are available on record or in public
domain, which are government notifications, therefore, the additional ground
should be admitted.  135
ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 Referring to the decision of the
Tribunal in assessee's own case for the immediately preceding assessment year,
he submitted that the additional ground in respect of ESOP was raised by the
assessee before the Tribunal for the first time and the Tribunal after
considering the arguments made by both the sides, has admitted the said
additional ground and restored the issue to the file of the AO/TPO to decide
the issue in accordance with the law, after providing due opportunity of being
heard to the assessee.
151.1 The ld. DR, on the other hand, strongly objected to the admission of the
additional ground. He submitted that this ground should not be admitted at all
as it is for the first time the assessee has come up before the Tribunal with
a new plea.
152\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We
find, the assessee in the instant case, has raised the second additional
ground before the Tribunal relating to treatment of Rs.5,85,61,165/- being the
exempted excise duty to be excluded from the income assessed on the ground
that same being a capital is not liable to tax and be excluded from the income
assessed.
153\. The issue in our opinion, is legal in nature. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of NTPC Ltd. vs. CIT reported in 229 ITR 383 has held as under:-
136
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "The power of the Tribunal in
> dealing with appeals is thus expressed in the widest possible terms. The
> purpose of the assessment proceedings before the taxing authorities is to
> assessee correctly the tax liability of an assessee in accordance with law.
> If, for example, as a result of a judicial decision given while the appeal
> is pending before the Tribunal, it is found that a non-taxable item is taxed
> or a permissible deduction is denied, there is no reason why the assessee
> should be prevented from raising that question before the Tribunal for the
> first time, so long as the relevant facts are on record in respect of the
> item. There is no reason to restrict the power of the Tribunal under section
> 254 only to decide the grounds which arise from the order of the Commission
> of Income-tax (Appeals). Both the assessee as well as the Department have a
> right to file an appeal/cross-objections before the Tribunal. The Tribunal
> should not be prevented from considering questions of law arising in
> assessment proceedings, although not raised earlier. The view that the
> Tribunal is confined only to issues arising out of the appeal before the
> Commissioner (Appeals) is too narrow a view to take of the powers of the
> Tribunal."
153.1 It has further been held that:
> "Undoubtedly, the Tribunal has the discretion to allow or not to allow a new
> ground to be raised. But where the Tribunal is only required to consider the
> question of law arising from facts which are on record in the assessment
> proceedings, there is no reason why such a question should not be allowed to
> be raised when it is necessary to consider that question in order to
> correctly assess the tax liability of an assessee."
154\. We find, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. Jai
Parabolic Springs Ltd. (supra), while adjudicating the claim of deduction of
entire deferred revenue expenses raised as additional ground has held as
under:-
> "19\. In view of the above discussion, it is very clear that there is no
> prohibition on the powers of the Tribunal to entertain an additional ground
> which according to the Tribunal arises in the matter and for the just
> decision of the case. Therefore, there is no infirmity in the order of the
> Tribunal."
155\. We find, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Pruthvi
Brokers & Shareholders (P) Ltd. (supra), while adjudicating the powers of
appellate authorities to consider a claim not made in the return has held as
under:-  137
> ITA Nos.3241, 3114, 6525 & 6256/Del/2014 "29\. It is clear to us that the
> Supreme Court did not hold anything contrary to what was held in the
> previous judgments to the effect that even if a claim is not made before the
> assessing officer, it can be made before the appellate authorities. The
> jurisdiction of the appellate authorities to entertain such a claim has not
> been negated by the Supreme Court in this judgment. In fact, the Supreme
> Court made it clear that the issue in the case was limited to the power of
> the assessing authority and that the judgment does not impinge on the power
> of the Tribunal under section 254.
> 30\. A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dealt with a similar
> submission in Commissioner of Income‐tax v. Jai Parabolic Springs Limited,
> (2008) 306 ITR 42. The Division Bench, in paragraph 17 of the judgment held
> that the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal making it clear that the
> decision was limited to the power of the assessing authority to entertain a
> claim for deduction otherwise than by a revised return and did not impinge
> on the powers of the Tribunal. In paragraph 19, the Division Bench held that
> there was no prohibition on the powers of the Tribunal to entertain an
> additional ground which, according to the Tribunal, arises in the matter and
> for the just decision of the case.
> 31\. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to decide the other questions
> raised by Mr. Mistri.
> 32\. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed."
156\. In view of the above discussion and keeping in mind the ratio laid down
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of NTPC Ltd. (supra), the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of Jai Parabolic Springs Ltd. (supra) the
decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Pruthvi Brokers and
Shareholders (P) Ltd. (supra) and various other decisions relied on by the ld.
Counsel for the assessee, we admit the additional ground raised by the
assessee. However, it is an admitted fact that this issue has been raised by
the assessee for the first time before the Tribunal and the authorities below
had no occasion to deal with this issue. We, therefore, deem it proper to
remand this issue to the file of the AO/TPO to decide this issue in accordance
with law after providing due and reasonable opportunity of  138 ITA Nos.3241,
