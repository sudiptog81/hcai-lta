                    CENTRAL INFORMATION COMMISSION
                    Appeal Nos. CIC/WB/A/2007/001610 dated 11 -12-2007
                        Right to Information Act 2005 - Section 19
    Appellant:     Shri R.K. Arya
    Respondent: Deputy Commissioners Police (DCP), Economic Offences Wing
    (EOW).
    Facts
We have two Appeals in file Nos. CIC/WB/A/2007/001547 and CIC/WB/A/2007/001610
that are identical except in that the information sought is with regard to two
different Police Officers: Inspector Shri R.K. Gulia in File No.
CIC/WB/A/2007/001547 and Sub Inspector Shri Suresh Lakra in File No.
CIC/WB/A/2007/001610. The information sought in both the cases is as follows,
with the name of Sub Inspector Shri Suresh Lakra replacing that of Inspector
Gulia in the application concerning SI Lakra.
1\. "Please tell the residential address of Shri Suresh Lakra, Sub-Inspector
(EOW) Crime, Delhi Police having office at Qutub Institutional Area, Mehrauli,
New Delhi.
2\. Please supply the copy of Income Tax return filed by Shri Suresh Lakra,
reiterate what we has stated in the case of "R.K. Arya Vs. DCP, EOW" file No.
CIC/WB/A/2007/1547 in which we have held as follows:
> "A conscious decision of this nature will have to be taken with regard to
> each such official failing which this exemption cannot be claimed in a
> general manner."
A conscious decision of this nature will have to be taken at least by the Head
of Department and not by the official himself. As held by us in the earlier
case cited above the official residential address is an integral part of the
disclosure mandated for every public authority u/s 4 (1) (b) (ix). In view of
this the appeal is allowed. The information asked will be provided to the
appellant Shri Arya by the CPIO within 10 working days of the date of issue of
this decision notice.
Reserved in the hearing, this Decision is announced in open chamber on this
18th day of June, 2009. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the
parties.

2\. Please supply the copy of Income Tax return filed by Shri Suresh Lakra,
Sub-Inspector, to Income Tax Department and to you for the years 2002 to 2006.
3\. Please give the details of properties, which have been furnished by Shri
Suresh Lakra, Sub-Inspector (EOW) Crime, Delhi Police at the time to join the
service for the year 2005 and 2006.
4\. Please tell what is gross salary and carrying home salary of Shri Suresh
Lakra, Sub-Inspector (EOW) Crime, Delhi Police.
In both cases an identical response was received dated 2.4.2007 refusing the
information/documents, sought u/s 8 (1) (j) of the Right to Information Act,
2005. In both cases appeals were moved on 20.4.2007 and an identical decision
dated 15.5.2007 given by Shri Ranjit Narayan, JCP (Crime) as follows:
> "Having carefully gone through the contents of appeal and material available
> on record, it is found that the appellant has sought personal information
> mentioned above in respect of Inspr. R. K. Gulia, which has no relationship
> to any public activity or interest. Undoubtedly, disclosure of this personal
> information would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the  1
> individual. The exemption of information u/s 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act, 2005,
> has, therefore, been correctly applied by the PIO. The decision of PIO is
> upheld."
Appellant's prayer before us is also identical in both cases and reads as
follows:
> "Relief sought against the act and conduct/ gross negligence of the said PIO
> and the First Appellate Authority under Right to Information Act, 2005."
In both cases penalty has been sought against the CPIO and Appellate
Authority. Four appeals were heard together on 13-4-2009. The following were
present.
Appellants Shri Rajender Kumar Arya Shri Ramesh Kumar Respondents Shri K.K.
Vyas, DCP Shri Ramesh Chander, Inspector Shri M.K. Mishra, S.I.
Shri Ganga Sahai Meena, ACP/HQ/E In the two cases mentioned in Para 1 DCP Shri
K.K. Vyas clarified that the officers concerned are no longer with EOW but are
(i) Mr. R.K. Gulia with Crime Branch and (ii) Shri Suresh Lakra with Security.
Although, already explained to DCP at least part of the information sought by
the appellant regarding these officers is fully disclosable suo moto u/s 4 (1)
(b) (ix) and (x) of the RTI Act, but before ordering full disclosure of the
information sought both parties being a third party in these cases we deemed
it necessary that we give them opportunity to be heard. The hearing in both
these cases was, st therefore, adjourned to 1 May 2009 at 11.30 a.m. when
appellant and third parties were directed to appear. The DCP, EOW having made
his points was not required to appear. Accordingly the cases were heard once
more on 15-5- 2009\. The following were present Appellants Shri Rajender Kumar
Arya Shri R. K. Goyal.
Respondent Shri Ram Kanwar Gulia, Inspector.

Shri Lakra appeared for hearing at 12.45 p.m. He submitted that first he had
gone to Old JNU campus as he was not aware as to where he has to report
because he received the message over the telephone a day before and could not
determine where he has to report. He therefore sought opportunity for further
hearing, which was accepted, and accordingly the hearing in File th No.
CIC/WB/A/2007/001610. was adjourned to 12 June, 2009 at 12.30 p.m. when Shri
Suresh Lakra was asked to be present. The appellant was also to appear if he
so wished. The hearing in file No. CIC/WB/A/2007/01610 was held on 12-6-2009,
when the following are present.
Appellant Shri Rajender Kumar Arya.
Shri Ramesh Respondent Shri Suresh Kumar, SI.
Shri Suresh Kumar submitted written arguments stating that he was
Investigating Officer in the case involving Shri R.K. Arya as a result of
which Shri Arya has been stalking him and harassing his family. He has
apprehensions of danger to his family. In this context he has cited the
following from our decision in file No. CIC/WB/A/2007/1547:
> "That the CIC further held, 'that their can be an exception to this rule if
> the position held by the official concerned or the work he/ she is engaged
> is of so sensitive a nature that any such disclosure could lead to
> apprehension to the life of physical safety of the persons in which case it
> will merit exemption from disclosure of information."
On this basis he has gone on to argue that his residential address should not
be disclosed for the following reasons:
> "a) The appellant Shri Rajendra Kumar Arya was rightly involved in case FIR
> No. 140/2006 dated 5.4.2006 u/s 63/65 C.R. Act and 420/120B, P. S. Krishna
> Nagar on the basis of the raid conducted on the complaint of Mr. Anurudh
> Kumar Chaubey authorised representative of Hoghton Miffin Co. on 5.4.2006.
> it may be stated that when he has produced before the learned ACMM on
> 6.4.2006, he did not point out any procedural discrepancy or misbehaviour
> caused during course of investigation. He levelled many such allegations in
> an after thought manner there after. On 21.4.2006, the accused (Appellant
> here) did not reveal any grudge what so ever against either the complainant
> or the police. If he  3 (Appellant) would have any, he was free to bring out
> into the notice of the court.
> Further the appellant did not mention any of his complaints in the bail
> petition, which he made later on two different quarters that certain files
> and other articles were stolen from his house by the raiding team and also
> regarding misbehaviour caused to him. Those articles were not allegedly
> mentioned in the seizure memo prepared by the police. Even though the
> complaints of the appellant were taken into consideration by the Hon'ble
> Court, the appellant unceasingly took the issue to different authorities and
> tried to mount pressure on the investigating officers. Further the appellant
> has attempted to pressurize the complainant by sending his men to the
> residence of the complainant for a negotiation in the matter in the night
> intervening 18/19-5-06. The appellant has been trying to hamper the
> investigation by putting pressure on the IO and ACP/IPR by way of throwing
> complaints. The acts of the appellants are really revenge against the police
> and prosecution witness because of the reason he was booked by them. When on
> 5.5.2006, the Hon'ble ASJ ordered the appellant to furnish the sale records
> to the IO he engineered a plan to file a complaint against the raiding party
> so that he may escape the liability of producing the records. The appellant
> devised a way to pressurize the IO by sending a legal notice under different
> sections of law with threatening language though he was caught with
> infringed books. The appellant has been suing his energy to hamper the
> investigation by way of filing false and frivolous complaints against the
> complaints and the investigating agency. The appellant tried to tamper with
> the evidences and win over the witnesses.
> From the above, it is clear that the appellant was having a hostile attitude
> towards the respondent, who was the IO of the case( SI Suresh Lakra) to
> bring any physical and bodily harm including the faculty of the respondents.
> Moreover the respondent was dealing with the case of sensitive nature in
> that the disclosure of the residence of the respondent could lead to
> apprehension of danger to the life of physical safety of the person and all
> the circumstances will merit the exemption from disclosure of information.
b) Ignited by the vengeance reaped up the appellant to cause bodily and
physical harm to the respondent, the appellant filled three complaint cases
bearing No. 21/2007, 26/2007 and 33/2007. In all the aforesaid  4 criminal
cases, the appellant has alleged that the respondent had demanded and accepted
the bribe from the appellant. The bribe money according to appellant ranged
between thousands and lakhs at different occasions. The appellant further
alleged that respondent was having the properties, which were disproportionate
to his known sources of income. In complaint no. 26/07 and 33/07 the appellant
levelled false allegation against Inspector Tej Pal and DCP Mahavir Singh to
save the respondent from the punishment and to register a FIR under different
section of law. All the three complaint cases were dismissed by the learned
Court of Shri S. P. Garg, Special Judge, Tis Hazari Courts Delhi vide
judgement/ Order dated 20.12.2008. All this goes to show that the appellant
wanted to cause bodily harm and injury to the respondent. The learned special
judge has given a number of the grounds in support of his decision while
dismissing the complaints. The respondent is not repeating the grounds of
dismissal of the complaints or the sake of brevity.
c) That it is established that the appellant wants to cause harm in body and
faculties of the respondent by filing false complaints of corruption against
the respondent. It will further be seen that the sanction under section 197
read with section 140 of Delhi Police Act 1978 and u/s 19 of Prevention of
Corruption Act 1988 to lodge the criminal proceedings against the respondents
u/s 381/342/341 etc and u/s 13 (1) of Prevention of Corruption act 1988 was
rejected by the Hon'ble Lt. Governor NCT Delhi vide order
F.7/57/2006/HP-1/ESTT.6199 dated 13.11.2007.
Thus the appellant was out and out intending to cause bodily harm and so the
respondent is apprehending the danger to his life of public safety, thus the
circumstances merit the exemption from disclosure of information."
He concluded with the argument that such disclosure will amount to violation
of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
