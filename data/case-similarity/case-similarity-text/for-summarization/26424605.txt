that sincere efforts have been made to join independent witnesses. In the
present case, it is evident that no such sincere efforts have been made,
particularly when we find that shops were open and one or two shop­keepers
could have been persuaded to join the raiding party to witness the recovery
being made from the appellant. In case any of the shopkeepers had declined to
join the raiding party, the police could have later on taken legal action
against such shopkeepers because they could not have escaped the rigours of
law while declining to perform their legal duty to assist the police in
investigation as a citizen, which is an offence under the IPC''.

BRIEF STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR DECISION:
1\. Briefly stated, accused Shakti has been sent to face trial with the
allegations that on 08.04.06 at 8.15 PM at new PRC container FIR No. 287/06 PS
Badarpur 1 of 7 State vs. Shakti depot, near Ali Mor, within the jurisdiction
of PS Badarpur, accused was found in possession of one buttondar knife without
any licence in contravention of notification issued by Delhi Administration.
Investigation was carried out.
2\. Upon completion of investigation charge sheet U/s 173 Cr.P.C. was filed on
behalf of the IO and the accused person was consequently summoned. A formal
charge U/s 25 Arms Act was framed against the accused to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.
3\. In order to substantiate the allegations, three witnesses have been
examined on behalf of the prosecution.
4\. PW1 is Ct. Sanjay who has deposed that on 08.04.06 while patrolling
alongwith Ct. Surender and at about 8.15 PM they reached near New PRC
Container depot, near Ali More, Badarpur, where accused was seen coming from
railway line side and on seeing them he turned back and started running. He
has further deposed that accused was apprehended on suspicion and from his
search one buttondar knife was recovered. He has further deposed that in the
meantime HC Bansi Ram (IO) came at the spot to whom the accused with case
property was handed over. He has further deposed that IO FIR No. 287/06 PS
Badarpur 2 of 7 State vs. Shakti recorded his statement Ex.PW1/A. He has
further deposed that HC Bansi Ram requested some public persons to join the
investigation but no one agreed and left the spot without disclosing their
names and address. He has further deposed that knife was measured, total
length was 24 Cms, handle was 13 and blade was 11 Cms. He has further deposed
that knife was sealed with the seal of BRG and seal after use was handed over
to Ct. Surender. He duly proved sketch of knife Ex.PW1/B, seizure memo
Ex.PW1/C, Arrest memo Ex.PW1/D and personal search memo as Ex.PW1/E. During
his cross­examination he has denied the suggestion that no knife was recovered
from the possession of accused.
5\. PW2 ASI Ved Vir is the duty officer who recorded the formal FIR. He proved
copy of FIR as Ex.PW 2/A and his endorsement on rukka as Ex.PW2/B.
6\. PW3 is Ct. Surender who has deposed on similar lines as that of PW1.
7\. PE was closed by order of this court on 11.07.12.
Memorandum of statement of accused U/s 281 Cr.P.C was recorded wherein he has
refuted the allegations levelled against him in toto. Accused chose not to
lead any defence evidence in his favour.
    FIR No. 287/06   PS Badarpur                                                    3  of  7
                                                                                        State vs. Shakti 
8\. I have heard the rival submissions and carefully perused the record.
9\. In a criminal trial, the onus remains on the prosecution to prove the
guilt of accused beyond all reasonable doubts and benefit of doubt, if any,
must necessarily go in favour of the accused. It is for the prosecution to
travel the entire distance from may have to must have. If the prosecution
appears to be improbable or lacks credibility the benefit of doubt necessarily
has to go to the accused.
10\. As per the prosecution case, seizure memo of the knife Ex.PW1/C were
prepared before the preparation of the Rukka. However, the said document would
show that it contained the number of the FIR. It shows the serious infirmity
in the case of prosecution as either the number of the FIR was inserted later
on or that they were prepared before the time they have been shown to have
been prepared. Be that as it may the same creates a reasonable doubt in the
story of prosecution. The reliance is placed on the judgment of Giri Raj Vs.
State 83 (2000) DLT 201, Mohd. Hashim, Appellant Vs. State, 2000 CRI.L.J.
1510, Pawan Kumar Vs. Delhi Administration, 1987 CCC 585 and Mewa Ram Vs.
State 2000 CRI.L.J. 114.
11\. As per the case of the prosecution, the seal after use was FIR No. 287/06
PS Badarpur 4 of 7 State vs. Shakti handed over to Ct. Surender and was not
given to any independent public person. In such a scenario tampering with case
property cannot be ruled out. The reliance is placed on the judgment of Ramji
Singh Vs. State of Haryana 2007 (3) R.C.C. (Criminal) 452, Rajesh Jagdamba
Avasthi Vs. State of Goa (2005) 9 SCC 773 and Bijay Vs. State (G.N.C.T. of
Delhi), 2011 VI AD (DELHI) 562.
12\. Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934, provides that the hour
of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police station of all enrolled
police officers of whatever rank, whether posted at the police station or
elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their duty shall be entered vide
a separate entry and this entry shall be made immediately on arrival or prior
to the departure of the officer concerned and shall be attested by the latter
personality by signature or seal. In the present case, no departure or the
arrival entry has been proved on the record by the prosecution. In absence of
the departure and arrival entry of the police officials their presence at the
spot cannot be believed. Reference can be made to on Rattan Lal Vs. State 1987
(2) Crimes 29.
13\. In the present case, as per PW1, request was made to public persons but
none came forward. However, there is nothing on record FIR No. 287/06 PS
Badarpur 5 of 7 State vs. Shakti to suggest whether any written notice was
served upon public persons to join the proceedings in the present case or to
face action U/sec. 187 IPC. Failure on the part of prosecution to make sincere
efforts for joining independent public witnesses in the proceedings when they
are available creates reasonable doubt in the prosecution in view of the
following case laws.
14\. In a case law reported as Anoop Joshi V/s State, 1992 (2) C.C. Cases 314
(HC), Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has observed as under:­ '' It is repeatedly
laid down by this Court that in such cases it should be shown by the police
that sincere efforts have been made to join independent witnesses. In the
present case, it is evident that no such sincere efforts have been made,
particularly when we find that shops were open and one or two shop­keepers
could have been persuaded to join the raiding party to witness the recovery
being made from the appellant. In case any of the shopkeepers had declined to
join the raiding party, the police could have later on taken legal action
against such shopkeepers because they could not have escaped the rigours of
law while declining to perform their legal duty to assist the police in
investigation as a citizen, which is an offence under the IPC''.
15\. Therefore, in view of the discussions made herein above and FIR No.
287/06 PS Badarpur 6 of 7 State vs. Shakti the facts and circumstances of the
present case, in my considered opinion, the prosecution has failed to prove
the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, accused Shakti stands
acquitted of the offence Under Sec. 25 Arms Act. 1959, he has been charged
with. Case property be destroyed after the expiry of the period of appeal.
Ordered accordingly.
