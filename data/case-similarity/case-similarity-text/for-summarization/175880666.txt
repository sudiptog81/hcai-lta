8.1 Search to the premises of the appellant Company made on 25/05/2004 and
similar search to the premises of M/s Park Electronics, 406, 4th Floor, 56,
Nehru Place, New Delhi, New Delhi, a distributor of Samsung, made on 22.5.2004
resulted in recovery of certain documents which were subjected to scrutiny by
investigation. Statements from different persons were recorded in the course
of investigation and extensive enquiry was made to ascertain real nature of
the goods exported to claim DEPB benefit as is apparent from in Para 6 to 11
of the adjudication order.
8.2 Investigation noticed that Colour Monitors, VGA (Video Graphic Array) of
15 and above and Colour Monitors of higher quality/resolutions were exported
by the appellant company during December 2001 to 31.3.2004 mis-declaring the
same as CRT Data Display Monitor (Colour CGA) to make undue gain of DEPB
benefit since DEPB benefit was available only against CRT Data Display Monitor
(Colour CGA) of all sizes but not against Colour Monitors VGA of 15 and
higher sizes at the relevant time. Investigation proceeded to ascertain
whether the appellant company had manufactured CGA monitor to export the same.
But it came to the light that no such monitors were manufactured by the
appellant company.
8.3 Investigation examined Shri Sanjay Pees, National Sales Manager IT
Products of the appellant company. He, in his statement recorded under section
108 of the Customs Act, 1962., inter alia stated that they used to sell their
colour monitors of range 15, 17,19 and 21; and Colour Monitor with base
resolution 1024 X 768 (Minimum) and above (which comes under the category
XGA); they had not sold any CGA color monitor during last two years.
8.4 Shri Ajay Kumar, Proprietor of M/s Park Electronics, a distributor of
Samsung in his statement interalia, stated that he used to buy computer
components/peripherals from national distributors of Samsung; that all models
of color monitors being bought by them from Samsung were VGA technology based;
that they had not procured any CGA monitor since the commencement of their
business i.e. 1993 and CGA monitors were not being sold since long.
8.5 Shri Vivek Prakash, Vice President (marketing) and incharge of I.T.
Products (Sales) as well as integrated marketing group of Samsung, in his
statement dated 22.5.2004, inter alia, stated that he was responsible for
sales of I.T. Products both in India and abroad; they have exported CDT based
monitors of various sizes viz 15 and 17 both normal and flat tube type from
their factory in India; that the exact technical specification are available
on the companys website; that the decision regarding classification of
monitors for the purpose of DEPB was taken by Shri N.K. Singh, logistics team
member and that Shri N. K. Singh does not work for Samsung any more.
Accordingly, data was collected by the investigation form the various web
sites containing the specifications of CGA monitors and VGA monitors and
monitors of higher specifications which revealed that M/s Samsung had exported
VGA technology monitors only and not CGA technology monitors.
8.6 LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. vide their letter No. TSPL/LGEIL/DGFT dated
11.03.2004 written to the DGFT Udyog Bhawan, New Delhi with a copy endorsed to
investigation confirmed that as per their understanding CGA Monitors were not
manufactured in India at all since that was an outdated technology replaced by
VGA.
8.7 Shri Mihir Tiwari, Business Manager, Exports of Samsung admitted in his
statement dated 10.01.05 about the availment of aforesaid amounts of DEPB
credit against export of VGA colour monitors and utilization thereof to
discharge Customs duty against imports made by the appellant company.
8.8 Shri Sunil Goel, Vice President (Finance and Account) of Samsung in his
statement dated 25.06.2004 admitted that their company was exporting Colour
Monitors to various countries under DEPB Scheme. On being asked about the
person instrumental in deciding the classification of Colour Monitors for DEPB
benefit he stated that he did not know as to who was the person who decided
the classification of Colour Monitor for export under DEPB Scheme.
8.9 M/s Samsung India Electronics Ltd. vide their letter dated 10.06.2004
informed that they made deposit of Rs.1,60,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Sixty
Lakhs only) vide TR-6 Challan No. 1184 dated 10.06.2004 towards ineligible
DEPB credit already utilized by them.
8.10 Investigation visited the web site: http:/what is
techtarget.com/definition/o.sid9 gci 211966.html, and noticed technical
features of the goods manufactured and sold by the appellant company as
recorded in Para 12 to 18 of the adjudication order No. 50 dated 29/08/2008.
Goods of appellant company were compared with the nature of the goods
manufacture in India by IBM and it was found that technically CGA and VGA
monitors were different. Different features of both has been depicted in para
12 of the adjudication order No. 50/2008 dated 29/08/2008 for comparison.
Motive of the appellant to make undue gain of DEPB benefit making
misdeclaration of description of goods has been recorded in para 20 of the
above adjudication order.
9.1 From the scrutiny of the documents recovered, statements recorded from the
persons connected with dealing in production/export of Samsung monitors and
technical data gathered from web site it was inferred by investigation that
the appellant company had been mis-declaring its monitors for export as CRT
Data Display Monitors (Colour CGA) to claim DEPB benefit whereas they were
actually manufacturing and exporting VGA and other higher versions of colour
monitors viz. XGA, SXGA etc on which there was no DEPB benefit available to
them.
9.2 Examining statement of Shri Mihir Tiwari, Manager OEM Exports on
25/06/2004, learned Adjudicating Authority below got a fair idea about the
nature and type of goods exported by the appellant as has been recorded in
para 20 of the adjudication order no. 50/2008 dated 29/08/2008. Shri Tiwari
also admitted that the monitors exported by them were of the above model and
size. In para 22 of the said order technical features of goods of the
appellant was compared with other three manufacturers and tabulated for
appreciation of the nature and character of the goods exported. In para 24 of
the impugned order it had been brought out how VGA and XGA monitors have
different characteristics which were exported describing the same in the
shipping bill as CGA monitors to get DEPB benefit unduly.
9.3 Authority below examined statement of production of monitors during
December 2001 to 31.03.2004 as submitted by Shri Vimal Bajpai of Samsung on
22.05.2004. Such statement confirmed the fact of no manufacture of CGA
monitors when evidence gathered by investigation demonstrated that Samsung
manufactured Monitors of Models 45BN 14, 56V 15, 7535 17, 551S 15, 1525
15 753DFX 17 153V, 763 MB.
9.4 Ld. Adjudicating Authority evaluated evidence recorded from Shri Ajay
Anand, Quality Control Manager of Samsung. In his statement, he admittedly
revealed that the resolutions of their 15 and 17 monitors were 1024 X 768
and 1280 X 1024 specification respectively. As per information available in
the internet website: http:what is techtarget.com/definition/o. sidgesei
211966.html the 1024x768 resolution monitors were of XGA and resolution of
1280x1024 was of SXGA-monitors as was admitted by appellant company which
manufactured colour monitors of size 15, 17 and 19.
9.5 Ld. Adjudicating Authority opined that technical specification of the
monitors exhibited by the website of the appellant established that the said
monitors were not CRT Data Display Monitors (Colour CGA) but were colour
monitors of higher resolution i.e. VGA, EXA, SXGA etc. Appellant did not
export CRT Data Display Monitor (Colour CGA) at all. But colour monitor of
higher resolutions i.e. VGA, EXA, SXGA etc were exported. This was established
from admitted fact by Shri Sanjay Pees, National Sales Manager of Samsung who
stated that appellant company never sold any CAG colour monitor during the
last 2 years.
9.6 Ld. Adjudicating Authority also relied on statement of Shri Ajay Kumar,
Prop. of distributor of appellant. He admittedly stated that the monitors
purchased by them from the appellant company were not CGA CRT Data Display
Colour Monitors; that monitors purchased by them since 1993 from Samsung were
VGA and of higher versions/resolutions and that CGA colour monitors were not
manufactured in India since then.
9.7 Shri Vivek Prakash, Vice President Marketing and incharge of IT products
of the appellant, in his statement, stated that the exact technical
specification of the monitor manufactured and exported by tem is given on
their website.
9.8 Ld. Adjudicating Authority found that the aforesaid statement were
credential when unrebutted by appellant company and without leading any cogent
evidence to the contrary. He also found from various websites that monitor of
resolution 1024 x 768 and 1280 x 1024 were of XGA and SXGA respectively and
not of colour CGA which proved that colour monitors exported by Samsung were
not CRT Data Display Monitors (Colour CGA) but were colour monitors VGA or XGA
or SXGA of higher resolutions.
9.9 It was stated by Sri Ajay Anand that Monitors exported by appellant had 13
and 15 pins respectively for different sizes of the monitors. But its web site
showed that CGA Colour monitor had only 9 pins. This proved that the pins used
in the colour monitors manufactured and exported by the appellant company were
not of CRT Data Display Moniotrs (Colour CGA) but were of VGA colour monitors
and of higher resolutions.
9.10 Ld. Adjudicating Authority found statement of Shri Sanjay Pees, Area
Sales Manager of appellant company was credible since he categorically stated
that Samsung had not sold any CGA Colour Monitor (CRT Data Display Monitors)
during the preceding two years. Similarly, statement of Shri Ajay kumar,
Proprietor of M/s Park Electronics who was distributor of appellant was
believable when he stated that he had never purchased any CGA colour monitor
from Samsung. He had also confirmed that the colour monitors of Samsung were
VGA technology based. He categorically stated that CGA colour monitors were
not sold by him. The colour monitors found in stock of M/s Park Electronics
were of models 773S, 773DFX, 763 MB and resolution of the said models of
monitors was not of (CGA colour) CRT Display Monitor but was of VGA Colour.
9.11 Ld. Adjudicating Authority also found that the technical specifications
of monitors of appellant company retrieved from its website established that
the scanning frequency of the monitors of the appellant was 30-70 kHz which
were of VGA colour monitors. Scanning frequency of CGA colour monitors was
only 15.7 kHz as per information available form website
http:/www/monitorworld.com. Accordingly he held that samsung did not export
(Colour CGA) CRT Data Display Monitors but exported Colour Monitors of VGA and
of higher resolutions only.
9.12 Ld. Authority also looked into Sync Master CDT Monitor Sales Guide, of
M/s Samsung which showed Systems Requirements. The Systems Requirements
exhibited VGA-SOOx600-16 bit thousand of colours. So also the signal used in
CGA Colour monitor is digital colour signal. Specifications of colour monitors
of appellant company showed that the signal used in the monitors was RGB
Analog Video Signal which is used in colour monitors of VGA and XGA etc of
higher resolutions and not in CRT Data Display Monitors (colour CGA).
9.13 Further, according to ld. Adjudicating Authority as per endorsed copy of
the letter of DGFT, monitors exported by M/s Samsung were not CRT Data Display
Monitor colour CGA. This established that the CGA monitors were not
manufactured in India during the relevant period and the monitors manufactured
in India during that period was VGA Colour Monitors only.
10\. In Para 28 of adjudication order, breach of law made by the appellant
company and other persons was recorded by ld. Adjudicating Authority to
complete the adjudication examining entire defence of the appellant. He held
that the goods exported by the appellant company as per shipping bills and
invoice were 15 monitor, Sync Master 551S model; 17 monitor, Sync Master
773S and Sync Master 773 DGX and Sync Master 763MB not entitled to DEPB
benefit.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS 11.1 Ld. Counsel for the appellant submitted
that monitors exported during the impugned period had screen sizes of 15,
17 and 19 and CRT Data Display Monitors (Colour CGA) was entitled to be 16%
DEPB benefit. The appellant claimed such benefit under bonafide belief that
CRT Data Display Monitors was not Colour Graphic Adopter, but Computer Graphic
Array or Compatible Graphic Array. In view of the words used colour in bracket
under serial no. 17 of the DEPB schedule the abbreviation CGA shall not be
Colour Graphic Adapter that shall be only Computer Graphic Array or Compatible
Graphic Array since the word color was not intended to be used twice in the
DEPB Schedule under serial number 17. It was further submitted that the
customs authority has no jurisdiction to sit over judgment of DGFT which is
licensing authority as DEPB granting authority. Therefore the authority
implementing Export-Import Policy can only have a say as to whether DEPB
benefit shall be admissible to the appellant. Accordingly appellants argument
was that sow cause notice was issued without jurisdiction relying on the
following judgments:
(i) Ashok Enterprises vs. CC, Chennai-2005 (179) ELT 124 (T).
(ii) Kobian ESC India Pvt. Ltd. vs. CC-2003 (157) ELT 662 (T).
(iii) M.K. Fisheries vs. CC, Cochin-2002 (150) ELT 998 (T)
(iv) Vrundavan Exports vs. CC Mumbai reported in 2005 (191) ELT 1036
(v) Pradeep Polyfils reported in 2004 (173) ELT 3
(vi) ITC Ltd. reported at 171 ELT 733 SC 11.2 It was submitted on behalf of
the appellant that the public notice No.3/2004-09 dated14/09/2004 removed the
controversy of appearance of colour CGA in sl. No. 17 of the DEPB schedule and
after removal of such controversy, the entry reads as under:
Colour Monitors/CRT Display Monitors (Colour) The entry under Sl. No. 17 of
DEPB schedule granting benefit to colour CGA Monitor prior to resolving the
difference was reading as under:
Sl. No. Item DEPB Credit 17 CRT Data Display Monitors (colour CGA) 16% 11.3
It was submitted by the learned Counsel for appellant that subsequent
amendment coming into force from 14/09/2004 having removed the difficulty is
clarificatory in nature and that shall retrospectively apply to the colour CGA
Monitors exported by the appellant and DEPB benefit undeniable.
11.4 According to the appellant, an interpretation which is in accordance with
advancement in technology should be adopted. Similarly, condition of
notification No. 45/2002-Cus dated 14/05/2002 having been fulfilled it was
rightly issued DEPB scrips and use of the scrips for discharge of customs duty
against imports cannot be denied. The appellant bonafide believed that it was
entitled to the DEPB benefit. Therefore denial of benefit of DEPB is
unwarranted. So, also Section 28 cannot be invoked to apply longer period of
limitation for which the adjudication is time barred.
11.5 It was further argued that the penalties imposed on the appellants be
waived and no duty chargeable nor claim to and use of the DEPB scrips
deniable.
11.6 Under Para 4.37 of Hand Book of Procedure prescribes the DEPB rate taking
into the deemed duty paid on the imported inputs for export products, FOB
value of export is determined. Therefore DEPB against such FOB value of export
of cannot be denied. Neither there was short levy nor the shipping bills
challlanged. Therefore no demand arises in adjudication.
11.7 It was alternatively argued that duty drawback is admissible to the
appellant under section 75 of Customs Act, 1962.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF REVENUE 12.1 On the other hand revenue argued that when
the deliberate misdeclaration was detected, the appellant made deposit of part
of the DEPB benefit gained unduly. Investigation and extensive enquiry made
resulted in gathering of vital evidence of no manufacture of CAG colour
monitor by the appellant at the relevant time proving neither sale nor export
thereof made as has been established in adjudication by evidence recorded in
adjudication order. Evidence gathered from the distributor of the appellant
proved such fact and the inventory taken from the distributors premises also
proved the same. No manufacture of CAG monitor by the appellant. Even the
persons in charge of manufacture and sales of the product of the company
revealed that no CAG monitors were manufactured by the appellant.
12.2 The appellant defined the abbreviation CAG according to its own
convenience to serve its ill will with the ulterior motive to make undue gain
at the cost of revenue and draws misplaced sympathy of the Court when its web
site provided all technical details of the product it manufactured as has been
descriptively recorded by learned adjudicating authority. IBM also confirmed
no manufacture of CAG computer at the relevant point of time in India. There
were several evidence gathered by the investigation which was evaluated by the
learned adjudicating authority and appreciated demonstrating that the
appellant had never manufactured nor exported CAG monitors of the description
entitled to DEPB benefit for which adjudication was rightly done. None of the
evidence gathered by the investigation was rebutted by the appellant except a
mere consolation that CAG stands for Computer Graphic Array or Colour Graphic
Array which is not a fact nor revealed to investigation. It is an afterthought
plea to escape adjudication.
12.3 Appellants plea that Customs Authority has no jurisdiction on DEPB issue
is a fallacy since every authority acts within its jurisdiction and Customs
performs its duty to curb evils of misdeclaration to save the exchequer from
loss of Revenue due to undue gain of DEPB scrips. Appellant filed to prove its
bonafide for which it deposited part of DEPB amount unduly gained by it when
its deliberate misdeclaration was detected. Without coming out with clean
hands, the appellant has made futile exercise to make undue gain of the ratio
of the judgments cited by it.
12.4 Ld. Adjudicating Authority had proper authority and jurisdiction to
adjudicate the matter when Revenue was defrauded, invoking extended period of
limitation prescribed by section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 following the
ratio laid down by Apex Court in the case of CC V. Candid Enterprises
2001(130) ELT 404 (SC). He has acted well within his jurisdiction and rightly
examined the credible and cogent evidence gathered by investigation from
different sources including website information by corroborative enquiry.
Therefore adjudication findings are not liable to be disturbed. Appellant made
deliberate misdeclaration of description of goods for which action was rightly
initiated under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962. That disentitles the
appellant to claim DEPB benefit under law when entire plea of appellant is
baseless to get relief in these appeals for no reason. Therefore none of the
adjudication findings are liable to be disturbed and all the appeals are
liable to be dismissed.
FINDING AND ORDER OF TRIBUNAL 13.1 Heard both sides and also perused the
record.
13.2 What that was argued before learned Adjudicating Authority was only
reiterated before Tribunal contending that the abbreviation of CGA stands for
Computer Graphic Array or Compatible Graphic Array but not colour graphic
adopter. Such technical plea was not at all substantiated by any evidence or
any authenticated technical literature produced in the course of hearing for
appreciation. The only stand of the appellant was that sl. No. 17 of DEPB
Schedule enables it to get DEPB scrips for utilization thereof to discharge
import duty.
13.3 Adjudicating Authority examined entire evidence gathered by investigation
from different sources, persons and website as has been enumerated in Para 8.1
to Para 10 of this order establishing that the exported consignments were not
CGA monitors. None of the evidence relied by ld. Adjudicating Authority were
discarded by the appellant leading any cogent evidence. The evidence gathered
from the web site showing number of pins used in the monitor exported went
against the appellant demonstrating neither CGA monitors were manufactured nor
exported by the appellant. This was corroborated from the inventory taken at
the distributors premises and various oral evidence recorded u/s 108 of the
Customs Act, 1962 from technical and marketing personnel of the appellant.
Such evidence remained un-assailed by appellant in the course of hearing these
appeals.
13.4 Entire oral evidence gathered by investigation remained un-rebutted by
the appellant in the course of hearing. Appellants claim that the subsequent
notification dated 14/09/2004 of the DGFT amending the entry 17 of the DEPB
schedule to read the goods as colour monitors/ CRT display monitors (colour)
clarified that the goods exported were CAG monitors does not appeal to common
sense since altogether different goods were exported by appellant by the
technical features thereof as has been established from adjudication finding.
13.5 The notification dt. 14.9.2004 was pressed by appellant to be read as
retrospective to grant benefit to it was at the cost of the exchequer. Its
submission that the said notification shall be read as clarificatory fails to
succeed in absence of any legislative intention thereto. If the notification
is read as suggested by the appellant that shall unjustly enrich the appellant
at the cost of the Revenue. Further, the interpretation adopted by appellant
that the approach for grant of DEPB should keep in pace with advancement of
technology is also baseless for the reason that grant of any notification at
the cost of public revenue is not retrospective following the ratio laid down
by Apex Court in Sunwin Technology 2011 (21) STR 97 (SC). Accordingly grant of
the notification above cannot be stretched to grant benefit to past exports
made by the appellant misdeclarating description of the goods.
13.6 Appellants plea that the word colour used twice in sl. No. 17 of DEPB
Schedule was redundant is of no sense when the goods exported by the appellant
described its own identity. Misdeclaration of description of the goods by the
appellant was proved to be deliberate to make undue gain of DEPB scrips.
Therefore appellants were rightly brought to the fold off section 28 of the
Customs Act 1962 debarring the plea of time bar following the ratio laid down
by Apex Court in Candid Enterprises 2010 (130) ELT 404 (SC). When the
appellant was questioned as to the aforesaid deliberate misdeclaration it
surrendered before the law and made a deposit of the amount of
Rs.1,60,00,000/- which was appropriated by the ld. Adjudicating Authority
towards part of the duty demand made in the Adjudication which is under appeal
No. C/740/2008.
13.7 Appellant relied on the decision of the Honble High Court of Bombay in
the case of Pradip Polyfils Pvt. Ltd. V/s Union of India, 2004 (173) E.L.T. 3
(Bom.) to submit that Customs Authority has no power to sit over the decision
of the DGFT. Reliance of the appellant is misplaced when the fact of the said
case is looked into from Para 5 of the Judgment. Honble High Court in Para 5
of the Judgment framed the issue as to whether in respect of export of
articles of Poly propylene effected prior to the amendment of the public
notice on 15-12-1999, the Customs authorities were justified in holding that
the same being not covered under Chapter 39 of the ITC classification and the
petitioners are not eligible for benefit under DEPB Scheme. The issue so
framed by the Honble High Court, makes clear that if there is no
misdeclaration, the Customs Authority cannot interpret an entry in the DEPB
Schedule to their advantage. For that reason Honble High Court in Para 7 of
the Judgment categorically held that it is not the case of the Customs
Authority that there is any discrepancy in the description, quantity and FOB
value of the export product. Therefore, in the present appeals when there is
misdeclaration, appellants plea that Customs Authority has no power is not
tenable.
13.8 Appellant further relied on the decision of the Tribunal in the case of
M.K. Fisheries vs. CC, Cochin-2002(150) E.L.T. (Tri Chennai) to submit that
DGFT is ultimate Authority to issue DEPB scrips and use thereof cannot be
denied. The case related to claim of benefits on post-export basis. As per the
quadruplicate shipping bill which was sent by the appellants to the Office of
the DGFT, that office sanctioned the credit up to 4% of the FOB value declared
in the shipping bill and that was accepted by the Customs at the time of
exports. According to the procedure, Customs Authorities were required to
endorse the said decision of the DGFT on the pass-book on the basis of
sanction letter of DGFT. But customs Authority restricted the endorsement to
2% instead of 4%. Tribunal, following Apex Court decision in MJ Exports Ltd. -
1992(60) ELT 161 (SC) held that in all fairness, justice requires that if
Customs find any variation between misdeclaration of the goods as declared on
the shipping bill and as declared in the public notice issued by Customs House
for the same consignment, they would be entitled to bring such discrepancy to
the notice of the DGFT and await for further orders on the quantum of credit
to be given under DEPB for DGFT. Accordingly it was directed that Adjudicating
Authority shall refer the matter to the DGFT to have final say on the
described goods in the bill on entry whether falls within the scope of such
entry. But in the present case there was misdeclaration by appellant for which
it fails to succeed in its plea that Customs Authority should not question the
DEPB credit granted by DGFT.
13.9 Appellant further relied on 2003 (157) E.L.T. 662 (Tri.-Mumbai), Kabian
ECS India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Customs,-2003(157) ELT 662 (Tri-Mum)
to submit that customs has no power to question decision of DGFT. There is no
doubt that customs shall not dispute the export if there no variation or
misdeclaration of the description on the Bill of Entry. But in the present
case there was material departure to the declaration as to description of the
goods for which appellant fails to gain any benefit of that decision.
13.10 It was further relied on the decision in Vrundavan Exports vs.
Commissioner of Customs (Ex.), Mumbai - 2005 (191) E.L.T. 1036 (Tri.-Mumbai)
to submit that decision of the DGFT is final. No more description is called
for in view of following of the decision of 2003 (157) E.L.T. 662
(Tri.-Mumbai) by Tribunal in the above case i.e., Kabian ECS India Pvt. Ltd.
Vs. Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai which has been dealt in the preceding
para.
13.11 Reliance was also placed by the appellant on the decision in Ashok
Enterprises Vs Commissioner of Customs, Chennai 2005 (179) E.L.T 124
(Tri.-Chennai), which was an interim order of Tribunal. Such order having no
precedential value that has no relevance in final decision. Further the
Appellant failed to show how the decision of the Apex Court in I.T.C. Ltd. Vs
Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi-2004 (171) E.L.T. 433 (S.C.),
applies to its case.
14\. If a party makes representations which he knows to be false and injury
ensues therefrom although the motive from which the representations proceeded
may not have been bad is considered to be fraud in the eyes of law. It is also
well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud when that results
in deceiving and leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing
him to believe on falsehood. Of course, innocent misrepresentation may give
reason to claim relief against fraud. In the case of Commissioner of Customs,
Kandla v. Essar Oil Ltd. - 2004 (172) E.L.T. 433 (S.C.)it has been held that
by fraud is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any
expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill-will towards the
other is immaterial. Fraud involves two elements, deceit and injury to the
deceived.
15\. Undue advantage obtained by the deceiver will almost always cause loss or
detriment to the deceived. Similarly a fraud is an act of deliberate
deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of
another. It is a deception in order to gain by anothers loss. It is a
cheating intended to get an advantage. (See: S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v.
Jagannath [1994 (1) SCC 1:AIR 1994 SC 853]. It is said to be made when it
appears that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii)
without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly and carelessly whether it be
true or false [Ref: Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal [(2002) 1 SCC 100], Ram Preeti
Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate Education [(2003) 8 SCC
311], Ram Chandra Singhs case (supra) and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N.
and Another [(2004) 3 SCC 1].
16\. Suppression of a material fact would also amount to a fraud on the court
[(see Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amha Shankar Family Trust, (1996) 3 SCC 310 and
S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidus case (AIR 1994 SC 853)]. No judgment of a Court can
be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels
everything and fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of however
high a degree of solemnity. When fraud is established that unravels all. [Ref:
UOI v. Jain Shudh Vanaspati Ltd. - 1996 (86) E.L.T. 460 (S.C.) and in Delhi
Development Authority v. Skipper Construction Company (P) Ltd. - AIR 1996 SC
2005]. Any undue gain made at the cost of Revenue is to be restored back to
the treasury since fraud committed against Revenue voids all judicial acts,
ecclesiastical or temporal and DEPB scrip obtained playing fraud against the
public authorities are non est. So also no Court in this country can allow any
benefit of fraud to be enjoyed by anybody as is held by Apex Court in the case
of Chengalvaraya Naidu reported in 1994 (1) SCCI:AIR1994 SC 853. Ram Preeti
Yadav v/s U.P. Board High School and Inter Mediate Education (2003) 8 SCC 311.
17\. Evidence Act does not insist on absolute proof for the simple reason that
perfect proof in this imperfect world is seldom to be found. That is why under
Section 3 of the Evidence Act, a fact is said to be proved when, after
considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist or
considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the
circumstances of the particular case, acts upon the supposition that it
exists. This definition of proof does not draw any distinction between
circumstantial and other evidence. Preponderance of probability comes to
rescue of Revenue and Revenue is not required to prove its case by
mathematical precision. Thus, if circumstances establish that there is high
degree of probability that a prudent man ought to act on the supposition that
there was design to secure fake, false, forged or illegitimate DEPB scrip to
clear imports duty free in contravention of the law or abetting to achieve
such ill object, such act against public Revenue calls for penal consequence
to curb such mischief.
18\. A person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to seek relief in
equity [Ref: S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath, AIR 1994 SC 853]. It is a
fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he knows to be false, and
injury ensues therefrom although the motive from which the representations
proceeded may not have been bad.[Ref: Commissioner of Customs v. Essar Oil
Ltd., (2004) 11 SCC 364 = 2004 (172) E.L.T. 433 (S.C.)].
19\. When material evidence establishes fraud against Revenue, white collar
crimes committed under absolute secrecy shall not be exonerated as has been
held by Apex Court judgment in the case of K.I. Pavunny v. AC, Cochin - 1997
(90) E.L.T. 241 (S.C.). No adjudication is barred under Section 28 of the
Customs Act, 1962 if Revenue is defrauded for the reason that enactments like
Customs Act, 1962, and Customs Tariff Act, 1975 are not merely taxing statutes
but are also potent instruments in the hands of the Government to safeguard
interest of the economy. One of its measures is to prevent deceptive practices
of undue claim of fiscal incentives.
20\. It is cardinal principle of law which is enshrined in Section 17 of
Limitation Act that fraud nullifies everything for which plea of time bar is
untenable following the ratio laid down by Apex Court in the case of CC. v.
Candid Enterprises \- 2001 (130) E.L.T. 404 (S.C.). Non est instruments at all
times are void and void instrument in the eyes of law are no instruments.
Unlawful gain is thus debarred.
21\. Fraud and justice do not dwell together for which penal provisions are
enacted to eradicate evils of defrauding Revenue which is anti-social activity
adversely affecting public revenue. Such provisions are construed in the
manner which curbs the mischief, promote their object, prevent their subtle
evasion and foil their artful circumvention. Thus construed, the term fraud
within the meaning of these penal provisions is wide enough to take in its
fold any one or series of unlawful acts committed or omissions made. An act of
fraud on Revenue is always viewed seriously. Fraud and collusion vitiate
even the most solemn proceedings in any civilized system of jurisprudence. It
is a concept descriptive of human conduct either by letter or words, which
includes the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand
as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter.
22\. Applying the aforesaid principles of law, in these appeals, when material
evidence gathered by Revenue remains uncontroverted, adjudication findings
sustain. Accordingly appellants fail to succeeded on merit and on the fact and
circumstances of the cases. It can unambiguously be held that there was
deliberate misdeclaration of the description of goods exported and DEPB scrips
were fraudulently obtained. Use of such non est scrips to discharge import
duty against subsequent imports covered by the five appeals of the appellant
company is recoverable with penal consequences of law.
23\. It is also needless to say that no evasion occurs without human
intervention. Sri Sunil Goel is found to be instrumental to the wrongful claim
of DEPB scrips by the company appellant causing prejudice to the interest of
Revenue. Therefore on the facts and circumstances of the case as well as
evidence recorded, adjudication finding against him remain untouched.
24\. So far as the past consignments are concerned, record does not reveal
whether any of such exports were under bond or provisional assessment. Since
redemption requires existence of the goods, there shall not be imposition of
redemption fine against goods already exported and left India in all the five
appeals of the appellant company.
25\. It is trite that a judgment or decree by the first court or by the
highest court obtained by playing fraud on the Court is a nullity and non est
in the eye of law. [Ref. S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath \- (1994) 1 SCC
1 and India Household and Healthcare Ltd. v. LG Household & Healthcare Ltd. -
(2007) 5 SCC 510]. Therefore DEPB scrips obtained by the appellant Company in
all the appeals making deliberate misdeclaration of the description of the
goods in respect of past exports with intent to defraud Revenue, renders that
to be non est and debars it to make use thereof against import duty payable.
Accordingly, imports made using such DEPB scrips shall be liable to duty of
import followed by interest as well as redemption fine as has been adjudicated
in all these appeals. That part of the demand is hereby confirmed.
26\. The amount of Rs.1,60,00,000/- deposited and appropriated towards part of
the demand in these appeals of the company is held to be proper. Similarly the
value of bank guarantee of Rs.1,40,00,000/- is liable to be appropriated
against the demand.
27\. Penalty imposed on the appellant company in each appeal is reduced to 40%
thereof in the fitness of the circumstances of the case to deter evasion.
28\. Considering that no evasion occurs without human intervention and
intention to evade, penalty is also imposable on Sri Sunil Goel. However
considering facts and circumstances of the case, the same is reduced to 50% of
such imposition in each of the appeals.
29\. In the result all the appeals are partly allowed with the result and to
the extent aforesaid.
