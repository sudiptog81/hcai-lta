PRONOUNCED: JULY 20,2017 JUDGMENT: (PER A.S.OKA,J.) 1 These writ petitions can
be disposed together as the same relate to the same property. The subject
matter of these petitions is the property known as "Ewart House" situated at
22, Homi Mody Street, Fort, Mumbai 400 032 (for short "the said building").
The said building comprises of ground plus four upper floors. The respondent
in the Writ Petition No.1290 of 2015 and the petitioner in Writ  ::: Uploaded

Petition No.5315 of 2012 is Central Bank of India, which a body corporate
established under the provisions of the Bank Companies (Acquisition and
Approval of Undertakings) Act,1970 having its central office at Chandramukhi,
Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021. By a deed of conveyance dated 22 nd May 1972,
the Life Insurance Corporation of India sold the said building to Central Bank
of India (for short "the said Bank").
2 The said Bank filed an application before the Estate Officer appointed under
the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of unauthorized Occupants)
Act,1971 (for short "the said Act of 1971"). The eviction application was
filed against the petitioner in Writ Petition No.1290 of 2012 and the first
respondent in Writ Petition No.5315 of 2012 Dr.Preeti Bhatt (for the sake of
convenience referred as "the tenant"). It was stated in the said application
by the said Bank that the tenant was in occupation of a premises on the fourth
floor of the said building. It was stated that the area of the said premises
on the fourth floor was 1800 sq ft of carpet area (for short "the said
premises"). Monthly rent was Rs.683.85. In the application, it was stated that
by Advocate's notice dated 13 th June 2007, the tenancy of the tenant was
terminated by the said Bank and the tenant was called upon to vacate the said
premises. The tenant replied to the said notice raising various contentions.
The first prayer in the said application made before the Estate Officer was
for directing the tenant to hand ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 ::: Downloaded
on - 22/07/2017 00:23:52 ::: 3 wp1290-5315 over the vacant possession of the
said premises to the said Bank. The second prayer was for directing the tenant
to pay mesne profit at the rate of Rs.2,17,000/- per month with effect from
1st July 2007 till the date of handing over vacant possession of the said
premises to the said Bank with interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum.
3 The said application was contested by the tenant by filing a written
statement. It was contended in the written statement that her deceased father
Mr.R.S.Bhatt was the original tenant in respect of the said premises. She
stated that she was residing in the said premises right from the year 1950
with her father. It was contended that she was suffering from Cancer and that
she has been considered to be legally blind. She relied upon a medical
certificate issued to that effect. She contended that the notice of
termination of tenancy was illegal. She contended that the said Bank was not a
Statutory Authority within the meaning of sub clause (iii) of clause (f-a) of
section 2 of the said Act of 1971. The tenant denied the claim for
compensation made by the Bank.
4 Evidence was adduced before the Estate Officer by both the parties. The
Estate Officer by his Judgment and Order dated 24 th October 2011 directed the
tenant to vacate the said premises within a period of 15 days. He directed the
tenant to pay damages at the rate of Rs.1,83,600/- from 1 st July 2007 till
the date of handing over peaceful ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 ::: Downloaded
on - 22/07/2017 00:23:52 ::: 4 wp1290-5315 possession of the said premises to
the said Bank. Interest was made payable on the said amount with effect from
1st July 2007 at the rate of 6% per annum. Being aggrieved by the said
Judgment and Order of the Estate Officer, the tenant preferred an Appeal
before the City Civil and Sessions Court. By the Judgment and Order dated 12th
January 2012, the learned Judge of the City Civil Court partly allowed the
appeal. But the order of eviction was confirmed. However, the amount of
damages was reduced by quantifying the same at Rs.90,000/- per month. Being
aggrieved by the order of eviction and the order of payment of damages, the
tenant has preferred Writ Petition No.1290 of 2012. Being aggrieved by that
part of the Judgment and Order dated 12th January 2012 of the Appellate Court
by which the quantum of damages was reduced, the said Bank has filed a Writ
Petition No.5215 of 2012.
5 The submissions of the learned counsel for the tenant are three fold.
Firstly, he urged that there is evidence on record to show that the petitioner
falls in the category of persons with disability under the provisions of the
Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full
Participation) Act,1995 (for short "Disabilities Act"). He urged that the
impugned orders are vitiated as the rights of the tenant under the provisions
of the Disabilities Act have not been considered by the Estate Officer as well
as the Appellate Authority. The second submission is that the order of
eviction is contrary to the ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
22/07/2017 00:23:52 ::: 5 wp1290-5315 binding guidelines issued by the
Government of India. Lastly, he submitted that in view of the law laid down by
the Apex Court in the case of Suhas H. Pophale vs. Oriental Insurance Company
Limited and its Estate Officer1, the tenant cannot be evicted from the said
premises. His submission is that the said building in which the said premises
are situated was not vested in the said Bank on 24 th May 1972 and thus, the
said Act of 1971 will became applicable to the said building from the date of
the conveyance under which the Bank purchased the property. He submitted that
the father of the tenant was a tenant of the said premises even before vendor
of the said bank (Life Insurance Corporation of India) came into existence. He
submitted that in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
Suhas Pophale (supra), the order of eviction cannot be passed against the
tenant and the proceedings under the said Act of 1971 are not maintainable. He
urged that the Apex Court while deciding the case of Suhas Pophale has
extensively relied upon its earlier decision of Constitution Bench in the case
of Ashoka Marketing Limited vs. Punjab National Bank2. He submitted that not
only the application for review made by the respondents but also curative
petition filed by the respondents in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) has
been dismissed by order dated 10th September 2015.
     6        The learned counsel for the tenant relied upon 
     1 (2014) 4 SCC 657
     2   (1990) 4 SCC 406
    ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017           ::: Downloaded on - 22/07/2017 00:23:52 :::

the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija and
others vs. Collector, Thane and others3. He relied upon another decision of
the Apex Court in the case of Band Box Private Limited vs. Estate Officer,
Punjab and Sind Bank and another4. He relied upon another decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Punjab Land Development And Reclamation Corporation
Limited, Chandigarh Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Chandigarh and
others5. He submitted that as held in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra), there
is no conflict between the view in the said decision and the view taken by the
larger Bench in case of Ashoka Marketing and therefore, the decision in the
case of Suhas Pophale (supra) cannot be said to be per incuriam. Lastly, he
relied upon the decision in the case of Central Bank of India vs N.R.C.
Limited6. The learned counsel for the tenant also relied upon the provisions
of Rights of The Persons With Disabilities Act,2016 (for short "the said Act
of 2016") which came into force on 19th April 2017.
7 The learned counsel for the said Bank invited our attention to the fact that
the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Ashoka is by a Constitution
Bench consisting of five Hon'ble Judges. Relying upon various paragraphs of
the said Judgment, he would urge that what binds this Court is the decision in
the case of Ashoka Marketing 3 (1989) 3 SCC page 396 4 (2014) 16 SCC 321
5(1990) 3 SCC 682 6 (2014) 13 SCC 291 ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 22/07/2017 00:23:52 ::: 7 wp1290-5315 Limited (supra) which is
by a Constitution Bench, and therefore, the decision in the case of Suhas
Pophale (supra) will have to be held as per incuriam. He relied upon the
decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Mrs.Rani
Sevakram, (since deceased by her legal heirs) vs The Oriental Insurance
Company Limited and others7. He pointed out that by relying upon the decision
of the Apex Court in the case of Ashoka Marketing Limited and another (supra)
decision of this Court in the case of Kesar-I-Hind Private Limited and another
vs. National Textile Corporation Limited8, the learned Single Judge has come
to the conclusion that there was no merit in the contention that the owner has
to invoke the provisions of Bombay Rent Act or the Maharashtra Rent Control
Act. He submitted that a Full Bench of this Court has laid down the law that
when a Bench of High Court is required to consider two conflicting views of
the co-ordinate Benches of the Apex Court, the Bench has a choice to rely upon
one and discard the other. He submitted that the provisions of the
Disabilities Act will not render impugned orders invalid or illegal.
8 We have given careful consideration to the submissions. It is not in dispute
that father of the tenant was a tenant in respect of the said premises, even
before the predecessor in title of the Bank Life Insurance Corporation of
India came 7 Writ Petition No.2442 of 1994 decided on 28 th February 1989.

     into   existence.     He   was   in   possession   of   the   said 
premises as a tenant much prior to 16th September 1958\.
9 We have carefully perused the decision of the Apex Court in the case of
Suhas Pophale (supra). In the facts of the said case, the proceedings under
the said Act of 1971 were initiated in respect of a flat at Woodhouse Road,
Opposite Regal Cinema, Colaba, Mumbai-400005. One Mr.Eric Voller was a tenant
of an erstwhile Insurance Company which was the owner of the said premises. On
20th December 1972, the said Voller inducted the appellant before the Apex
Court in the said premises on Leave and Licence basis. Subsequently, the
appellant was accepted as a tenant by the erstwhile Insurance Company. The
management of the erstwhile Insurance company was taken over by the Central
Government on 13th May 1971. The said Insurance Company merged with the
Oriental Insurance Company Limited. The Competent Authority under the said Act
of 1971 passed an order of eviction against Mr.Voller and the appellant before
the Apex Court. The said order was confirmed in Appeal by the City Civil Court
and in a Writ Petition by this Court. The order of eviction was challenged by
the Appellant before the Apex Court. The law has been laid down in the said
decision in paragraphs 60, 64 to 66 which read thus:
> "60. It is true that Section 15 of the Public Premises Act creates a bar of
> jurisdiction to entertain suits or proceedings in respect of eviction of any
> person in an unauthorised occupation. However, as far as the relationship

> Bombay Rent Act under Article 254(1) of the Constitution of India. This was,
> however, in the matter of the subjects covered under the Public Premises Act
> viz. eviction of unauthorised occupants and recovery of arrears of rent,
> etc. as stated above. Thereafter, if the State Legislature wanted to cover

(emphasis added) 10 In the present case, the tenant's father was admittedly a
tenant of the said premises before the predecessor of the said Bank, Life
Insurance Corporation of India, came into existence. Moreover, the
petitioner's father was admittedly a tenant of the said premises prior to 16th
September 1958. The petitioner's father died on 9th September 1997. At that
time, the petitioner was staying with him in the said premises. The petitioner
became the tenant on her father's death. In view of what is held in paragraph
64 above, the proceedings under the said Act of 1971 against the tenant are
not competent. In ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 22/07/2017
00:23:52 ::: 12 wp1290-5315 view of what is held by the Apex Court in the case
of Suhas Pophale (supra) in especially in paragraph 64, the order of eviction
under the said Act of 1971 could not have been passed against the tenant who
along with her father occupied the premises from the year 1950. When the said
Bank became the owner of the said premises, the tenant's father was already a
tenant of the said premises. The proceedings against the tenant under the said
Act of 1971 are not competent in the present case.
11 An argument was canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
the said decision in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) is per incuriam as it
lays down the law which is contrary to the law laid down in the case of Ashoka
Marketing (supra) by the Constitution Bench. We must note here that the Apex
Court in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) has extensively considered the
decision in the case of Ashoka Marketing and has specifically recorded a
finding that the view taken in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) is not in
conflict with the decision in the case of Ashoka Marketing. Thus, in terms,
the Apex Court in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) has held that what is
decided by the said decision is not in conflict with the decision of the
Constitution Bench in the case of Ashoka Marketing (supra). Hence, it is not
open for us to hold that the decision in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) is
per incuriam.
     12       We may make a useful reference to the decision

of the Apex Court in the case of Band Box Private Limited (supra). The Apex
Court dealt with a specific argument that the decision in the case of Suhas
Pophale is erroneous in the light of the earlier decisions of the Apex Court
in the cases of Ashoka Marketing and Kaiser-I-Hind Private Limited. In
paragraphs 7 to 10 it was held thus:
> "7. There are two other submissions raised by Mr Vikas Singh. Firstly, he

In the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Mrs.Rani Sevakram
vs. Oriental Insurance Company, he has held that in view of the decision in
the case of Ashoka Marketing, the decision in the case of Suhas Pophale is not
a binding precedent. In ::: Uploaded on - 21/07/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
22/07/2017 00:23:52 ::: 15 wp1290-5315 view of the above decision, the view
taken by the learned Single Judge is not correct.
13 One of the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the Bank was that
one one hand in view of the decision in the case of Suhas Pophale (supra) the
said premises will continue to be a public premises within the meaning of the
said Act of 1971 and on the other hand, the jurisdiction of the other Courts
to deal with the proceedings for eviction is ousted by section 15 of the said
Act of 1971. His submission based on the provisions of the Maharashtra Rent
Control Act,1999 is that the Bank will be without any remedy for evicting the
tenant as the said premises continue to be a public premises within the
meaning of the said Act of 1971. The said argument is not relevant at all. The
only question which we are examining is whether the order of eviction against
the tenant is legal and valid. As the law laid down in the case of Suhas
Pophale is squarely applicable to the case, the order of eviction and
consequently the order of grant of damages will have to be set aside only on
the ground that the order of eviction could not have been passed against the
tenant under the provisions of the said Act of 1971, as proceedings under the
said Act of 1971 are not competent. As we are setting aside the impugned
Judgments, on this ground, it is not necessary to deal with the other two
submissions of the tenant.
