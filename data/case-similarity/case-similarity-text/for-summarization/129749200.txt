    CORAM:
    HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA
    1.     Roderick John Andrew Mackenzie, the plaintiff in CS(OS) No.
    205/2009 filed the suit inter alia seeking permanent injunction restraining
    the defendants their employees, servants, agents etc. from using or
    otherwise copying, selling, offering for sale, counterfeit/unlicensed versions
    of the plaintiff's copyright in his artistic work "HIMLAYAN HELI
    SERVICES" in any shape, form or manner amounting to infringement of
    the plaintiff's copyright, damages, rendition of accounts and delivery up of
    all impugned materials.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009                  Page 1 of 46
     2.     In the plaint which was filed through the duly appointed special
    power of attorney of the plaintiff namely Vikrant Singh Jafa, it is stated that
    the plaintiff is the original author/creator, lawful owner and proprietor of
    the copyright in the artistic work titled "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES"
    in Australia, India and worldwide. The said copyright has been registered in
    favour of the plaintiff in India on 28th Jan 2008. It is stated that the
    defendant is wrongly and illegally using the plaintiff's copyright in the
    artistic work titled "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES" on its websites, letter
    heads, stationery, business cards etc. It is further claimed that the
    defendant's logo has an identical get up, layout and features as that of the
    plaintiff's.    Plaintiff has been a mountaineer who has climbed Mount
    Everest twice in 1984 and 1989 and has extensive experience of numerous
    expeditions in the Himalayas in India, Nepal, New Zealand, Europe, USA
    etc. The plaintiff has developed patented technology for the analysis of
    snow and avalanche prediction and has been involved in research and
    development for the Defence Research and Development Organization
    (DRDO) and the Snow and Avalanche Studies Establishment (SASE) in
    Manali. Besides being the owner of the copyright in the artistic work,
    plaintiff is also the first user of the aforesaid artistic work within the
    meaning of the Section 17 of the Copyright Act and entitled to all exclusive
    rights flowing from such ownership as per Section 15 of the Copyright Act.
    3.     Defendant is a private limited company claiming to be engaged in the
    business of conducting helicopter operations. Plaintiff noticed on the
    internet and elsewhere that the defendant has been infringing the plaintiff's
    copyright and has titled it as "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES" and is
    using the artistic work of the plaintiff consisting of pictorial representations
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 2 of 46
     of the said artistic work with identical shades, lay-out, features, get-up etc.
    on its websites, letter heads, stationery, business cards etc. Plaintiff also
    stated that he was the director of Himachal Helicopter Skiing Private
    Limited which has other matters in issue with the defendant, however, the
    present suit relates only to the copyright infringement arising out of the
    international right of the plaintiff. It is claimed that the defendant is
    infringing the artistic work of the plaintiff by means of posting the insignia
    in the various exhibitions, galleries, newspaper etc both in Delhi and Trans
    border.
    4.     Pursuant to summons being issued, written statement was filed on
    behalf of the defendant through its Director T. Wangchuk Shamshu. In the
    written statement preliminary objections were taken particularly in respect
    of suppression of material facts. It was stated that the defendant company
    i.e. Himlayan Heli Services Private Limited was incorporated in July, 1998
    as a 100% subsidiary of the World Expeditions (India) Private Limited,
    established in August, 1987. The said company was owned and promoted
    by Harsh Vardhan Sharma and Wangchuk Shamshu, both citizens of India
    and pioneers in India in the field of adventure tourism like skiing, trekking
    and rafting. In 1989 Harsh Vardhan and Wangchuk decided to get together
    and do business jointly and formed the company in the name and style of
    World Expeditions Private Limited. In and around 1989-90 plaintiff
    expressed his keenness to do business in India in the area of heli skiing
    which at that point of time was only being conducted in Kashmir through
    M/s Himalayan Heli Ski, a company belonging to Mr. Soudan. A working
    arrangement was entered into between M/s World Expeditions Private
    limited and the plaintiff to organize tours for heli skiing in Manali,
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 3 of 46
     Himachal Pradesh as a part of the business which activity could be
    conducted only for a period of 12 weeks in a year in the months of January
    to March.
    5.     As per the written statement plaintiff wanted to conduct the said
    activity under the name and style of Himalayan Heli Skiing, which was
    deceptively similar to Mr. Soudan's outfit, and on the defendant's objection
    to the same, plaintiff changed the name of his operations to Himachal
    Helicopter Skiing with a logo being a triangular mountain with a ski trail
    surrounded by clouds. Later, since the defendant company was providing
    helicopters to pilgrims as well as adventure tourists, the nomenclature was
    changed from M/s World Expedition Private Limited to "HIMLAYAN
    HELI SERVICES" Private Limited. On the formation of the defendant in
    the year 1998, the defendant designed/ caused to be designed a logo/ artistic
    work depicting a helicopter in a triangle with clouds around it, the triangle
    reflecting the mountains. The clouds were put on the suggestion of the
    plaintiff with whom Harsh Vardhan and Wangchuk were having regular
    dealings. It is stated that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the trade name
    or trade mark "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES" which was not the
    business of the plaintiff who was doing only skiing. Thus there was no
    comparison between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff was a
    skiing instructor, bringing groups for skiing holidays, whereas the
    defendant is an Air Taxi Operator operating helicopters. In fact plaintiff
    does not and cannot provide heli services as permission to provide the said
    service is with the defendant only. In the written statement defendant stated
    about the goodwill and the quantum of its business.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 4 of 46
     6.     In the written statement it is also stated that providing of helicopter
    services in the remote mountaineers regions was not free from danger and
    risk. Mr. Wangchuk who is a practicing Buddhist, incorporated in the logo
    of the defendant the symbol of 'Dorje". In Buddhism, the 'Dorje", also
    known as 'Vajra', is considered to be very auspicious and a powerful
    symbol and mythological weapon that destroys ignorance and is itself
    indestructible. It is stated that M/s Mahavir Printers was engaged to design
    a suitable logo for the defendant with a 'Dorje' and out of the various
    designs given defendant selected the present logo/insignia. Thus the
    original artistic work in this logo containing the dorje/vajra is of the
    defendant and not the plaintiff.
    7.     It is further stated that in 2006 defendant had a serious dispute with
    the plaintiff and his organization M/s Himachal Helicopter Skiing as the
    plaintiff used defendant's helicopter to lift load which was impermissible
    under the terms of license and realizing his mistake the plaintiff tendered a
    written apology. The relation between the parties strained and despite
    repeated reminders the plaintiff failed to pay to the defendant a sum of
    approximately USD 36,000 which is due towards plaintiff. Defendant in the
    written statement further claims that the plaintiff all through this period was
    associated with the defendant and was fully aware of the logos being used
    by the defendant and the plaintiff only used a ski trail in a triangular
    mountain surrounded by clouds. The defendant was surprised to know as to
    how the plaintiff clandestinely registered logos and trade mark in his name
    in January 2008. Further, even after 2008 the plaintiff never issued any
    notice to the answering defendant complaining of infringement and filed
    the present suit. Thus, the suit is liable to be dismissed not only on the
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 5 of 46
     account that the plaintiff had not made out any case but also on the ground
    of concealment of material facts as noted above and that the defendant has
    been using its own logo with a helicopter in a triangular mountain clouds
    and dorge/vajra in "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES".
    8.     On the pleadings of the parties the following issues were settled:
              i.   Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction to
                   restrain the Defendant from using the artistic work
                   'HIMALAYAN HELI SERVICES'? (OPP)
             ii.   Whether the Plaintiff has any right, title or interest or
                   copyright in the artistic work 'HIMALAYAN HELI
                   SERVICES'? (OPP)
            iii.   Whether the Defendant is the owner of the copyright in the
                   artistic work 'HIMALAYAN HELI SERVICES'? (OPD)
            iv.    Whether the Plaintiff has acquiesced in the Defendant's
                   use of the said artistic work? (OPD)
             v.    Whether the suit is barred by limitation and laches?
                   (OPD)
            vi.    Whether the Plaintiff has suppressed material facts and the
                   effect thereof? (OPP)
           vii.    Relief.
    9.     Plaintiff filed his own evidence by way of affidavit and examined
    himself as the sole witness PW-1. In the evidence by way of affidavit,
    plaintiff deposed the facts as stated in the plaint claiming himself to be the
    first user of the copyright in the artistic work and also that he was the
    registered owner thereof.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 6 of 46
     10.    On behalf of the defendant its Director Harsh Vardhan Sharma
    examined himself as a witness being DW-1 and deposed on the lines of the
    averments in the written statement as noted above.
    11.    Before dealing with issues No. (i), (iv), (v) and (vi) it would be
    appropriate to deal with issues No.(ii) and (iii).
    12.    Issue No.(ii): Whether the Plaintiff has any right, title or interest or
    copyright in the artistic work 'HIMALAYAN HELI SERVICES'? (OPP) and
    Issue No. (iii): Whether the Defendant is the owner of the copyright in the
    artistic work 'HIMALAYAN HELI SERVICES'?(OPD)
    12.1. Contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is that the
    defendant themselves admitted that the plaintiff had been using the logo of
    a triangular mountain with the skiing trail surrounded by clouds, thus the
    subsequent adoption of the defendants of the logo with a helicopter in a
    mountain and the clouds not only infringes the plaintiff's artistic work but
    also amounts to passing off. Defendant has also admitted that the clouds in
    the purported logo of the defendant i.e. a helicopter in a triangle, were put
    at the suggestion of the plaintiff. Further, defendant's witness admitted that
    the plaintiff has been using the artistic work in his communication since
    1990. It is further stated that the defendant is not the owner of the copyright
    work and it is the plaintiff who has been using the logo of the mountain in
    the clouds since 1988. The defendant company came into existence with the
    co-operation of the plaintiff. Plaintiff shared his logo which the defendant
    company who would have never imagined or visualized the artistic work
    which originally belonged to the plaintiff. Defendant has never taken steps
    to register their so called artistic work and after the relationship between the
    parties terminated the plaintiff took steps to get registered his artistic work
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 7 of 46
     in the year 2008 which protection was granted to him. Thus, plaintiff is
    entitled to the decree as prayed for.
    12.2. Learned counsel for the defendant contends that the logo has been
    designed in view of the nature of the business of the defendant that is of
    private helicopter services in the Himalayas. Further, the helicopter
    mountain and clouds and the artistic work of using of "Vajra" in the capital
    (H) has been used by the defendants since its incorporation in 1998.
    Defendant has acquired goodwill and reputation in its name/mark over this
    period. As noted above in the documents used by the plaintiff even prior to
    the year 1998-99 when he associated with the defendant, the plaintiff had
    only been using mountain in the clouds with a ski trail.
    12.3. It is trite law that copyright inheres in the author or the creator of the
    artistic work the moment the work is created and registration of the
    copyright is merely a prima facie evidence that the artist is the owner of the
    copyright. However, if the person is not the author or the creator of the
    artistic work registration of the artistic work cannot vest copyright in the
    person.
    12.4. The three judge bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision
    reported as 1978 (4) SCC 118 R.G. Anand vs. M/s Delux Films & Ors.
    laying down the law to determine the infringement of the copyright held
    that where a charge of violation of the copyright is made by the plaintiff
    against the defendant the fundamental fact which has to be determined is
    whether or not the defendant not only adopted the idea of the copyrighted
    work but has also adopted the manner, arrangement, situation to situation,
    scene to scene with minor changes or super additions or embellishment
    here and there. Indeed, if on a perusal of the copyrighted work the
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 8 of 46
     defendant's work appears to be a transparent rephrasing or a copy of a
    substantial and material part of the original, the charge of plagiarism must
    stand proved. Care however must be taken to see whether the defendant has
    merely disguised piracy or has actually reproduced the original in different
    form, different tone, different tenor so as to infuse a new life into the idea
    of the copyrighted work adapted by him. In the latter case there is no
    violation of the copyright.
    12.5. Considering the various authorities and the case law on the subject
    Supreme Court laid down the following principles:
          "1. There can be no copyright in an idea, subject-matter,
              themes, plots or historical or legendary facts and violation
              of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,
              manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the
              author of the copyrighted work.
          2. Where the same idea is being developed in a different
              manner, it is manifest that the source being common,
              similarities are bound to occur. In such a case the courts
              should determine whether or not the similarities are on
              fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of
              expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the
              defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the
              copyrighted work with some variations here and there it
              would amount to violation of the copyright. In other words,
              in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and
              material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the
              defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.
          3. One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or
              not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the
              reader, spectator or the viewer after having read or seen
              both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an
              unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears
              to be a copy of the original.
          4. Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated
              differently so that the subsequent work becomes a
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009           Page 9 of 46
                 completely new work, no question of violation of copyright
                arises.
          5.    Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the
                two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities
                which negative the intention to copy the original and the
                coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly
                incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into
                existence.
          6.    As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it
                must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying
                the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above.
          7.    Where however the question is of the violation of the
                copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the
                task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy.
                It is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much
                broader prospective, wider field and a bigger background
                where the defendants can by introducing a variety of
                incidents give a colour and complexion different from the
                manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the
                idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film gets
                atotality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of
                the original play, violation of the copyright may be said to
                be proved.
    12.6. The two mark Nos. A81931/2008 and A81932/2008 noted below
    have been registered in favour of the plaintiff.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009              Page 10 of 46
     12.7. In the plaint and the evidence, claim of the plaintiff is that he was
    using mountain in the triangular form with the cloud and when the
    Himalayan Heli Services, defendant No.1 was incorporated even as per the
    admission of the defendant it was the idea of the plaintiff that the triangle
    which depicted a mountain should be surrounded by the clouds, however
    plaintiff has placed no documents on record to show that prior to 1998 the
    plaintiff was using the mark "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES" whereas
    defendant has placed on record documents to show that before plaintiff
    joined the joint venture i.e. Himlayan Heli Services Private Limited as
    noted above, his organization was called as M/s.Himachal Helicopter
    Skiing and M/s.Himachal Helicopter Skiing was using the logo being a
    triangular mountain with a ski trail surrounded by clouds. Thus even if the
    plaintiff can be held to be the creator of the artistic work of a triangular
    mountain in the clouds depicted in a particular manner, the same was being
    used with a ski trail as the major work of the plaintiff was skiing
    expedition. Further the copyright is claimed in the composite mark
    including Himalayan Heli Services with the logo of mountain with clouds
    and a helicopter and not merely in the mountain depicted as a triangle with
    clouds around. He nowhere used the Helicopter in the triangle depicting
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009           Page 11 of 46
     the mountain. DW-1 in his evidence has admitted that the plaintiff had been
    using the mountain with the clouds and a ski trail therein as a logo qua his
    services rendered as Himachal Helicopter Skiing. Thus neither the plaintiff
    nor the defendant can claim any copyright in the artistic work for which
    registration has been granted to the plaintiff vide registration No.A-
    81931/2008 i.e. triangular mountain with the clouds and a helicopter therein
    even though the same was being used as a logo for the joint venture of the
    defendant No.1.
    12.8. As regards the second copyright of the plaintiff wherein Himalayan
    Heli Services is depicted with a Dorje/Vajra neither in the plaint nor in the
    evidence the plaintiff claims that he was the creator or author of the said
    artistic work. Merely because the copyright has been granted in favour of
    the plaintiff the same would not inure a right to the plaintiff. None of the
    documents of the plaintiff show that before joining the joint venture of the
    defendant, the plaintiff was using Dorje/Vajra in the words Himalayan Heli
    Services.      In fact the plaintiff was not even using the trade mark
    "HIMLAYAN HELI SERVICES". Since qua copyright in registration No.
    A-81932/2008 plaintiff has not led any evidence to show that plaintiff is the
    creator of the copyright with 'Vajra' in between the Himalayan Heli
    Services, it cannot be held that the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright
    granted to him vide registration No.A-81932/2008.
    12.9. In respect of the copyright granted to the plaintiff vide registration
    No.A-81932/2008 the defendant claims that this Vajra was added as it is
    very auspicious and powerful symbol besides being a mythological weapon
    that destroys ignorance and is itself indestructible. Defendant claims that
    this design was given to the printer, however except the bald assertion, no
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009           Page 12 of 46
     further evidence has been led that the defendant is the creator of the artistic
    work qua registration No. A-81932/2008.
    12.10. Thus in respect of issue No. (ii) and (iii) neither the plaintiff nor the
    defendant can claim copyright in the two registration marks.
    13.    Issue No. (vi): Whether the Plaintiff has suppressed material facts
    and the effect thereof? (OPP)
    13.1. Though as per the issue settled the onus to prove this issue was on
    the plaintiff, however, as noted from the written statement and the language
    of the issue the onus to prove this issue has to be on the defendant.
    13.2. Contention of learned counsel for the defendant is that from the facts
    proved by the evidence of defendant the claim of the plaintiff that it had
    been solely using the logos in question for a very long period and came to
    know only on 28th January, 2009 about the use of logos by the defendant on
    the internet is incorrect and suppresses the facts that both the parties were
    in relation with each other, since 1998 the plaintiff has not used the logos
    and plaintiff has not placed on record any material that he was conducting
    the business of heli skiing, hence, his entire case stands falsified.
    13.3. Contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff is that the plaintiff in
    para 24(b) of the plaint has stated that in respect of the other matters with
    the defendant separate suits were being filed and the plaintiff in two other
    suits has given his entire relationship with the defendant which complies
    with the requirement of law. The fact of relationship between the two
    parties was clearly spelt out and known to the court and since the present
    suit only related to copyright infringement unnecessary facts were not
    pleaded. The same would not amount to suppression of material facts.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009              Page 13 of 46
     13.4. In the present suit claim of the plaintiff is for injunction restraining
    the defendants from using its copyright in the artistic work "HIMLAYAN
    HELI SERVICES" damages, rendition of accounts and delivery up of the
    impugned material.
    13.5. In para 14B of the plaint, plaintiff has stated that the plaintiff,
    Director of Himachal Helicopter Skiing Private Limited had other matters
    in issue with the defendant, however, the present suit is being laid in strict
    compass of copyright infringement arising out of the individual rights of
    the plaintiff.
    13.6. No doubt, the plaintiff was not required to elaborate its relationship
    with the defendant, however, it was required on the part of the plaintiff to
    have pleaded that the plaintiff had been working with the defendant from
    1989 to 2006 when disputes arose between the parties. As a joint venture
    both the plaintiff and the defendant were using logos falsifying the claim of
    the plaintiff as an exclusive user. Further the claim of the plaintiff that he
    came to know about defendant's user before filing of the suit is also
    falsified by the documents placed on record by the defendant.
    13.7. In the decision reported as M/s Continental Foundation (supra)
    relating to Section 11(a) of the Central Excise Act, 1944, Supreme Court
    explained the meaning of "suppression" as failure to disclose full
    information with the intention to evade payment of duty.
    13.8. Supreme Court in the decision reported as (2012) 11 SCC 574
    Badami v. Bhali while dealing with concealment of material facts in a suit
    noted as under:
             "29. Presently, we shall refer as to how this Court has dealt
             with concept of fraud. In S.B. Noronah v. Prem Kumari
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009           Page 14 of 46
              Khanna [(1980) 1 SCC 52: AIR 1980 SC 193] while dealing
             with the concept of estoppel and fraud a two-Judge Bench has
             stated that: (SCC p. 58, para 20)
                  "20. It is an old maxim that estoppels are odious,
                  although considerable inroad into this maxim has been
                  made by modern law. Even so, 'a judgment obtained by
                  fraud or collusion, even, it seems, a judgment of the
                  House of Lords, may be treated as a nullity'. (See
                  Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 16, 4th Edn., para
                  1553.) The point is that the sanction granted under
                  Section 21, if it has been procured by fraud or collusion,
                  cannot withstand invalidity because, otherwise, high
                  public policy will be given as hostage to successful
                  collusion."
             30. In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath [(1994) 1 SCC
             1] this Court commenced the verdict with the following words:
             (SCC p. 2, para 1)
                  "1. 'Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or
                  temporal' observed Chief Justice Edward Coke of
                  England about three centuries ago. It is the settled
                  proposition of law that a judgment or decree obtained by
                  playing fraud on the court is a nullity and non est in the
                  eye of the law. Such a judgment/decree--by the first court
                  or by the highest court--has to be treated as a nullity by
                  every court, whether superior or inferior. It can be
                  challenged in any court even in collateral proceedings."
             In the said case it was clearly stated that the courts of law are
             meant for imparting justice between the parties and one who
             comes to the court, must come with clean hands.
             31. A person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to
             approach the court. A litigant who approaches the court, is
             bound to produce all the documents executed by him which are
             relevant to the litigation. If a vital document is withheld in
             order to gain advantage on the other side he would be guilty of
             playing fraud on court as well as on the opposite party.

              32. In Shrisht Dhawan v. Shaw Bros. [(1992) 1 SCC 534 : AIR
             1992 SC 1555] it has been opined that the fraud and collusion
             vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any civilised
             system of jurisprudence. It has been defined as an act of
             trickery or deceit. The aforesaid principle has been reiterated
             in Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal [(2002) 1 SCC 100 : 2002 SCC
             (L&S) 97 : AIR 2002 SC 33] , Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board
             of High School and Intermediate Education [(2003) 8 SCC
             311] and Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [(2003) 8 SCC
             319] .
             33. In State of A.P. v. T. Suryachandra Rao [(2005) 6 SCC
             149] after referring to the earlier decision this Court observed
             as follows: (SCC p. 155, para 16)
             "16. In Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley [(1956) 1 QB 702:
             (1956) 2 WLR 502 : (1956) 1 All ER 341] Lord Denning
             observed at QB p. 712:
             '... No judgment of a court, no order of a minister, can be
             allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud
             unravels everything.'
             In the same judgment Lord Parker, L.J. observed that fraud
             'vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a
             degree of solemnity' (Lazarus case [(1956) 1 QB 702 : (1956)
             2 WLR 502 : (1956) 1 All ER 341] , QB p. 722)."
             34. Yet in another decision Hamza Haji v. State of Kerala
             [(2006) 7 SCC 416 : AIR 2006 SC 3028] it has been held that
             no court will allow itself to be used as an instrument of fraud
             and no court, by way of rule of evidence and procedure, can
             allow its eyes to be closed to the fact it is being used as an
             instrument of fraud. The basic principle is that a party who
             secures the judgment by taking recourse to fraud should not be
             enabled to enjoy the fruits thereof."
    13.9. In (2010) 8 SCC 383 Meghmala v. G. Narasimha Reddy Supreme
    Court observed:
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 16 of 46
              "Fraud/misrepresentation
             28. It is settled proposition of law that where an applicant gets
             an order/office by making misrepresentation or playing fraud
             upon the competent authority, such order cannot be sustained
             in the eye of the law. "Fraud avoids all judicial acts,
             ecclesiastical or temporal." (Vide S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu
             v. Jagannath [(1994) 1 SCC 1 : AIR 1994 SC 853] .) In
             Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley [(1956) 1 QB 702 : (1956) 2
             WLR 502 : (1956) 1 All ER 341 (CA)] the Court observed
             without equivocation that: (QB p. 712) "No judgment of a
             court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has
             been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."
             29. In A.P. State Financial Corpn. v. GAR Re-Rolling Mills
             [(1994) 2 SCC 647 : AIR 1994 SC 2151] and State of
             Maharashtra v. Prabhu [(1994) 2 SCC 481 : 1994 SCC (L&S)
             676 : (1994) 27 ATC 116] this Court observed that a writ
             court, while exercising its equitable jurisdiction, should not
             act as to prevent perpetration of a legal fraud as the courts are
             obliged to do justice by promotion of good faith. "Equity is
             always known to defend the law from crafty evasions and new
             subtleties invented to evade law."
             30. In Shrisht Dhawan v. Shaw Bros. [(1992) 1 SCC 534 : AIR
             1992 SC 1555] it has been held as under: (SCC p. 553, para
             20)
                   "20. Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn
                   proceedings in any civilised system of jurisprudence. It is
                   a concept descriptive of human conduct."
             31. In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rajendra Singh
             [(2000) 3 SCC 581 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 726 : AIR 2000 SC 1165]
             this Court observed that "Fraud and justice never dwell
             together" (fraus et jus nunquam cohabitant) and it is a pristine
             maxim which has never lost its temper over all these centuries.
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 17 of 46
              32. The ratio laid down by this Court in various cases is that
             dishonesty should not be permitted to bear the fruit and benefit
             to the persons who played fraud or made misrepresentation
             and in such circumstances the Court should not perpetuate the
             fraud. (See Vizianagaram Social Welfare Residential School
             Society v. M. Tripura Sundari Devi [(1990) 3 SCC 655 : 1990
             SCC (L&S) 520 : (1990) 14 ATC 766] , Union of India v. M.
             Bhaskaran [1995 Supp (4) SCC 100 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 162 :

             Girdharilal Yadav [(2004) 6 SCC 325 : 2005 SCC (L&S) 785],
             State of Maharashtra v. Ravi Prakash Babulalsing Parmar
             [(2007) 1 SCC 80 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 5] , Himadri
             Chemicals Industries Ltd. v. Coal Tar Refining Co. [(2007) 8
             SCC 110 : AIR 2007 SC 2798] and Mohd. Ibrahim v. State of
             Bihar [(2009) 8 SCC 751 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 929] .)
             33. Fraud is an intrinsic, collateral act, and fraud of an
             egregious nature would vitiate the most solemn proceedings of
             courts of justice. Fraud is an act of deliberate deception with a
             design to secure something, which is otherwise not due. The
             expression "fraud" involves two elements, deceit and injury to
             the person deceived. It is a cheating intended to get an
             advantage. [Vide Vimla (Dr.) v. Delhi Admn. [AIR 1963 SC
             1572 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 434] , Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres
             (India) (P) Ltd. [(1996) 5 SCC 550] , State of A.P. v. T.
             Suryachandra Rao [(2005) 6 SCC 149 : AIR 2005 SC 3110] ,
             K.D. Sharma v. SAIL [(2008) 12 SCC 481] and Central Bank
             of India v. Madhulika Guruprasad Dahir [(2008) 13 SCC 170:
             (2009) 1 SCC (L&S) 272] .]
             34. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously. A
             collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the
             others in relation to a property would render the transaction
             void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although
             in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is
             anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted
             with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application
             of any equitable doctrine including res judicata. Fraud is
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 18 of 46
              proved when it is shown that a false representation has been
             made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii)
             recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Suppression of
             a material document would also amount to a fraud on the
             court. (Vide S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu [(1994) 1 SCC 1 : AIR
             1994 SC 853] , Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family
             Trust [(1996) 3 SCC 310 : AIR 1996 SC 2202] , Ram Chandra
             Singh v. Savitri Devi [(2003) 8 SCC 319] , Roshan Deen v.
             Preeti Lal [(2002) 1 SCC 100 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 97 : AIR
             2002 SC 33] , Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School
             & Intermediate Education [(2003) 8 SCC 311 : AIR 2003 SC
             4268] and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N. [(2004) 3 SCC
             1: AIR 2004 SC 2836] )
             35. In Kinch v. Walcott [1929 AC 482 : 1929 All ER Rep 720
             (PC)] it has been held that:
                  "... mere constructive fraud is not, at all events after long
                  delay, sufficient but such a judgment will not be set aside
                  upon mere proof that the judgment was obtained by
                  perjury".
             Thus, detection/discovery of constructive fraud at a much
             belated stage may not be sufficient to set aside the judgment
             procured by perjury.
             36. From the above, it is evident that even in judicial
             proceedings, once a fraud is proved, all advantages gained by
             playing fraud can be taken away. In such an eventuality the
             questions of non-executing of the statutory remedies or
             statutory bars like doctrine of res judicata are not attracted.
             Suppression of any material fact/document amounts to a fraud
             on the court. Every court has an inherent power to recall its
             own order obtained by fraud as the order so obtained is non
             est."
    13.10. As noted above the plaintiff with defendant was using the copyrights
    in the artistic works and was not the exclusive user nor creator of the
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 19 of 46
     complete artistic work in copyright registration Nos. A-81931/2008 and A-
    81932/2008, which facts have a direct bearing on the reliefs sought in the
    plaint. Thus it cannot be held that there was no concealment of material
    facts.
    13.11. Thus Issue No.(vi) is decided in favour of the defendant and against
    the plaintiff and it is held that the plaintiff concealed material facts in the
    plaint which had a direct bearing on the reliefs sought.
    14.      Issue No. (iv): Whether the Plaintiff has acquiesced in the
    Defendant's use of the said artistic work?(OPD)
    14.1. Plaintiff to prove his case has exhibited its certificate of registration
    in respect of the logo triangular with a helicopter in between, along with the
    clouds and Himalayan Heli Services with the "Vajra" as Ex. PW-1/1 to 1/3
    respectively.
    14.2. The documents in support of the exclusive use of these logos
    exhibited by the plaintiff are of the year 2008 after he parted company from
    the defendants.
    14.3. Defendant has exhibited documents relating back to the year 1993,
    1995 and 2006 showing that in the course of its business with the plaintiff,
    defendant had been using the logos. Defendant has also placed on record
    documents of the Himachal Heli Skiing wherein the triangle used by the
    plaintiff is with a ski trail and not a helicopter. Thus the claim of the
    plaintiff that it came to know about the infringement only in January 2009
    is falsified.
    14.4. Supreme Court in the decision reported as (1994)2 SCC 448 Power
    Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd encapsulating the law on
    acquiescence held:
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 20 of 46
            "25.    If there is an infringement of the same whether the
           appellant would be entitled to interim injunction at this stage is
           the important question for determination. For such a
           determination, we refrain from going into the details relating to
           evidence as that will prejudice the parties in the suits. Section
           30(1)(b) of the 1958 Act says:
           "30. Acts not constituting infringement.-- (1) Notwithstanding
           anything contained in this Act, the following acts do not
           constitute an infringement of the right to the use of a registered
           trade mark--
           (a) ***
           (b) the use by a person of a trade mark in relation to goods
           connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a
           registered user of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk
           of which they form part, the registered proprietor or the
           registered user conforming to the permitted use has applied the
           trade mark and has not subsequently removed or obliterated it,
           or has at any time expressly or impliedly consented to the use of
           the trade mark."
            Therefore, acquiescence is one of the defences still available to
           the first respondent. Of course, it is a different issue whether
           the plea of acquiescence has been made out in this case. That
           will be examined for a limited purpose after setting out the law
           on this aspect.
           26. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the
           rights and spending money on it. It is a course of conduct
           inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights in a trade mark,
           trade name etc. It implies positive acts; not merely silence or
           inaction     such      as      is     involved      in     laches.
           In Harcourt v. White [(1860) 28 Beav 303 : 54 ER 382] Sr.
           John Romilly said: "It is important to distinguish mere
           negligence and acquiescence." Therefore, acquiescence is one
           facet of delay. If the plaintiff stood by knowingly and let the
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 21 of 46
            defendants build up an important trade until it had become
           necessary to crush it, then the plaintiffs would be stopped by
           their acquiescence. If the acquiescence in the infringement
           amounts to consent, it will be a complete defence as was laid
           down in Mouson (J.G.) & Co. v. Boehm [(1884) 26 Ch D 406] .
           The acquiescence must be such as to lead to the inference of a
           licence sufficient to create a new right in the defendant as was
           laid down in Rodgers v. Nowill.
           27. The law of acquiescence is stated by Cotton, L.J.
           in Proctor v. Bannis [(1887) 36 Ch D 740] as under:
           "It is necessary that the person who alleges this lying by should
           have been acting in ignorance of the title of the other man, and
           that the other man should have known that ignorance and not
           mentioned his own title."
            In the same case Bowen, L.J. said:
           "In order to make out such acquiescence it is necessary to
           establish that the plaintiff stood by and knowingly allowed the
           defendants to proceed and to expend money in ignorance of the
           fact that he had rights and means to assert such rights."
           28. In Devidoss and Co. [AIR 1941 Mad 31 : (1940) 2 MLJ
           793: ILR 1941 Mad 300] at pages 33 and 34 the law is stated
           thus:
           "To support a plea of acquiescence in a trade mark case it must
           be shown that the plaintiff has stood by for a substantial period
           and thus encouraged the defendant to expend money in building
           up a business associated with the mark. In Rowland v. Michell
           [(1896) 13 RPC 464] Romer J. observed:
           'If the plaintiff really does stand by and allow a man to carry
           on business in the manner complained of to acquire a
           reputation and to expend money he cannot then after a long
           lapse of time, turn round and say that the business ought to be
           stopped.'"

             In the same case, but on appeal Lord Russel, C.J. said
           [Rowland v. Michell, (1897) 14 RPC 37, 43] at p. 43:
           "Is the plaintiff disentitled to relief under that head by
           injunction because of acquiescence? Of course it is involved in
           the consideration of that that the plaintiff has a right against
           the defendant and that the defendant has done him a wrong and
           the question is whether the plaintiff has so acted as to disentitle
           him from asserting his right and from seeking redress from the
           wrong which has been done to him. Cases may occasionally lay
           down principles and so forth which are a guide to the court, but
           each case depends upon its own circumstances.
               Dealing with the question of standing by in Codes v. Addis
           and Son [(1923) 40 RPC 130, 142] at p. 142, Eve, J. said:
           'For the purpose of determining this issue I must assume that
           the plaintiffs are traders who have started in this more or less
           small way in this country, and have been continuously carrying
           on this business. But I must assume also that they have not,
           during that period, been adopting a sort of Rip Van Winkle
           policy of going to sleep and not watching what their rivals and
           competitors in the same line of business were doing. I accept
           the evidence of any gentleman who comes into the box and
           gives his evidence in a way which satisfies me that he is
           speaking the truth when he says that he individually did not
           know of the existence of a particular element or a particular
           factor in the goods marketed by his opponents. But the question
           is a wider question than that : ought not he to have known : is
           he entitled to shut his eyes to everything that is going on around
           him, and then when his rivals have perhaps built a very
           important trade by the user of indicia which he might have
           prevented their using had he moved in time, come to the Court
           and say: "Now stop them from doing it further, because a
           moment of time has arrived when I have awakened to the fact
           that this is calculated to infringe my rights." Certainly not. He
           is bound, like everybody else who wishes to stop that which he
           says is an invasion of his rights, to adopt a position of
           aggression at once, and insist, as soon as the matter is brought
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009             Page 23 of 46
            to Court, it ought to have come to his attention, to take steps to
           prevent its continuance; it would be an insufferable injustice
           were the Court to allow a man to lie by while his competitors
           are building up an important industry and then to come
           forward, so soon as the importance of the industry has been
           brought home to his mind, and endeavour to take from them
           that of which they had legitimately made use; every day when
           they used it satisfying them more and more that there was no
           one who either could or would complain of their so doing. The
           position might be altogether altered had the user of the factor
           or the element in question been of a secretive or surreptitious
           nature; but when a man is openly using, as part of his business,
           names and phrases, or other elements, which persons in the
           same trade would be entitled, if they took steps, to stop him
           from using, he gets in time a right to sue them which prevents
           those who could have stopped him at one time from asserting at
           a later stage their right to an injunction.'
           In Mc. Caw Stevenson & Orr Ltd. v. Lee Bros. [(1960) 23 RPC
           1] acquiescence for four years was held to be sufficient to
           preclude the plaintiff from succeeding. In 1897 the plaintiffs in
           that case registered the word 'glacier' as a trade mark in
           respect of transparent paper as a substitute for stained glass.
           As the result of user the word had become identified with the
           plaintiffs' goods. In 1900 the defendants commenced to sell
           similar goods under the name 'glazine.' In 1905 the plaintiffs
           commenced an action for infringement. The defendants denied
           that the use of the word 'glazine' was calculated to deceive and
           also pleaded acquiescence. A director of the plaintiff company
           admitted that he had known of the use of the word 'glazine' by
           the defendants for four years -- he would not say it was not five
           years. It was held that the plaintiffs failed on the merits and by
           reason of their delay in bringing the action.
                Delay simpliciter may be no defence to a suit for
           infringement of a trade mark, but the decisions to which I have
           referred to clearly indicate that where a trader allows a rival
           trader to expend money over a considerable period in the
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009            Page 24 of 46
            building up of a business with the aid of a mark similar to his
           own he will not be allowed to stop his rival's business. If he
           were permitted to do so great loss would be caused not only to
           the rival trader but to those who depend on his business for
           their livelihood. A village may develop into a large town as the
           result of the building up of a business and most of the
           inhabitants may be dependent on the business. No hard and fast
           rule can be laid down for deciding when a person has, as the
           result of inaction, lost the right of stopping another using his
           mark. As pointed out in Rowland v. Michell [Rowland v.
           Michell, (1897) 14 RPC 37, 43] each case must depend on its
           own circumstances, but obviously a person cannot be allowed
           to stand by indefinitely without suffering the consequence."
           29. This is the legal position. Again in Halsbury's Laws of
           England, Fourth Edn., Vol. 24 at paragraph 943 it is stated
           thus:
           "943. Acquiescence.-- An injunction may be refused on the
           ground of the plaintiff's acquiescence in the defendant's
           infringement of his right. The principles on which the court will
           refuse interlocutory or final relief on this ground are the same,
           but a stronger case is required to support a refusal to grant
           final relief at the hearing. [Patching v. Dubbins [(1853) Kay 1:
           69 ER 1] ; Child v. Douglas [(1854) 5 De GM&G 739: 43 ER
           1057] ; Johnson v. Wyatt [(1863) 2 De GJ&Sm 18: 46 ER
           281]; Turner v. Mirfield [(1865) 34 Beav 390: 55 ER
           685]; Hogg v. Scott [(1874) LR 18 Eq 444]; Price v. Bala and
           Festiniog Rly. Co. [(1884) 50 LT 787]] The reason is that at the
           hearing of the cause it is the court's duty to decide upon the
           rights of the parties, and the dismissal of the action on the
           ground of acquiescence amounts to a decision that a right
           which once existed is absolutely and for ever
           lost: Johnson v. Wyatt [(1863) 2 De GJ&Sm 18 : 46 ER 281] at
           25; and see Gordonv. Cheltenham and Great Western Union

           Langdale MR."

            30. In Aktiebolaget Manus v. R.J. Fullwood & Bland,
           LD. [(1948) 55 RPC 329, 338] at pp. 338-39 it was held thus:
           "Apart from this point the case of Fullwood v.Fullwood [(1878)
           9 Ch D 176 : 47 LJ Ch 459] shows that the injunction in a
           passing-off case is an injunction sought in aid of a legal right,
           and that the Court is bound to grant it if the legal right be
           established unless the delay be such that the Statute of
           Limitations would be a bar. That case apparently concerned
           some predecessors of the defendants. The delay was one of
           rather under two years and the relief sought was an injunction
           to restrain the use by the defendants of cards and wrappers
           calculated to induce the belief that his business was connected
           with the plaintiff. Fry, J., in the course of his judgment said
           this:
                'Now, assuming, as I will, for the purpose "of my decision,
           that in the early part of 1875 the plaintiff knew of all the
           material facts" which have been brought before me today, he
           commenced his action in November 1876. "In my opinion that
           delay, and it is simply delay, is not sufficient to deprive the
           plaintiff of" his rights. The right asserted by the plaintiff in this
           action is a legal right. He is, in "effect, asserting that the
           defendants are liable to an action for deceit". It is not
           suggested in the defence that the delay here involves a question
           under or analogous to the period under the Statute. The
           defendants did suggest that there had been something more
           than mere delay on the part of the plaintiffs, and that the
           plaintiffs had lain by and allowed the goodwill which the
           plaintiffs now propose to acquire, but this point was not
           seriously pressed. It was suggested that Mr Evans Bajker, the
           plaintiffs' solicitor, knew from 1941 onwards what the
           defendants were doing, but it is impossible to impute to a busy
           solicitor a knowledge which he could only acquire by seeing
           advertisements in local or farming papers advertising the
           defendants' activities. No direct information was afforded to
           him; on the contrary it will be remembered that when in 1942
           he made enquiries on behalf of his clients information was
    CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009               Page 26 of 46
            studiously withheld from him. I conclude therefore that there
           has been no acquiescence to disentitle the plaintiff to relief.'"
           31. In Electrolux LD. v. Electrix [1954 RPC 23, 34] at pp. 32
           and 33 it was held thus:
           "I now pass to the second question, that of acquiescence, and I
           confess at once that upon this matter I have felt no little
           sympathy for the defendants, and have been not a little envious
           of the good fortune which has attended the plaintiffs, though no
           doubt they may justly attribute it to the astuteness of their
           advisers; but, as has already been said, the defendants have
           traded openly and (as the Judge found) honestly, beyond any
           question, in the ordinary course and substantially under this
           name 'Electrix' for a very long period of time, since early
           1930's. During that time, they have built up (I doubt not) a
           valuable goodwill associated with that name. If the possibility
           that the mark 'Electrolux' was infringed is out of the way, and
           if I disregard for the moment (as I do) the point taken by Mr
           Kenneth Johnstone that in any event for use of 'Electrolux' was
           a sufficient use for the purpose of Section 26(1) of 'Electrux'
           (seeing that the two marks were associated). I have no doubt
           that if the plaintiff had challenged in the courts the right of the
           defendants to use 'Electrix' before they have effect to their
           decision to apply the word 'Electrux' to their cheaper model in
           lieu of 'Electrolux', they would in all probability have failed,
           because the defendants' motion to strike the word 'Electrux' off
           the Register would have succeeded, but the fact is that when the
           battle was joined, 'Electrux' was no longer vulnerable on that
           account, unless the defendants can establish that the use was
           not bona fide, a matter to which I shall come presently. It is,
           however, said that by the defendants that the plaintiffs have
           deprived themselves of their legal right or, at least, of any right
           to the equitable remedy of injunction.
               Upon this matter, a great deal of learning has been referred
           to, and we have also had our attention drawn to a number of
           cases. The latter include the well-known statement
           in Willmott v. Barber [(1880) 15 Ch D 96 : 43 LT 95] by Fry, J.
CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 27 of 46
(as he then was) at p. 105. He said this: 'It has been said that the
acquiescence which' will deprive a man of his legal rights must amount to
fraud, and in my view that is an abbreviated statement of a very true
proposition. A man is not to be deprived of his legal rights unless he has
acted in such a way as would 'make it fraudulent for him to set up those
rights'. Let me pause here to say that I do not understand that, by the word
'fraudulent', the learned Judge was thereby indicating conduct which would
amount to a common law tort of deceit. 'What, then, are the elements or
requisites necessary to constitute fraud of that description?' In the first
place 'the plaintiff must have made a mistake as to his legal rights'.
Secondly, the plaintiff must 'have expended some money or must have done some
act (not necessarily upon the defendant's land) on the faith of his mistaken
belief'. Thirdly, the defendant, the possessor of 'the legal right, must know
of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with 'the legal right,
must know of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with' the
right claimed by the plaintiff. If he does not know of it he is in the same
position 'as the plaintiff, and the doctrine of acquiescence is founded upon
conduct with a knowledge' of your legal rights. Fourthly, the defendant, the
possessor of the legal right, must know 'of the plaintiff's mistaken belief of
his rights. If he does not, there is nothing which' calls upon him to assert
his own rights. Lastly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal 'right, must
have encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money or in the other acts
which he has done, either directly or by abstaining from asserting his legal
right'. In reading that passage, it is perhaps necessary to note (because it
makes it at first sight a little more difficult to follow) that the positions
of plaintiff and defendant as they are usually met with are there transposed,
and that one of the parties who is there spoken of as the plaintiff
corresponds with the present case with the defendants, and vice versa."
32\. Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satyadeo Gupta [(1963) 2 SCR 484 : AIR 1963 SC

in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 28 of 46 with approval. However, on the facts of that
case it was held that the plea of acquiescence had not been made out."

> (Del)] , injunction was granted despite delay, stating:
> "Where infringement is deliberate and wilful and the defendant acts

> 31\. It would appear to me that where there is an honest concurrent user by

> 52\. In Mc Donald's Corpn. v. Sterling's Mac Fast Food [ILR 2007 Kant 3346]
> the Karnataka High Court held:
> "9. Though the plaintiff adopted its registered trade mark big mac in 1968
> in USA, in Para 7 of memorandum of appeal it is stated as under: '7. The
> first appellant is the proprietor in India of other McFamily trade marks
> having prefix or suffix Mc/Mac and it has also applied for registration and
> most of them were registered CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS)
> 210/2009 Page 34 of 46 during the pendency of the suit and the trade marks
> are used in India since October 1996.' From the above, it is clear that the
> plaintiffs are using their trade marks in India since October 1996\.
> However, in the very next paragraph it is stated as under:
> '8. The first appellant was given approval on 15- 2-1993 by the Government
> of India to operate a chain of restaurants in India. The second appellant
> was incorporated and registered with the Registrar of Companies on 30-8-1993

> carrying on with its business since 1983. Having started business by the

> 14.6. Thus if a plaintiff stands by ignoring the use of the mark by the
> defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to the relief of injunction
> due to the acquiescence by the plaintiff. In the present case, plaintiff
> permitted defendant to use part of the logo i.e. triangle depicting the
> mountain with the clouds when plaintiff was a part of defendant No.1.
14.7. As the plaintiff was also the user of the artistic work with the
defendant No.1, he cannot be said to have acquiesced in the use of the
artistic work i.e. mountain depicted as a triangle with the clouds.
15\. Issue No.(v): Whether the suit is barred by limitation and laches?(OPD)
15.1. The two artistic works were being used by Himlayan Heli Services as a
joint venture of the defendant when plaintiff was also a part thereof. As
CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 35 of 46 per the
defendant disputes arose between the parties in the year 2006, the copyright
registration was granted in favour of plaintiff on 28 th January, 2008 and the
present suit had been instituted in the year 2009. Thus, it cannot be held
that the suit is barred by delay and laches. 15.2. Thus issue No.(v) is
decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.
16\. Issue No. (i): Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction
to restrain the Defendant from using the artistic work 'HIMALAYAN HELI
SERVICES'?(OPP) 16.1. Contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff is that
the plaintiff being the owner of the two artistic works which fact has been
proved by the plaintiff by leading evidence and through the admission of the
defendant the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of injunction against the
defendant. Learned counsel for the defendant on the other hand contends that
the two logos were designed by the defendant and plaintiff has never used the
same and it has always been using the logo of a mountain with triangle with
the ski trail and the clouds. Hence despite there being registration in favour
the plaintiff, the defendant having acquired goodwill in the same, the
plaintiff cannot seek an injunction. In view of suppression of material facts,
false statements on oath and also by virtue of acquiescence of the plaintiff,
no relief be granted.
16.2. As noted above this Court has already held that the plaintiff has no
copyright in the artistic works for which he has been granted registration
vide registration Nos.A-81931/2008 and A-81932/2008 hence he is not entitled
to any injunction qua the said copyrights.
CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 36 of 46
16.3. Further the relief of injunction is a discretionary relief, and a person
who suppresses material facts would not be entitled to the same as held in
(2006) 7 SCC 756 Jai Narain Parasrampuria v. Pushpa Devi Saraf:
> "Discretionary relief
> 84\. Both the parties hereto are guilty of serious misconduct. Both of them
> have abused the process of court. They initiated unnecessary nay frivolous
> proceedings against each other. Both the parties took recourse to abuse of
> judicial process against the other upon suppression of material fact, which
> would amount to fraud on court. The question in regard to exercise of
> discretionary jurisdiction for grant of a decree of specific performance of
> contract, as envisaged under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, must be
> considered from the said angle.
> 86\. Balancing of equities in a case of this nature is a difficult task. It
> is now well settled that compensation can be awarded in lieu of grant of
> decree of specific performance of contract. The courts are now evolving
> separate principles in regard to the remedy of compensation. (See Snells'
> Equity, p. 452.) The learned author cites various cases to make home the
> point stating:
> "18-17. A monetary award which is made in substitution for (or in addition
> to) non-monetary relief will frequently be determined on the basis of
> pecuniary performance or pecuniary rescission; but, in some cases, may also
> be determined by reference to the loss which has been suffered.
> 18-18. (a) Pecuniary performance.--Pecuniary performance is a money
> substitute for the thing which the defendant would have been required to do,
> had specific relief been ordered. It is to be determined by identifying the
> difference between two values: (i) the value of the claimant's right to
> performance of the obligation, and (ii) the value of the performance which
> the defendant is able CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009
> Page 37 of 46 to give. Where the defendant is not able to perform the
> obligation, the amount of the award will represent the value of the
> claimant's right to performance: in such a case, an order for pecuniary
> performance will be for a sum corresponding with the value of the claimant's
> right to performance. The position is similar where the court declines to
> grant non-monetary relief and thereby (in effect) releases the defendant
> from the need to perform the obligation in the future."
> 87\. In Spry's Equitable Remedies, it is stated:
> "In considering what circumstances induce the court, as a matter of
> discretion, to award equitable damages rather than relief in specie it must
> be borne in mind that when once the general conditions for the exercise of
> equitable jurisdiction have been established, that is, the inappropriateness
> of damages in respect of a matter coming within a recognised head of relief,
> prima facie there arises a right to specific performance or to an
> injunction, as the case may require. So it was observed by Lord Langdale, 'I
> conceive the doctrine of the court to be this, that the court exercises a
> discretion, in cases of specific performance, and directs a specific
> performance unless it should be what is called highly unreasonable to do
> so'. Similarly reference has been made to 'the rule that where the plaintiff
> has established the invasion of a common law right, and there is ground for
> believing that without an injunction there is likely to be a repletion of
> the wrong, he is, in the absence of special circumstances, entitled to an
> injunction against such repetition'.
> On the one hand it is clear that the passage of provisions for equitable
> damages did not affect these general principles. So it has been affirmed
> that the authorities show 'that Lord Cairns' Act did not revolutionise the
> principles upon which the equitable jurisdiction had been administered up to
> that time and that some special case must be shown before the court should
> exercise the jurisdiction under the Act'. On the other hand, in cases where
> an injunction or an order of CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS)
> 210/2009 Page 38 of 46 specific performance would be granted if there were

> to the plaintiff if he were obliged to accept merely an award of damages
> would be so far outweighed by the hardship that would be caused to the
> defendant if specific enforcement were granted that damages constitute the
> most appropriate remedy. Hence where the court would otherwise have granted
> specific relief the importance of a power to grant equitable damages is
> found to lie primarily in its relation to considerations of hardship between
> the parties and to the balance of convenience."
> 88\. In Gillett [(2000) 2 All ER 289 : (2000) 3 WLR 815 (CA)] it was pointed
> out: (All ER p. 311 b-c) "Since Mr Gillett has established his claim to
> equitable relief, this Court must decide what is the most appropriate form
> for the relief to take. The aim is (as Sir Arthur Hobhouse said in Plimmer
> v. Mayor of Wellington [(1884) 9 AC 699 (PC)] ) to 'look at the

16.4. Even in the decision reported 2011 (9) SCC 147 Citadel Fine
Pharmaceuticals vs. Ramaniyam Real Estate (P) Ltd., Supreme Court CS(OS)
205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 41 of 46 clarified that
the plaintiff will not be entitled to discretionary relief because of
concealment and held:
> "57. There is another aspect of the matter also. In the instant case by
> asking for specific performance of the contract, the plaintiff purchaser is
> praying for a discretionary remedy. It is axiomatic that when a
> discretionary remedy is prayed for by a party, such party must come to court
> on proper disclosure of facts. The plaint which it filed before the court in

> 10,00,000 with interest at the rate of 24% from the date of payment of the
> said amount till the realisation and an alternative prayer to that effect
> was also made in the prayer clause (c).
> 58\. However, the fact remains that prior to the filing of the suit the
> defendant vendor returned the said amount of Rs 10,00,000 by its letter
> dated 4-9-1996 by an account payee cheque in favour of the plaintiff and the

> is suppression of a material fact, and disentitles the plaintiff purchaser
> from getting any discretionary relief of specific performance by the court.
> 59\. In this connection we may refer to the Principle of Equitable Remedies
> by I.C.F. Spry, (4th Edn., Sweet & Maxwell, 1990). Dealing with the question
> of "clean hands" the learned author opined that where the plaintiff is shown
> to have materially misled the court or to have abused its process, or to
> have attempted to do so, the discretionary relief of specific performance
> can be denied to him. In laying down this principle, the learned author
> relied on a decision of the English Court in Armstrong v. Sheppard & Short
> Ltd. [(1959) CS(OS) 205/2009 & Crl.M.A.5011/2009 in CS(OS) 210/2009 Page 42
> of 46 2 QB 384 : (1959) 3 WLR 84 : (1959) 2 All ER 651 (CA)] , QB at p. 397.
> (See Spry, Equitable Remedies, p. 243.)
> 60\. This Court has also taken the same view in Arunima Baruah v. Union of
> India [(2007) 6 SCC 120] . At p. 125, para 12 of the Report, this Court held
> that it is trite law that to enable the court to refuse to exercise its
> discretionary jurisdiction suppression must be of a material fact. This
> Court, of course, held that what is a material fact, suppression whereof
> would disentitle the suitor to obtain a discretionary relief, would depend
> upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, by way of guidance
> this Court held that a material fact would mean that fact which is material
> for the purpose of determination of the lis.
> 61\. Following the aforesaid tests, this Court is of the opinion that the
> suppression of the fact that the plaintiff refused to accept the cheque of
> Rs 10 lakhs sent to it by the defendant under registered post with
> acknowledgment due in terms of Clause 9 of the contract is a material fact.
> So on that ground the plaintiff purchaser is not entitled to any relief in
> its suit for specific performance."
16.5. In view of the plaintiff not having been able to prove that he is the
creator/ owner in the two marks as a whole and due to the suppression of
material facts by the plaintiff, this Court finds that no relief of injunction
can be granted in favour of the plaintiff.
16.6. Thus issue No.(i) is also decided against the plaintiff and in favour of
the defendant.
17\. Relief:
17.1. From the discussion as aforesaid, the plaintiff is neither entitled to
the relief of injunction, nor damages nor delivery of the infringing material
to the plaintiff. The suit is accordingly dismissed.

2\. It is trite law that even if the suit is dismissed for concealment of
fact, the Court is not bound to mandatorily take action under Section 340
Cr.P.C. Court would be required to take action only when there is gross abuse
of the process of law and it is expedient in the interest of justice. In the
decision reported as 1998 (12) ACR 50 Syed Asadullah Kazmi Vs. Additional
Magistrate D.D.C., the Allahabad High Court held:
> "10. Applying these elementary rules of interpretation to the provisions of
> Section 340 of the Code, it is evident that the legislature has couched the

> of justice that an enquiry should be made. As an inescapable corollary, in
> case it is not 'expedient', under the circumstances, enquiry must not be

> adjective according to grammar . This obviously connotes suitable or
> advisable. This word is also used as noun and means that which serves to

> 'desirableness'. The power of the Court in directing an enquiry to be made
