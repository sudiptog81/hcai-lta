Per Shri A.K. Garodia, Accountant Member These are cross appeals filed by the
assessee and revenue and these are directed against the order of ld.
CIT(A)-IV, Bangalore dated 18.08.2014 for Assessment Year 2009-10.
2\. The grounds raised by the assessee are as under.
"Based on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law.
IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 2 of 12 Manhattan Associates India)
Development Centre Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "MA India' or the
Company- or the "Appellant'), respectfully craves leave to prefer an appeal
against the appeal order passed by the learned Commissioner of Income-Tax
(Appeals) - IV [hereinafter referred to as the "learned CIT(A)"] under section
250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ("Act") on the following grounds:
On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law:
1\. The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and facts, by upholding the addition
of Rs. 8,58,68,414 made by the learned Assessing Officer ("AO") / Transfer
Pricing Officer ("TPO") on account of adjustment to the arm's length price of
the payments made by the Appellant to its Associated Enterprise ("AE") towards
software development services:
a) The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and facts by not accepting the
Appellant's plea in entirety and confirming with the learned Assessing Officer
("AO")/Transfer Pricing Officer ("TPO") on not accepting the economic analysis
undertaken by the Appellant in accordance with the provisions of the Act read
with the Income-tax Rules, 1962 ("Rules"), and conducting a fresh economic
analysis for the determination of the arm's length price in connection with
the impugned international transaction and holding that the Appellant's
international transaction is not at arm's length;
b) The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and facts by upholding the action of
AO/ TPO in determination of the arm's length margin/ price using only single
year data i.e. for FY 2008-09 and not allowing the use of multiple year data
as applied by the Appellant in the transfer pricing documentation;
c) The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and facts by upholding the action of
AOITPO in rejecting certain comparables considered by the Appellant in the
comparability analysis by applying different quantitative and qualitative
filters:
i. The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and in facts, by not accepting the
Appellant's plea that companies having different accounting year (i.e.
companies having accounting year other than March 31 or companies whose
financial statements were for a period other than 12 months) should not be
rejected.
ii. The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and in facts, by not accepting the
Appellant's plea that companies should not be rejected using employee cost
greater than 25% of the total revenues as a comparability criterion.
iii. The learned CIT(A) has erred. in law and in facts, by not accepting the
Appellant's plea that rejecting companies using IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 &
1342/Bang/2014  Page 3 of 12 export sales less than 75% of the operating
revenues as a comparability criterion in respect of the software development
services transaction, is not appropriate.
iv. The learned CIT(A) has erred in law and in facts, by not accepting the
Appellant's plea that in case of certain comparable companies consolidated
results can be used for analysis. The Appellant had considered the
consolidated results in only those cases where the income of the Indian
company constituted more than 75% of the consolidated company-wide/ segmental
revenues.
d) The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and in facts, by upholding the action
of AO/TPO in accepting/ rejecting certain comparable companies based on
unreasonable comparability criteria.
e) The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and facts, by considering incorrect
receivables and payables in computing the working capital adjustment and
further erred, by upholding the action of the AO/TPO in restricting the
benefit on account of working capital adjustment to 1.71 percent.
f) The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and facts, by not making suitable
adjustments to account for differences in the risk profile of the Appellant
vis-Ã -vis the comparables and concluding that once the working capital
adjustment is granted, there is no necessity of providing any further
adjustments.;
g) The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and facts by, ignoring the fact that
the Appellant is availing tax holiday under section 10A of the Act, and there
is no motive/ reason to shift the profits out of India, which is one of the
basic intention of the introducing the transfer pricing provisions.
2\. The learned CIT (A) has erred, in law and facts, in computing the ALP
without giving benefit of +/-5 percent under the proviso to section 92C (2) of
the Act;
3\. The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and facts, in confirming the
imposition of interest under Sections 234B of the Act by the learned AO.
4\. The learned CIT(A) has erred, in law and facts, in upholding initiation of
penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(c) of the Act by the learned AO.
The Appellant submits that each of the above grounds is independent and
without prejudice to one another.
The Appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend, vary, omit or IT(TP)A Nos.
1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 4 of 12 substitute any of the aforesaid grounds of
appeal at any time before or at the time of hearing of the appeal, so as to
enable the Hon'ble Tribunal to decide on the appeal in accordance with the
law."
3\. The assessee has also raised some additional grounds which are as under.

> following comparables selected by the learned TPO. The appellant further
> prays that there is no Estoppel in law against pointing out a mistake in the

4\. The grounds raised by the revenue are as under.
> "1. The order of the learned CIT(A) is opposed to law and facts of the case.
> 2\. "Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the CIT(A)
> was justified in law in holding that expenses incurred in foreign currency
> being traveling expenses of Rs.4,73,20,263/-, is to be excluded from both
> the export turnover and the total turnover for the purpose of computation of
> deduction u/s 10A of the Act whereas such exclusion is permitted to arrive
> at the export turnover only as pet the definitions given in Sec.10A of the
> Act and total turnover has not been defined in the Section".
> 3\. In the facts and circumstances of the case the learned CIT(A) erred in
> holding that foreign exchange loss/gain is operating in nature when such
> loss/gain that is attributable to the operating activity is not derived from
> the operating activity.
> 4\. The Ld. CIT(A) erred in law in directing to include forex gain/loss as
> part of operating income/loss without ascertaining the nexus with the
> business activity of the taxpayer.
> 5\. The Ld.CIT(A) erred in concluding that forex gain/loss are to be treated
> as operating in nature as while they may be incidental but cannot be deemed
> as operating in nature since, they are not critical to operational
> activities of the business conducted by the taxpayer.
> 6\. For these and other grounds that may be urged at the time of hearing, it

> 5\. It was submitted by ld. AR of assessee that assessee has submitted a big

> exclusion of five comparables i.e. 1) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., 2) Infosys
> Technologies Ltd., 3) Persistent Systems Ltd., 4) Tata Elxsi Ltd. and 5)

> 5th company i.e. Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd., the assessee's request is on

> ITO in IT(TP)A No. 108/Bang/2014 dated 12.12.2014, copy available on pages 1
> to 32 of paper book-II filed by the assessee. He also pointed out that this

> i.e. software development support services. He submitted that by following
> this Tribunal order, these five companies should be excluded from the final
> list of comparables. The ld. DR of revenue supported the order of CIT(A).
6\. We have considered the rival submissions. First of all, we consider the
applicability of this Tribunal order cited before us i.e. rendered in the case
of Yodlee Infotech Pvt. Ltd. vs. ITO (supra). We find that in the present
case, as per the order of TPO, business profile of Assessee Company has been
noted on page no. 2 of the order of TPO in which it is stated that the
assessee company provides software development services to its AE in US on a
cost plus 15 percent markup basis. In the case of Yodlee Infotech Pvt. Ltd.
vs. ITO (supra), it is noted by the Tribunal on page no. 2 of this Tribunal
order that the assessee company in that case is primarily engaged in the
provision of software development support services to its AE in US and hence,
it is seen that the business profile of the present assessee and that company
i.e. Yodlee IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 7 of 12 Infotech Pvt.
Ltd. is similar and therefore, in our considered opinion, this Tribunal order
cited before us is applicable in the present case. Thereafter we find that in
that case, the TPO considered 11 comparables including these five companies
for which the assessee is requesting for exclusion in the present case. In
para no. 21 of this Tribunal order available on page no. 25 of paper book, it
is noted by the Tribunal regarding M/s. Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. that ld. DR
has not rebutted the argument of the assessee that it was software product
company and functionally different from the assessee which was into software
development services and after considering another Tribunal order rendered in
the case of M/s. Cisco System Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in ITA No. 271/Bang/2014
dated 14.08.2014, the Tribunal directed in that case for exclusion of M/s.
Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. on this basis that this company is functionally
different.
7\. Similarly regarding M/s. Infosys Technologies Ltd., it was held by the
Tribunal on page no. 24 of that Tribunal order that M/s. Infosys Technologies
Ltd. had considerable intangibles like IPR and was into software product
development.
8\. Regarding M/s. Persistent Systems Ltd., it was noted on the same page i.e.
24 of that Tribunal order that regarding this company, it was held by Tribunal
in the case of 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT (TP) A No.
1303/Bang/2012 dated 28.11.2013 that this company was into product designing
services and into software product development.
9\. Regarding M/s. Tata Elxsi Ltd. also, it was held by the Tribunal on page
24 that Tata Elxsi Ltd. was developing niche products and into product
designing services and hence, on this basis, it was held that all these three
companies viz., M/s. Infosys Technologies Ltd., M/s. Persistent Systems Ltd.
and M/s. Tata Elxsi Ltd. should be excluded from the final list of comparables
being functionally different. Respectfully following this Tribunal order, we
hold that in the present case also, these four companies i.e. M/s. Bodhtree
Consulting Ltd., M/s. Infosys Technologies Ltd., M/s. Persistent Systems Ltd.
and M/s. Tata Elxsi Ltd. should be excluded from the final list of
comparables.
IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 8 of 12
10\. Regarding the remaining 5th comparable i.e. M/s. Larsen & Toubro Infotech
Ltd., the assessee's request for exclusion of this company is on this basis
that this company is having high turnover which is more than 10 times of
assessee company's turnover because the turnover of that company is Rs. 1950
Crores whereas the turnover of assessee company is Rs. 104.82 Crores. In this
regard, this Tribunal is now following the judgement of Hon'ble Delhi High
Court rendered in the case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) (P.)
Ltd. vs. DCIT as reported in 376 ITR 183 wherein it was held that huge profit
or huge turnover, ipso facto does not lead to the exclusion of a comparable
and the TPO, first, has to be satisfied that such differences do not
materially affect the price or cost and secondly, an attempt is to be made for
making reasonable adjustment to eliminate the material effect of such
differences. Respectfully following this judgement of Hon'ble Delhi High
Court, we restore the matter back to the file of TPO regarding the exclusion
of this company in the light of this judgement of Hon'ble Delhi High Court
rendered in the case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) (P.)Ltd. vs.
DCIT (supra) after providing adequate opportunity of being heard to the
assessee. In this manner, the assessee's request regarding the exclusion of
five comparables stands decided as per above paras.
11\. The remaining grounds of the assessee's appeal are regarding treating
various expenditure as non-operating while computing the margins of comparable
companies i.e.
a) Foreign exchange gain / loss
b) Provision for bad and doubtful debts / advances
c) Depreciation In this regard, this Tribunal is taking a consistent view that
even if an expenditure/income is of operating nature, it has to be seen as to
whether the same can be considered for T.P. analysis because even if an
expenditure / income is of operating nature, it has to be seen as to whether
the same can be considered for the purpose of TP analysis. In TP analysis by
using TNMM as MAM, profit percentage of the tested party and the comparable
companies are compared and therefore, it has to be seen that the expenses /
incomes in IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 9 of 12 dispute can be
considered for this purpose. Regarding the foreign exchange gain / loss it has
to be seen whether such gain / loss is in respect of the turnover of the
present year and if that is so, it can be considered because the corresponding
turnover is being considered for working out the profit percentage of the
tested party or comparable as the case may be. But if the foreign exchange
gain / loss is in respect of earlier year's turnover then such foreign
exchange gain / loss cannot be considered for TP analysis because the
corresponding turnover is not forming part of the denominator to work out the
profit percentage. Similarly, in respect of provision for bad and doubtful
debts also, it has to be seen as to whether the same is in respect of turnover
of the present year or of the earlier year and for this item of expenditure
also, the same logic will apply and if such provision for bad and doubtful
debts is against turnover of the present year then it can be considered for TP
analysis and otherwise not. No material has been brought on record by ld. AR
of assessee that these two items i.e. foreign exchange gain / loss and
provision for bad and doubtful debts are in respect of the current year's
turnover and therefore, regarding these two items, we find no reason to
interfere in the order of CIT (A).
12\. Regarding depreciation, we find that in the case of M/s. Persistent
Systems Ltd., the AO has added depreciation in total cost. We have already
directed for exclusion of this comparable i.e. M/s. Persistent Systems Ltd.
from the final list of comparables and therefore, this issue does not survive
regarding this comparable company at least. In addition to that, depreciation
has been added in case of Zylog Systems Ltd. as per Annexure - B of TPO order
and after adding depreciation of Rs. 19,37,05,047/-, the operating cost has
been increased and operating profit has been reduced resulting into OP/OC of
7.81%. We fail to understand what is the request of the assessee as per ground
no. 7 (c) raised before us by way of additional grounds of appeal because
depreciation has been considered as operating cost by the AO in respect of
Zylog Systems Ltd. and also Persistent Systems Ltd. and the AO has not
considered the depreciation cost as non-operating cost while computing the
margins of comparable companies and therefore, this ground no. 7 (c) of
assessee's appeal is also rejected.
IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 10 of 12
13\. There is one more issue raised by the assessee as per ground no. 1 (e) as
per which this is the grievance of the assessee that CIT (A) has erred in law
and facts by considering incorrect receivables and payables in computing the
working capital adjustment and further erred by upholding the action of the
AO/TPO in restricting the benefit on account of working capital adjustment to
1.71 percent. On this issue, no argument was raised by ld. AR of assessee in
the course of hearing before us and therefore, we infer that this ground is
not pressed by ld. AR of assessee and accordingly, rejected as not pressed.
14\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee stands partly allowed in
the terms indicated above.
15\. Now we take up the appeal of the revenue. Ground no. 1 of the revenue's
appeal is general in nature and the issue involved in ground no. 2 is squarely
covered in favour of the assessee by the judgement of Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court rendered in the case of CIT vs. Tata Elxsi Ltd., 349 ITR 98 wherein it
was held that total turnover is sum total of export turnover and domestic
turnover and therefore, if an amount is reduced from export turnover then the
total turnover also goes down by the same amount automatically. The direction
of CIT (A) on this issue is in line with this judgment of Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court and therefore, on this issue, we find no infirmity in the order of
CIT (A) and hence, we decline to interfere in the order of CIT (A) on this
issue. Ground no. 2 is rejected.
16\. Regarding ground nos. 3 to 5, it was submitted by ld. DR of revenue that
on this aspect, the decision of CIT (A) is contained in para no. 10.5(v),
10.5.1 to 10.5.3 of his order. He submitted that even if the expenditure in
question are operating in nature, it has to be seen as to whether the same can
be considered for TP analysis because if such expenses on account of foreign
exchange gain / loss and provision for bad and doubtful debts etc. are in
respect of the earlier year's turnover then the same cannot be considered for
TP analysis because the corresponding turnover is not forming part of
denominator and from the order of CIT(A) on this issue, this is not coming out
that this aspect has been examined by him. He submitted that this issue may
IT(TP)A Nos. 1293 & 1342/Bang/2014  Page 11 of 12 be restored back to the file
of CIT(A) to examine this aspect of the matter. The ld. AR of assessee
supported the order of CIT(A).
17\. We have considered the rival submissions and we find force in the
submissions of ld. DR of revenue that the issue regarding inclusion of foreign
exchange gain / loss for the purpose of TP analysis has to be examined after
finding out whether such gain / loss is in respect of current year's turnover
or earlier year's turnover. Since there is no finding of authorities below on
this aspect, we feel it proper to restore this matter back to the file of TPO
for fresh decision with the direction that the assessee should furnish the
detail of corresponding turnover against which this foreign exchange gain /
loss and provision for bad and doubtful debts etc. has arisen and if it is
found that such gain / loss and provision for bad and doubtful debts are in
respect of current year's turnover then the same should be considered for TP
analysis in the hands of tested party and comparable both as the case may be
but if it is found that the same is related to turnover of earlier year then
the same should be ignored because in that situation, the corresponding
turnover is not forming part of denominator and therefore, the numerator also
cannot be increased or decreased. Accordingly ground nos. 3 to 5 of revenue's
appeal are allowed for statistical purposes.
18\. In the result, the appeal filed by the revenue stands partly allowed for
statistical purposes in the terms indicated above.
19\. In the combined result, both the appeals filed by the revenue and
assessee are partly allowed for statistical purposes in the terms indicated
