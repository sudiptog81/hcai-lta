              Dated this the 9th day of November, 2016
                               O R D E R
~~~~~~~~
1.The extraordinary inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, is sought to be invoked by the petitioners who are
the accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 in Crime No.206 of 2016 of the Palarivattom
Police Station to bring the criminal proceedings pending against them to a
premature termination. The aforesaid Crime was registered on the strength of a
complaint submitted by the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 before the Sub Inspector of
Police, Palarivattom Police Station. The petitioners face allegations of
having committed offences punishable Sections 406, 420 read with Section 34 of
the IPC.
Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -2-
2.The complaint which is jointly filed by respondent Nos. 2 and 3 against the
petitioners and one Raimol C. Babu has been produced as Annexure-A2. The
aforesaid Raimol C.Babu has not joined the petitioners in this petition.
3.Briefly stated , the facts necessary for the disposal of this petition may
be encapsulated as under:-
The respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are business men. The accused Nos.1 and 2 are the
father and mother respectively of the accused Nos. 3 to 5. The accused
approached the complainant in the month of October, 2012 and impressed upon
them that they are the owners of property having a total extent of 118 Ares
and offered to sell the said property. Negotiations were held in the office of
the petitioners, and the respondent Nos. 2 and 3, after perusing the
documents, got convinced about the title and possession of the petitioners
over the property. They were informed that the 2nd petitioner herein was the
Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -3- Power of Attorney Holder of the other petitioners
and was empowered to execute the deed for and on his behalf. Believing the
words of the petitioners, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 decided to purchase the
property for a consideration of Rs.4,10,000/- per cent. The petitioners
undertook to obtain necessary permits from the Nedumbassery Panchayat and also
the Airport authority for enabling the purchasers to carry out constructions
in the said property.
4.An agreement was consequently executed on 2.11.2012 and a sum of Rs.2.5
Crores was accepted by the petitioners towards part of sale consideration from
respondents 2 and 3. The period of agreement was fixed at 8 months.
Thereafter, on 1.3.2013, a further sum of Rs.1.5 Crores was accepted by way of
advance. However, it is alleged that the petitioners reneged from their
promise and did not act in terms of the express Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -4-
agreement. The money accepted towards advance was also not refunded.
5.Thereafter, on 1.7.2013, a supplementary agreement was executed, after much
deliberations between the parties. As per the supplementary agreement, the
parties decided to find out prospective buyers who were prepared to purchase
the property for a consideration of Rs.5 lakhs per cent and it was further
decided that the amount in excess of Rs.4,10,000/- per cent, received from the
prospective buyer would be shared between the parties. As per the
supplementary agreement, the period of original agreement was extended by a
period of eight more months.
6.After executing the supplementary agreement, a sum of Rs. 2 Crores was
handed over by the party respondents to the petitioners, which meant that a
total sum of Rs.6 Crores had changed hands. Though several Crl.M.C. No.1783 of
2016 -5- prospective buyers came forward to purchase the property in terms of
the supplementary agreement, the petitioners evaded giving one excuse or the
other. According to the complainant, the property could not be sold because of
the lapses of the petitioner. In the said circumstances, a legal notice was
issued by the respondents 2 and 3 to the petitioners on 2.5.2015 demanding the
refund of the advance amount. In reply, the petitioners issued a notice
cancelling the agreement for the reason that the lapses of the party
respondents were the cause of non performance of the terms of the agreement.
However, they agreed to refund 80% of the advance accepted in 50 installments.
According to the respondents 2 and 3, the acts of the petitioners would amount
to offence under Section 420 of the IPC.
7.I have heard Sri.P.Vijayabhanu, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the
petitioners, Sri.T.A.Shaji, the Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -6- learned Senior
counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 and the learned Public
Prosecutor.
8.Sri.P. Vijayabhanu , the learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner
urged that a perusal of Annexure-2 would reveal that the case essentially
involves a dispute of civil nature and the same should not be allowed to
become the subject matter of a criminal proceeding. Elaborating further, it
was submitted that the respondents 2 and 3 have already instituted O.S.No.35
of 2016 before the Sub Court, North Paravur praying for realizing a sum of
Rs.6,61,10,882/- from the defendants/petitioners herein and charged over the
property covered under the agreement. It is further urged that the property
has been attached by the Sub Court on the basis of an application filed by the
party respondents in the said suit. According to the learned counsel, the
allegations, even if the same is accepted as true did not disclose the offence
Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -7- under Section 420 or 406 of the IPC. A purely
commercial transaction has been given the cloak of a criminal offence in
disguise by the respondents 2 and 3 with the assistance of the police, is the
submission. Taking this Court through Annexure-A2 complaint, it is submitted
by the learned Senior counsel that in the absence of specific averments in the
complaint, where from the ingredients of the offence could be made out, the
Sub Inspector of Police ought not have registered the Crime. Referring to the
agreement and the supplementary agreement executed by the parties, it is
submitted that specific provisions are in the deed to enable the respondents 2
and 3 to realise the amount paid by way of advance by instituting appropriate
proceedings. Finally, it is submitted that the Complainant has failed to
comply with the directions issued by the Apex Court in Priyanka Srivastava and
Another V State of U.P. and Another [2015 (6) SCC 287] and on that sole
Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -8- ground the proceedings are to be terminated. The
learned Senior Counsel placed profuse reliance on a catena of decisions to
bring home the point that this is a fit case in which this Court would be
justified in invoking powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure .
9.Sri. T.A. Shaji, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondents 2
and 3, would refute the submissions and would contend that this Court, unless
manifest injustice is brought out, will ordinarily refuse to interfere at the
threshold stage. According to the learned Senior Counsel, an appraisal of the
complaint and the other materials on record and looking into the facts of the
case at this stage, it cannot be said that no offence is made out against the
petitioners. It is vehemently urged that the submissions made at the bar
relate to disputed questions of fact, which cannot be adjudicated upon by this
Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Placing reliance on various Crl.M.C. No.1783
of 2016 -9- precedents, it is submitted that at this stage only prima facie
case is to be seen to have been made out. Specifically referring to the
complaint, it is submitted that necessary allegations have been raised in the
complaint which shows the complicity of the petitioners and the mode in which
they had defrauded the respondents 2 and
3\. There is no reason warranting interference is the submission.
10.The learned Public Prosecutor endorse the submissions of respondents 2 and
3 and submitted that the power under Section 482 of the Code should be
exercised sparingly and with circumspection and no interference is warranted.
11.I have considered the rival submissions and have gone through the materials
on record.
12.Without adding or subtracting anything from the allegations in the
complaint, it can be seen that the whole Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -10- dispute
revolves around an agreement for sale executed between the feuding parties
involving a large extent of land. It is admitted in the complaint that the
party respondents are business men and that they had entered into the
agreement after satisfying themselves as regards the right and title of the
petitioners over the property. There is no dispute with regard to this aspect.
The agreement was entered into on 2.11.2012 and the terms have been reduced
into writing. The period mentioned in the agreement expired on 1.5.2013.
Towards part of sale consideration, a sum of Rs.4 Crores was also handed over.
However, according to the party respondents, the petitioners did not comply
with the terms and failed to execute the sale deed in terms of the agreement.
They also failed to return the money advanced. At that stage, the party
respondents did not have a case that the intention of the petitioner was to
deceive them. It is also Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -11- the admitted case of
the parties that a supplementary agreement was executed on 1.7.2013 by which
the parties decided to jointly find prospective purchasers for the property
who were willing to purchase the same for a price of Rs.5,00,000/- per cent
and it was agreed that the sale consideration in excess of Rs. 4,10,000/-
received from the prospective purchaser shall be shared equally. A sum of Rs.2
Crores was also paid by the party respondents to the petitioners at the time
of execution of the supplementary agreement. Though the respondents have a
specific case that several prospective purchasers had come forward to purchase
the property, according to them, due to the evasive attitude of the
petitioners, the transaction could not be sealed. Annexure A3 agreement
specifically provides that in the event of the petitioners failing to obtain
necessary permits, they shall return the entire money received from the
respondents 2 and 3 with Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -12- 12% interest. It is
admitted that O.S.No.35 of 2010 has been filed by the respondents 2 and 3
against the petitioners on 1.4.2016 praying for realizing a sum of
Rs.6,61,10,882/- together with interest from the petitioners charged on the
property covered under the agreement.
13.In order to attract the offence of cheating, essential ingredients of the
offence will have to be made out, which are, (i) cheating; (ii) dishonest
inducement to deliver property or to make, alter or destroy any valuable
security or anything which is sealed or signed or is capable of being
converted into a valuable security and (iii) mens rea of the accused at the
time of making the inducement. The making of a false representation is one of
the essential ingredients to constitute the offence of cheating under S.420
IPC. In order to bring a case for the offence of cheating, it is not merely
sufficient to prove that a false Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -13- representation
had been made, but, it is further necessary to prove that the representation
was false to the knowledge of the accused and was made in order to deceive the
complainant.
14.Distinction between mere breach of contract and cheating would depend upon
the intention of the accused at the time of alleged inducement. If it is
established that the intention of the accused was dishonest at the very time
when he made a promise and entered into a transaction with the complainant to
part with his property or money, then the liability is criminal and the
accused is guilty of the offence of cheating. On the other hand, if all that
is established is that a representation made by the accused has subsequently
not been kept, criminal liability cannot be foisted on the accused and the
only right which the complainant acquires is the remedy for breach of contract
in a Civil Court. Mere breach of contract cannot Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -14-
give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest
intention is shown at the beginning of the transaction. [ See ARCI V Nimra
Cerglass Technics ( P ) Ltd [2016 (1) SCC 348 ]
15.It is also plain that for constituting an offence of criminal breach of
trust, the following ingredients must be satisfied:
"(a) a person should have been entrusted with property, or entrusted with
dominion over property;
(b) that person should dishonestly misappropriate or convert to his own use
that property, or dishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully
suffer any other person to do so;
(c) that such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal should be in
violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is
to be discharged, or of Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -15- any legal contract which
the person has made, touching the discharge of such trust." (See: Asoke Basak
V State of Maharashtra [2010 (10 ) SCC 660 ].
16.In Murari Lal Gupta v. Gopi Singh [2005(13) SCC 699], the question was
whether the failure to honour an agreement for sale in spite of issuance of
three legal notices would amount to an offence under Section 406 and 420 of
the IPC. It was held as follows in paragraph No.6 of the judgment.
> "6..........Having taken into consideration all the material made available
> on record by the parties and after hearing the learned counsel for the
> parties, we are satisfied that the criminal proceedings initiated by the
> respondent against the petitioner are wholly unwarranted. The complaint is
> an abuse of the process of the court and the proceedings are, therefore,
> liable to be quashed. Even if all the averments made in the complaint are
> taken to be correct, yet the case for prosecution under S.420 or S.406 of
> the Penal Code is not made out. The complaint does not make any averment so
> as to infer any fraudulent or dishonest Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -16-
> inducement having been made by the petitioner pursuant to which the
> respondent parted with the money. It is not the case of the respondent that
> the petitioner does not have the property or that the petitioner was not
> competent to enter into an agreement to sell or could not have transferred
> title in the property to the respondent. Merely because an agreement to sell
> was entered into which agreement the petitioner failed to honour, it cannot
> be said that the petitioner has cheated the respondent. No case for
> prosecution under S.420 or S.406 IPC is made out even prima facie." (
> Emphasis supplied )
17.In Dalip Kaur and others V Jagnar Singh and Another [2009(14) SCC 696], an
identical issue came up for consideration before the Apex Court. The question
posed was whether a breach of a contract of an agreement for sale would
constitute an offence under section 406 or 420 of the IPC. It was observed as
follows :
> "The High Court, therefore, should have posed a question as to whether any
> act of inducement on the part of the appellant has been raised by the second
> respondent Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -17- and whether the appellant had an
> intention to cheat him from the very inception. If the dispute between the
> parties was essentially a civil dispute resulting from a breach of contract
> on the part of the appellants by non refunding the amount of advance the
> same would not constitute an offence of cheating. Similar is the legal
> position in respect of an offence of criminal breach of trust having regard
> to its definition contained in S.405 of the Indian Penal Code. (See -- Ajay
> Mitra v. State of M.P. [2003 (3) SCC 11]"
18.As regards the submission of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
party respondents that specific allegation has been raised in the complaint as
regards the offence of cheating, it will be apposite to refer to the judgment
of the Apex Court in In Anil Mahajan v. Bhor Industries Ltd., [2005 (10) SCC
228]. In the said case, the Supreme Court had occasion to hold that in a case
for quashing of the criminal complaint, the substance of the complaint is to
be seen. Mere use of the expression 'cheating' in the complaint is of no
consequence. Except Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -18- mention of the words
'deceive' and 'cheat' in the complaint filed before the Magistrate and
'cheating' in the complaint filed before the police, there is no averment
about the deceit, cheating or fraudulent intention of the accused at the time
of entering into the agreement where from it can be inferred that the accused
had the intention to deceive the complainant. Though it is true that the
petitioners had accepted a large sum of money towards part of sale
consideration, that alone, in the absence of the allegation in the complaint
will not attract the offence under Section 406 or 420 of the IPC.
19.After extensively going through the complaint and testing the same with the
binding precedents of the Apex Court, I have no doubt in my mind that the
entire complaint taken on a whole is indicative of a dispute which is purely
of a civil nature. The next question is as to whether the petitioners are
liable to face criminal proceeding in Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -19- pursuance
to the registration of the FIR.
20\. In Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd. [2006 (6) SCC 736], the Supreme
Court has held that in a dispute arising from breach of contract wherein civil
remedy has been availed by a party, the remedy in criminal law is not barred,
if the allegation discloses a criminal offence. However, it was held that a
purely civil dispute cannot be permitted to be converted into a criminal
offence. Referring to G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. [2000 (2) SCC 636], it
was held as follows :
> While on this issue, it is necessary to take notice of a growing tendency in
> business circles to convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases. This
> is obviously on account of a prevalent impression that civil law remedies
> are time consuming and do not adequately protect the interests of lenders /
> creditors. Such a tendency is seen in several family disputes also, leading
> to irretrievable breakdown of marriages / families. There is also an
> impression that if a person could somehow be entangled in a criminal
> prosecution, there is a likelihood of Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016 -20- imminent
> settlement. Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not
> involve any criminal offence, by applying pressure through criminal
> prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged.
21.In Ajay Mitra v. State of M.P. [2003 (3) SCC 11], the Apex Court had
occasion to consider a case wherein the FIR was sought to be quashed invoking
the powers under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme
Court held thus :
> "19. The High Court has held that the petitions filed by the appellants for
> quashing the complaint and the FIRs registered against them are premature.
> The question which arises is that where the complaint or the FIR doe snot
> disclose commission of a cognizable offence, whether the same can be quashed
> at the initial stage. This question was examined by this Court in State of
> W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha, AIR 1982 SC 949 and it was held that the first
> information report which does not allege or disclose that the essential
> requirements of the penal provision are prima facie satisfied, cannot form
> the foundation or constitute the starting point of a lawful investigation.
> It is surely not within the province of the police Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016
> -21- to investigate into a report (FIR) which does not disclose the
> commission of a cognizable offence and the Code does not impose upon them
> the duty of inquiry in such cases. It was further held that an investigation
> can be quashed if no cognizable offence is disclosed by the FIR. The same
> question has been considered in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, AIR 1992 SC
> 604 and after considering all the earlier decisions, the category of cases,
> in which the Court can exercise its extraordinary power under Art.226 of the
> Constitution or the inherent power under S.482, Cr. P.C. either to prevent
> abuse of the process of any Court or to secure the ends of justice, were
> summarised in AIR para 108 of the Report and sub-paras (1) to (3) thereof
> are being reproduced herein below (SCC p. 378, para 102) (1) Where the
> allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if
> they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not
> prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
> (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other

22.In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia (AIR 1988 SC 709) (supra) the Supreme Court
held thus :
> The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial
> stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the Court is as to
> whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the
> offence. It is also for the Court to take into consideration any special
> features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is
> expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to
> continue. This is so on the basis that the Court cannot be utilised for any
> oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the Court chances of an ultimate
> conviction are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be
> served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the Court may while
> taking into consideration the special facts of a Crl.M.C. No.1783 of 2016
> -23- case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary
> stage.
23.As such, I am of the firm view that the ingredients of the offence under
Section 406 or Section 420 is clearly not made out. Therefore this is a fit
case for interference under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In
the result, this petition is allowed. Annexure-A1 FIR in Crime No.206 of 2016
of the Palarivattom Police Station and all further proceedings pursuant
thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
