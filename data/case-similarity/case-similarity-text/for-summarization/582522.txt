53\. During the --Writ Petitions, by virtue of the _.inte1'im

_thell'i'v.Adyeoaite:'wjyeneral addressed a letter dated 3.8.2009' ._to
bringing to their notice the obsegrvatioiisllinadeby Court which reads thus:
,.._.the Shanbhogues should be given an of Rs.1000/-- per month as an acihoc >

a lump sum can be Q made having regard to the number of years of services put
in by the Shanbhogues. For each of year of service. an amount can be
determined E96 provision for payrnent of pension t:o Ex:-Shaiibogs, if they
have worked for more than nine months in a year durir1g~--.yt;hei1' service,
it can be treated as one year of service and"aVusu'rn"-oi' Rs.2000~OO could be

th'e..Advo-gaten_Geii'erai proinptiy informed the Government about

sought for. The Finance Dep_artinenxtA:'by eornmuiiication dated 17.12.2009

to EX~Shanbogs and also for di? for every completed year. This adhoc
