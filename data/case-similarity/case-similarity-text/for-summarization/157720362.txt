    JUDGEMENT
1\. The brief resume of the prosecution case against the accused Baljeet Singh
and Ganesh is that on 14.04.1995 at 6.05p.m. at H. No.3557, Dispensary Wali
Gali, Dharampura, Gandhi Nagar, Delhi within the jurisdiction of PS Gandhi
Nagar, they had knowingly and dishonestly infringed the copyright of Super
Cassettes by copying the same and they were found in possession of
plates/other equipments for the purpose of infringement of copyright and
thereby committed offences punishable U/s.63/65 of the Copyright Act within
the cognizance of this Court.
2\. On the above stated story as per the allegations of the prosecution, on
finding prima facie case against both the accused persons vide order dt.
25.06.1996 of Sh.S. K. Sharma, the then Ld. MM, Shahdara, the charges were
framed against the accused Baljeet Singh and Ganesh for the offences
punishable u/s.63/65 of the Copyright Act. To the charges the accused persons
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC
NO.63/95  3 and thus the trial has commenced.
3\. For proving its case the prosecution has examined a total number of three
prosecution witnesses .
Out of these three prosecution witnesses PW1 HC Gauri Shanker proved the copy
of FIR as Ex.PW1/A submitting that on the basis of rukka sent by ASI Rakesh
Kumar through ct. Ishwar Singh, he recorded FIR no.63/95 with P.S. Gandhi
Nagar. Thus, this witness was a formal witness who came to the witness box to
authenticate the registration of the case.
Whereas, PW2 Satish Kapoor being the complainant came to the witness box to
prove his complaint on which the FIR was lodged and also testified that the
alleged articles were recovered from the H. No.3557, Dharampura, Gandhi Nagar
and where the accused Baljeet was found present. Thus, this witness could
prove the complaint regarding the commission of offence by the accused as well
as the proceedings done by the police officials at the spot.
Whereas, PW3 Sajeev Kapoor was the public witness who deposed that he
alongwith the complainant Satish Kapoor went to PS State vs. Baljeet Singh &
Anr. CC NO.63/95  4 where complainant lodged his complaint and thereafter he
alongwith the complainant, IO ASI Rakesh Kumar and other police officials went
at the premises bearing no. 3557, Dharampura, Gandhi Nagar where accused
Baljeet was found making pirated cassettes and alleged articles were seized.
Thus, both the abovesaid two witnesses were material to the extent of proving
the recovery from the accused Baljeet Singh and the proceeding done by the
police officials at the spot.
4\. During trial, a number of documents were exhibited which includes
complaint Ex.PW2/A, FIR is Ex.PW1/A and seizure memo Ex.PW2/D & Ex.PW2/B, 693
autio cassettes in different films Ex.P1/1 to P1/693, inlay cards 14 or 15 kg.
Ex.P2, 590 blank cassettes Ex.P-3/1 to 590, I C Plane 475 is Ex.P-4/1 to 475,
1000 cassettes without ribbon Ex.P-5/1 to 1000, one cassette recorded capacity
1 to 10 cassettes with stabilizer is Ex.P-6, two cassette player and two
speakers collectively Ex.P-7.
That is all for prosecution evidence.
State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  5
5\. Statement of both the accused persons was recorded under section 313
Cr.P.C. wherein when all the incriminating evidence/documents were put to the
accused persons one by one, they denied the allegations/incriminating evidence
and documents put to them and submitted that all the witnesses were interested
witnesses and that they were innocent and were falsely implicated by the
police officials in this case and that nothing was recovered from their
possession but they did not produce any evidence in their defence.
6\. Written final arguments have been filed on behalf of the complainant and
the same have been forwarded verbatim by the Ld. APP for the State. In the
written final arguments it has been submitted that at the time of the raid
some local persons were asked to join the operation but none agreed to do so.
It has been strenuously argued by the prosecution as well as the complainant
that recovery of such large quantity of infringed/pirated cassettes from the
possession of the accused alongwith the recorded machines ipso facto goes to
show that State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  6 the said audio
cassettes were being reproduced for commercial purposes. It has been argued
that there is no denying the fact that in said premises were occupied by the
accused. It has been further argued that the accused did not produce the
documents pertaining the ownership of the cassettes or licence etc.. Section
2(M3) of the Copy Right Act, Section 13, Section 14, Section 51, Section 52A,
Section 68A, Section 3 and Section 65 of the Copy Right Act have been referred
to and relied upon by the complainant as well as the prosecution and it has
been argued that the copy right is a negative right which prevents others from
copying or reproducing the work. It has been further argued that once the
accused person came to know of the criminal case that it is based on non-
existent facts, they should have challenged the same but they did not do so.
It has been further argued that minor discrepancies are not the indication of
falsehood and the discrepancies are due to normal error and due to lapse of
time. AIR 1973 Supreme Court 28 & AIR 1981 Supreme Court 1390 have been relied
upon. Further, relying upon AIR 1987 SEC 98 and AIR 1985 Supreme Court 1092,
it has been argued that the evidence of police witnesses is to be believed
like other witnesses and their testimony cannot be discarded on the basis of
being State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  7 a police official. Lastly,
the complainant as well as the prosecution have relied upon JT 1996(8)Supreme
Court 262 titled as State of Andhra Pradesh vs. Nagoti Venkataramana in which
it has been held that for the offence u/s.68A r/w/s.52A, it is unnecessary for
the prosecution to drag owner and trace the owner of the copy right to come
and adduce evidence and if particulars on video films u/s.52 A do not find
place, it is infringement of copy right.
7\. Proceedings against the accused Baljeet stood abated by the orders dt.
20.08.2007 in the event of his death. Ld. Defence counsel for the accused
Ganesh has filed on record the written final arguments. The Ld. Defence
counsel for accused Ganesh has vehemently countered the prosecution case that
there is no mention of place of occurrence/spot or name or address of the
person engaged in the illegal business as allege. It has been further argued
that no independent witness has been joined. The alleged recovery was made
from the 3rd floor of the house but no person from ground to the second floor
was asked to join the investigation. It has been further argued that PW2
Satish Kapoor could not prove any authority from the alleged companies to
institute or lodge State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  8 the
complaints with the police. It has been further argued that there is no
recovery of any cassettes on which Super Media is written about which the
complaint in question has been lodged. It has been further argued that no
proof of piracy has been filed on record and the prosecution failed to prove
the result or the sample. The main thrust of the arguments of the Ld. Defence
counsel for the accused Ganesh is that no recovery has been effected from the
accused Ganesh and there is no evidence against him and the prosecution has
involved the accused Ganesh as an accused merely on the basis of the
disclosure of the accused Baljeet Singh on the ground that Ganesh was the
owner of the factory but, no evidence to that effect has been collected or
produced by the prosecution at all. It has been strenuously argued by the Ld.
Defence counsel that the disclosure statement of the co-accused is
inadmissible against the accused Ganesh. It has been further argued that he
was not present at the time of alleged raid. It has been further argued that
there are material contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution
witnesses and further that PW2 does not know what was the initials of the
seals though the seal was given to him. It has been further argued that last
but not the least the IO of the case has not been examined and the State vs.
Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  9 witnesses who have been examined have
failed to prove the case of the prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt and as
such the accused is entitled for acquittal.
8\. On appreciation of evidence on record, consisting of ocular as well as
documentary evidence, in the light of contentions of both the parties, it is
observed that initially the FIR was lodged u/s.63/64/65 & 68 of Copy Right Act
but vide order dt. 25.6.1996 the charges were framed against both the accused
persons u/s.63/65 of the Copy Right Act. It is pertinent to mention here that
the proceedings against the accused Baljeet Singh stand abated as on date and
as such there is no need to discuss the evidence and culpability of the
aforesaid accused because in the event of abatement of the proceedings against
him, the story is put to an end so far as the accused Baljeet Singh is
concerned. Hence, I would like to deal with the evidence led by the
prosecution and would like to discuss the material available on record only
with respect to the accused Ganesh. The court has to see as to whether the
prosecution has been able to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond any
reasonable doubt against the accused Ganesh or not.
State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  10
9\. There cannot be any dispute with the proposition with the law as laid down
in the authorities relied upon by the complainant or the prosecution but, the
court has to see as to whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the
case of the accused Ganesh is covered by the ratio of the above stated
authorities or not.
10\. The Ld. Defence counsel for the complainant as well as the Ld.
APP for the State have submitted that at the time of the raid some local
persons were asked to join the operation but none agreed to do so, whereas,
Ld. Defence counsel for the accused Ganesh has strenuously argued that despite
the availability of number of witnesses, no independent witness was joined. It
has been further argued that the alleged recovery was made from the third
floor of the house but no person from ground floor or from second floor was
asked to join the investigation. It has to be seen that PW2 in the cross-
examination has categorically stated that neither the SHO nor the IO called
any shopkeeper of the public persons to join the investigation. It has been
further submitted by him that there were many shops in between the police
station and place of spot but, none was called by the IO to join the State vs.
Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  11 investigation. It has been further
submitted that they did not inquire from the residents of first and second
floor and the IO did not ask anyone as to who is residing on the ground floor,
1st floor and 2nd floor. Similarly PW3 has stated in his cross-examination
that he did not ask anyone to join the investigation in between the path. PW3
has further submitted that IO had requested 4-5 persons to join the
investigation near the spot but the IO did not write name and addresses of the
persons who refused to join the investigation in his presence. PW 3 has
further submitted that he cannot tell whether the police officials recorded
the statement of the persons who were residing at 1st or 2nd floor. It is a
settled law that if despite the availability of the independent and public
witnesses, none is joined in the investigation then the story of the
prosecution comes under the shadow of doubt. In this regard reliance is placed
on Harjit Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab 2001(3) JCC 1601.
'...that in the absence of independent witnesses and the alleged place of
concealment being accessible to public, the evidence of disclosure statement
and the consequent recovery of arms do not at all inspire confidence...' State
vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  12
11\. Further, in the written final arguments, the Ld. Counsel for the
complainant as well Ld. APP for the State have strenuously argued that the
recovery of such large quantity of infringed/pirated cassettes from the
possession of the accused alongwith the recording machines ipso facto goes to
show that the said audio cassettes were being reproduced for commercial
purposes.
12\. It is a settled proposition of law that in order to bring home the guilt
of the accused, the prosecution is bound to prove the same beyond any
reasonable doubt. Every reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence
with the accused has to be wiped out. Criminal liability cannot affixed merely
on the basis of the presumptions and assumptions.
13\. First of all, I would like to point out here that no recovery at all has
been effected from the accused Ganesh. The accused Ganesh has been roped on
the basis of the disclosure statement of the accused Baljeet Singh wherein he
has disclosed that he had been working with the accused Ganesh Dutt Ojha in
house no.3357, Dispensary Wali Gali, Dharampura on a monthly salary of
Rs.900/- and his owner Ganesh Dutt State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95
13 Ojha for the last one and a half month was engaged in the business of
duplicate cassettes and on the date of the incident his owner had gone in the
marriage of his niece at Bikaner and had asked him to record the vacate
cassettes of various films.
14\. Needless to mention that at the time of the raid by the police officials
and the complainant, accused Ganesh was not present at the premises in
question. To my mind, the prosecution was required to prove that the aforesaid
premises in question belonged to the accused Ganesh and further that the
accused Ganesh was the owner thereof, the accused Baljeet Singh was working
under him at a monthly salary of Rs.900/-, on the date of the incident the
accused Ganesh had gone to Bikaner for attending the marriage of his niece and
last but not the least that accused Baljeet Singh was recording the cassettes
on the orders of the accused Ganesh but the prosecution has utterly failed in
proving any of these things. There is not even an iota of evidence against the
accused Ganesh which has been brought home by the prosecution. It is a settled
law that in the absence of any recovery, the disclosure statement of the co-
accused is not at all admissible in evidence. In this State vs. Baljeet Singh
& Anr. CC NO.63/95  14 regard is placed on the observations made in a case
1997 II AD (DELHI) 355 titled as Kamal Kishore vs. The State through Delhi
Administration wherein it was observed that :
> "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - Sec.227,228 -
            "Charge"       -   Framing    of   Evidence          Act,      1872        -
            Confession/Disclosure        statement      -     Not       leading       to
> recovery - Co-accused also made disclosure statements which led to recovery
> - Both are not admissible in evidence - Hence charge cannot be framed
> against petitioner."
15\. Further, I find force in the submissions of the Ld. Defence counsel that
the case of the prosecution is absolutely is a case of no evidence at all
against the accused Ganesh as nothing was recovered from his possession and
further that no evidence has been collected or produced by the prosecution to
prove the disclosure statement of accused Baljeet Singh against the accused
Ganesh and further that the disclosure statement of co-accused is inadmissible
against the accused Ganesh.
State vs. Baljeet Singh & Anr. CC NO.63/95  15
16\. Therefore, on the basis of above observations on law and facts, leaving
aside other contradictions, in the light of the above said discussion, I have
no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt
of the accused Ganesh. Thus, the accused Ganesh is acquitted from the charges
levied against him for the offences punishable u/s.63/65 of Copy Right Act.
