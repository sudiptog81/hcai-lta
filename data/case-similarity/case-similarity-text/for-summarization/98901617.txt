JUDGMENT
(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Code'), the appellant - original defendant has challenged an order dated
31.8.2016 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Patan (hereinafter
referred to as 'the learned Trial Court') below application Exh.6 in Trade
Mark Suit No.1 of 2016 by which the learned Trial Court has allowed the
application Exh.6 filed by the original plaintiff - respondent herein under
Order XXXIX, Rule 1 and 2 of the Code and restrained the appellant - original
defendant from using the name of "VADHIYARI" and/or other mark which may be
identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's registered trademark
"VADHIYAR BIJ" till the suit is finally disposed of.
2\. Pursuant to the notice issued by this Court, the respondent has appeared
and filed affidavit-in-reply and opposed grant of any relief prayed for by the
appellant.
3\. The parties have produced relevant documents which were part and parcel of
the suit before the learned Trial Court. Learned advocates appearing for the
respective parties have consented for final hearing of the appeal though the
same was kept for admission hearing. Hence, the present appeal is taken up for
final disposal. The matter is arising under the provisions of Trade Marks Act,
1990 (hereinafter referred to as 'T.M. Act') as well as Trade Mark Rules, 2002
(hereinafter referred to as 'T.M. Rules'). For the sake of convenience and
brevity, the parties to the present proceedings are referred to as per their
original position in the suit i.e. appellant - defendant and respondent -
plaintiff.
4\. The case of the plaintiff is as under :-
             4.1         That the plaintiff, namely, M/s. Dharti Seeds is a sole

proprietary concern firm and carrying on business with regard to manufacturing
and marketing of Seeds for Grains and Plants and allied goods. The plaintiff
firm is registered with the Commercial Tax Department of Government of Gujarat
under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 since 6.2.2010 for which a
Certificate of Registration is issued. The plaintiff is also registered under
the Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957, from 2010\. It
is the case of the plaintiff that he is dealing in different types of seeds
under the name of "VADHIYAR BIJ" from 2008 and was selling products under
different names with regard to the nature of the product. The plaintiff had
applied under Section 23 (2) of the T.M. Act read with Rule 62 (1) of the T.M.
Rules for having trademark "VADHIYAR BIJ" by applying on 7.7.2010. Prior to
submission of the said application and thereafter, the plaintiff had submitted
the designs of the bags to the competent authority in which the goods were
being sold having name "VADHIYAR BIJ". The application which was filed by the
plaintiff under the provisions of T.M. Act for the registration of the word
"VADHIYAR BIJ", was approved by the Registrar of Trademarks on 17.1.2014 and
the effect of the Trademark was given from 7.7.2010 i.e. from the date of
application submitted by the plaintiff. The Trademark was sought for
registration under Clause 31 of Schedule IV of the T.M. Act, which was
approved as stated herein above.
4.2 It is the case of the plaintiff that when the plaintiff came to know that
similar goods i.e. seeds etc. were being sold in the market under the name of
"VADHIYARI", when a search was made from Ministry of Commerce and Industries,
Controller General of Patent, Design and Trademarks, the plaintiff found that
the defendant was manufacturing and selling similar goods in the market. The
plaintiff, therefore, issued a registered notice on  Page 3 of 34 HC-NIC Page
3 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 3 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT
15.10.2015 to the defendant and asked the defendant not to infringe the
trademark "VADHIYAR" and thereafter passing off the goods in the similar name.
The notice was replied by the defendant on 2.11.2015 and refused the claim
made by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff filed Trade Mark Suit No.1 of
2016 before the District Court, Patan and prayed for the following prayers :-
> "(A) THAT, the Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the defendant, their
> servants, agents, retailers, stockiest, dealers and distributors by an order
> of temporary injunction from manufacturing and marketing Agriculture Seeds
> (Impugned Goods) under trade mark VADHIYARI (Impugned Mark) and/or any other
> mark which may be identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
> registered trade mark VADHIYAR and thereby defendant be restrained from
> committing an act of infringement of the plaintiff's registered trade mark
> of VADHIYAR.
> (B) THAT, the Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the defendant, their
> servants, agents, retailers, stockiest, dealers and distributors by an order
> of temporary injunction from using trade mark VADHIYARI and/or any other
> trade mark, which may be identical with and/or deceptively similar with the
> plaintiff's trade mark VADHIYAR and from manufacturing, marketing and using
> trade mark VADHIYARI in any manner and thereby restrain them from committing
> an act of passing off and enable others to pass off impugned goods as and
> for the goods of the plaintiff with trade mark  Page 4 of 34 HC-NIC Page 4

> VADHIYARI and/or any other trade mark, which may be identical with and/or
> deceptively similar with the plaintiff's trade mark VADHIYAR in which the
> plaintiff has reputation and goodwill.
> (C) THAT, the Hon'ble Court be pleased to order the defendant to pay the
> cost of the present proceeding.
> (D) THAT, any other and further relief, that may be deemed fit and proper,
> looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, may be granted in favour
> of the plaintiff."
4.3 The plaintiff also filed an application Exh.6 under Order XXXIX, Rules 1
and 2 of the Code and requested the learned Trial Court that till the suit is
finally heard, interim relief in similar nature of the suit prayers be
granted. The defendants appeared and filed their reply-cum-written statement
to the injunction application as well as suit at Exh.15. Various contentions
were raised about the so-called claim of the plaintiff about using the name
"VADHIYAR BIJ" since 2008 as well as grant of Trademark in "VADHIYAR BIJ" is
illegal since "VADHIYAR" is an area located in certain part of northern
Gujarat and arising from geographical region and, therefore, it cannot be said
that using the similar name is an infringement by the defendant.
4.4 The learned Trial Court after examining the evidence and appreciating the
arguments of the learned advocates appearing for the respective parties, by
the impugned order allowed application Exh.6 filed by the plaintiff as stated
herein  Page 5 of 34 HC-NIC Page 5 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST
2017 5 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT above.
4.6 Hence the present Appeal From Order is preferred by the defendant.
5\. Mr. P.C. Kavina, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. Vijay H. Nangesh
appearing for the appellant - defendant has vehemently submitted that the
learned Trial Court has erred in passing the impugned order since he has not
dealt with several legal as well as factual aspects of the matter though
specifically raised in the written statement filed by the defendant. He would
further submit that "VADHIYAR" is an area located in the North Gujarat and is
expanded from Sami Taluka of Patan District to Radhanpur and beginning of
Kutch District. Therefore, "VADHIYAR" word which has been used in the
trademark "VADHIYAR BIJ" is illegally registered as trade mark in view of the
provisions of Section 9 of the T.M. Act. He would further submit that the
Authority should have refused to register trade mark in view of Section 9 (1)
(b) of the T.M. Act. He would further submit that the applicant has already
filed an application for removal of the trade mark under Section 47 read with
Sections 57, 125 of the T.M. Act before the Appellate Board constituted under
the T. M. Act. He would further submit that since the plaintiff is using the
word which is arising from geographical region, the Authority ought to have
refused to register the name "VADHIYAR BIJ" in favour of the original
plaintiff. He would submit that to establish that "VADHIYAR" is a geographical
area, the defendant had produced a thesis of a researcher before the learned
Trial Court which, prima facie, establishes the say of the defendant and,
therefore, the learned Trial Court ought to have refused the interim relief
prayed for by the plaintiff on this ground alone.

                                                                                                           6 of 35

He would further submit that the T.M. Act provides certain exceptions to
infringement of trade mark granted to a person. In support of his submissions,
he has relied upon Section 30 (2) (a) of the T.M. Act and would submit that
since "VADHIYARI BIJ" which is a registered trademark is used and indicates
geographical region, it cannot be said that the defendant has infringed the
trademark by using the word "VADHIYARI" or "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111". He
would submit that the plaintiff had made an application for registration of
the word "VADHIYARI" with a symbol on 25.6.2015. However, the same has been
withdrawn on 14.3.2016. He would submit that subsequent to withdrawal of the
said application, the defendant has applied for registration of the trademark
in the name of "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" which is pending before the
competent authority for its decision. He would further submit that different
types of commercial ventures are using the name "VADHIYAR" and, therefore, the
say of the plaintiff that VADHIYAR word has some distinct nature is without
any basis. He would submit that different types of business in the name of
Vadhiyar Petroleum, Gurudev Wadiyar Swasahaya Sangha, S.N. Vadhyar & Sons,
Wadiyar Investments Private Limited etc. are carrying on the business wherein
name Vadhiyar is used. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim any exclusive
right in using the word "VADHIYAR" in his product. He would further submit
that the business carried out by the plaintiff in the name of "VADHIYAR BIJ"
is not a well-known trade mark which would mislead the public at large, if the
defendant is carrying on his business in the name of "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI
111".
5.1 Mr. Kavina would further submit that the word "VADHIYAR BIJ" has not
acquired any secondary meaning or  Page 7 of 34 HC-NIC Page 7 of 35 Created On
Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 7 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT distinct nature
since the plaintiff has miserably failed in establishing that he is carrying
on the business from long standing extensive and continuous period. He would
submit that the plaintiff has misled the trade mark authorities by
specifically stating that they are carrying the business in the name of
"VADHIYAR BIJ" since 2008. By taking me through the bills which were produced
before the learned Trial Court by the plaintiff in support of his contention
that if they are carrying on business since 2008, the bills of 2008 refers the
same that "VADHIYAR BIJ" is a trade mark and having particular Registration
Number under the provisions of Value Added Tax Act, since in 2008 neither
Certificate was issued by VAT Authority, nor "VADHIYAR BIJ" was registered as
Trade Mark in the year 2008. He would submit that the authority has not
examined the claim made by the plaintiff in detail and has granted the trade
mark as prayed for by the plaintiff which can be examined in the Civil Suit
during the hearing of the suit as well as the application for interim relief.
In support of his submissions, he has relied upon Section 124 of the T.M. Act.
He would submit that under Section 124 of the T.M. Act, the Court trying the
suit has ample power to stay the suit if it is brought on the record that the
trade mark claimed by the party is under challenge before the Registrar or
Appellate Board. In the present case, the challenge is already made to the
Appellate Board and, therefore, the suit itself ought to have been stayed by
the learned Trial Court. He would submit that the learned Trial Court has also
erred in not accepting the say of the defendant that the suit suffers from
delay and latches in view of the fact that the defendant is using the name
"MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" since 2012 whereas the present suit has been filed
only in the year 2016. By taking me through the relevant bill of 2012, he
would submit that the appellant - defendant is selling the seeds in the name
of "MAHA  Page 8 of 34 HC-NIC Page 8 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST
2017 8 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" from 2012 which has
not been objected by the plaintiff until the suit was filed in the year 2016.
He would further submit that if the relief granted by the learned Trial Court
would continue till the suit is finally heard, there would be irreparable loss
to the defendant whereas there would be no loss to the plaintiff. In support
of his submissions, he has relied upon the decision of the Delhi High Court in
the case of Marico Limited v. Agro Tech Foods Limited, delivered on
23.10.2010.
5.2 He would further submit that even otherwise, there is no similarity
between the names used by the parties. In support of his submissions, Mr.
Kavina has relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Cadila Health Care Limited v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited, (2001) 5 SCC
73. He would, therefore, submit that the plaintiff is not entitled for the
reliefs which has been granted by the learned Trial Court. Hence, the present
appeal may be allowed and the impugned order of the learned Trial Court may be
quashed and set aside.
6\. On the other hand, Mr. Harshit Tolia, learned advocate appearing with Mr.
R. H. Bhansali appearing for the respondent - original plaintiff has
vehemently opposed this appeal and submitted that the learned Trial Court has
dealt with all the contentions raised by the parties and has rightly come to
the conclusion that there is a prima facie case made out by the plaintiff that
the defendant has infringed upon the trade mark registered in favour of the
plaintiff way back from 2000. He would submit that the plaintiff is in the
business of grains from 2008 and started manufacturing and thereafter
distributing various types of grains and attained popularity in the market in
view of the good quality provided to the people at large. By taking me through
the  Page 9 of 34 HC-NIC Page 9 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017
9 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT communication dated 16.9.2009 issued by the
concerned department of the State of Gujarat, he would submit that word
"VADHIYAR BIJ" is used on the bags for selling the same. By taking me through
such approved bags, he would submit that the same suggests of the year 2008-09
and lot number is also of 2008 which prima facie establishes use by the
plaintiff from the year 2008\. He would further submit that subsequent to an
application made by the plaintiff for registration, a notice was served to the
plaintiff from the trade mark registry for satisfying it about the usage of
the word "VADHIYAR BIJ". The said notice was issued on 3.8.2011. In response
to the said notice, a detailed reply was submitted by the plaintiff to the
Registrar of Trademark on 29.2.2012 and ample material was provided by
supporting affidavit. The turnover was shown of each year i.e. from 2008
onwards and after examining the same, Registration Certificate has been issued
by the authority. He would submit that till "VADHIYAR BIJ" was registered by
the Authority, objections were never raised by any person including the
defendant about the same. He would submit that the defendant should have
raised objection if it is his say that he is using the word "MAHA SAMRAT
VADHIYARI 111" since 2012, because the registration has been finally granted
on 17.1.2014. No steps and/or objection and/or defense have been taken by the
defendant or any party with regard to using the word "VADHIYAR" for
manufacturing and distributing under Clause 31 of Schedule IV of the T. M.
Act. He, therefore, would submit that the defendant cannot now claim that he
may also be permitted to use the word "VADHIYARI" or "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI
111" for manufacturing and distributing the same items falls under Clause
31\. He would submit that even the defendant had applied for registration of
word "VADHIYARI" only on 25.6.2015. However, the same has been withdrawn on
14.3.2016 i.e. after filing of the  Page 10 of 34 HC-NIC Page 10 of 35 Created
On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 10 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT suit by the
plaintiff on 1.3.2016. He would submit that the case put forward by the
defendant that they are selling the product in the name of "MAHA SAMRAT
VADHIYARI 111" is baseless in view of the fact that the defendant themselves
had applied for registration of "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" only on 14.3.2016
i.e. subsequent to filing of the suit by the plaintiff and on the same day, he
withdrew his earlier application for registration of Trademark in the name of
"VADHIYARI". He, therefore, would submit that the conduct of the plaintiff
clearly established that he wants to infringe the rights of the plaintiff who
have valid registration with regard to particular name. There is difference in
the name of Vadhiyar Bij or and Vadhiyar or Maha Samrat Vadhiyari and that to
using the same for selling the goods which fall under Clause 31 of the Act.
When the plaintiff is owner of the registered trade mark, using similar name
and for same goods would be squarely covered under Section 29 of the T.M. Act,
public at large would be mislead at the time of purchase of the goods.
6.1 He would further submit that under old Trade Mark Act, 1958, the Trade
Mark Registrar had power to refuse a trade mark under Section 9 (1) (d) if one
applies which suggest use of geographical name, whereas under Section 9 (1)
(b) of the new Act of 1999, the word 'geographical name' has been replaced by
geographical origin. He, therefore, would submit that a person can use a
geographical name however such name should not be suggestive as if the goods,
service etc. are directly related to the geographical origin. The seeds
manufactured and distributed by the plaintiff are not at all suggestive that
Vadhiyar region is known for seed for years together. He would further submit
that the defendant himself has applied for regularization of a Trade mark,
which includes the origin "Vadhiyar".

             6.2         Mr. Tolia would further submit that the validity of the
word "VADHIYAR" is under challenge before the Appellate Board by the
plaintiff. Therefore, the Board would be the competent authority to deal with
the same. He would further submit that the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court
in the case of Lupin Limited and another v. Johnson and Johnson and another,
2015 (61) PTC [Bom] [FB], after considering the decision of the Marico Limited
v. Agro Tech Foods Limited (Supra) has held that only in cases where it is
found by the Court that the registration granted for a trade mark is ex-facie
illegal or fraudulent or shocks the conscience of the Court, it shall refuse
the interim relief. By taking me through the conclusion and the answer to a
reference made in the said decision, he would submit that the defendant has
miserably failed in establishing that some fraud was committed by the
plaintiff with regard to the registration of the trade mark word "VADHIYAR
BIJ".

the case of Procter & Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Company Limited and
others v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Private Limited, 2014 (59) PTC 421
[Del] [DB] has created doubt about the validity of the judgment in the case of
Marico Limited v. Agro Tech Foods Limited (Supra) on merits.
6.4 As far as use of geographical name is concerned, Mr. Tolia has relied upon
the decision of the coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Bahuchar
Gruh Udyog v. Talod Gruh Udyog, (2013) 5 GLR 4500. In the said decision, the
coordinate Bench of this Court after examining the provisions of Section 9 of

of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT the T.M. Act including the proviso, has held that
if the applicant before the Registering Authority has acquired distinctive
character as a result of use may appeal, the authority may not refuse the
registration. He would further submit that in the present case, the plaintiff
was able to establish his case before the Registering Authority and,
therefore, trade mark has been granted in favour of the plaintiff. He has also
relied upon the decision in the case of Gepee Ceval Proteins and Investment
Private Limited v. Saroj Oil Industry, (2003) 27 PTC 190 (Del), M/s.
Bikanervala v. M/s. New Bikanerwala (2005) 30 PTC 113 (Del), Sunder Nagar

6.5 He would further submit that the appellant who intends to now use the word
"MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" and now restrained by the learned Trial Court from
using the same if now is permitted to use the same, there is likely to create
confusion in the people at large. In support of his submissions, he has relied
upon the decision of this Court in the case of Bharat Tiles & Marble Private
Limited v. Bharat Tiles Manufacturing Company 1978 GLR 518. He has also relied
upon the decision of the Delhi High Court dated 4.1.2006 in the case of Hi-
tech Pipes Limited v. Asian Mills Private Limited, 2006 (32) PTC 192 wherein
it is held that if a geographical name has acquired secondary significance and
has distinctiveness in respect to a particular goods, using the same name
would not be permitted if it is established so.

Ramdev Food Products (P) Limited v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and others,
(2006) 8 SCC 726 wherein it is held that Ramdev word was used by one of the
parties. However, another party wanted to use the word "Ramdev Masala" which
was restrained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In the said decision, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has also dealt with the balance of convenience of the parties.
He would, therefore, submit that the word "VADHIYAR" is already registered
with the plaintiff. However, the defendant - appellant herein intends to use
the word "VADHIYARI" and, therefore, the learned Trial Court has rightly
granted interim relief in favour of the plaintiff.
6.7 As far as the submission made by Mr. Kavina with regard to the use of
"VADHIYAR" word by other persons, Mr. Tolia would submit that the same would
not help the appellant since the use of "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" directly
affects the business of the plaintiff. By relying upon the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T. V. Venugopal v. Ushodaya Enterprises
Limited and another, (2011) 4 SCC 85, he would submit that it has been held
that the plaintiff can choose to take action against any person with whom he
has direct competition. He would submit that none of the users of VADHIYAR
word are in the business of the seeds and have ever been granted any
registration with regard to Clause 31 of Schedule IV of the T.M. Act.
6.8 As far as interim relief under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 and 2 of the Code is
concerned, Mr. Tolia has relied upon a decision Heinza Italia and another v.
Dabur India Limited, (2007) 6 SCC 1, the decision in the case of Midas Hygiene
Industries (P) Limited and another v. Sudhir Bhatia and others, (2004) 3  Page

C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT SCC 90 and the decision in the case of Laxmikant V.
Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and another, (2002) 3 SCC 65. He, therefore, would
submit that the appeal is without any merits and hence, the same may be
dismissed.
7\. I have heard learned advocates appearing for the respective parties. The
relevant provisions of the T.M. Act which have been heavily relied upon by the
learned advocates appearing for the respective parties have been reproduced.
8\. As far as submission made by learned advocates about validity of
registration of Vadhiyari Bij in favour of plaintiff and its effects are
concerned, provisions of Sections 9 and Section 30 of the T.M. Act would be
relevant.
The authorities have power to refuse registration of a trade mark on certain
grounds which have been incorporated under Section 9 of the T.M. Act. Section
9 of the T.M. Act reads as under :-
> "9. Absolute grounds for refusal of registration :­ (1) The trade marks ­
> (a) which are devoid of any distinctive character, that is to say, not
> capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of
> another person;
(b) which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade
to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values,
geographical origin or the time of production  Page 15 of 34 HC-NIC Page 15 of
35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 15 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT of
the goods or rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or
service;
(c) which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become
customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established
practices of the trade, shall not be registered:
Provided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the
date of application for registration it has acquired a distinctive character
as a result of the use made of it or is a well­known trade mark.
                          (2)     .......................
                          (3)     ......................."
9\. With regard to the contention raised by Mr. P.C. Kavina about the use of
the word "VADHIYAR" which suggest geographical region, is concerned, I am of
the opinion that "VADHIYAR" might be an area of State of Gujarat which is
known as per its geographical situation, but there is nothing on record to
suggest that this area is known for manufacturing of seeds of different types
of grains. The seeds manufactured in Vadhiyari area neither create some
impression about the qualities, reputation nor other characteristic which
attribute to its geographic origin. It is difficult to accept at this stage
that the grant of "VADHIYARI BIJ" as Trade Mark by the authority to original
plaintiff would mislead the public about the product. When the registration of
the "VADHIYARI BIJ" was granted to the plaintiff, it is difficult to accept
that the authority has not considered the same before issuing the
Registration. In the case of Bahuchar Gruh Udyog v. Talod Gruh  Page 16 of 34
HC-NIC Page 16 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 16 of 35
C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT Udyog (Supra), similar contentions have been answered
by the coordinate Bench and paragraphs 42, 43 and 46 read as under :-
> "42. Further, as could be seen from the Trade Marks Act 1999, it is a
> complete code providing for the procedure and mechanism and for any such
> grievance, the rights and remedies are available. The registration of a
> valid trade mark in favour of the party gives a right to that party to have
> an exclusive use of such mark, and so long as it is not taken out, modified,
> corrected pursuant to a proper remedy under the Act, it will continue to
> have a right in favour of the party which is the owner of such proprietary
> rights or registered trade mark. Therefore, when the respondent is having
> the registered trade mark with the word 'TALOD', it cannot be brushed aside
> or overlooked merely because an objection is raised that the authority has
> registered the trade mark containing a geographical name 'TALOD' and
> therefore it should be ignored. If that is so, it would make the other
> provisions of the Act redundant which provide for an appropriate remedy
> under the Act by making necessary application for the grievance made by
> others.
43\. Chapter IV of the Act refers to 'the Effect of Registration'. Section 28
provides a right which is conferred by registration with regard to exclusive
right to use the trade mark by the person who is having proprietary right of
such trade mark. Section 29 provides for infringement of the trade mark, and
as rightly emphasized by learned Sr. Counsel Shri Mehta  Page 17 of 34 HC-NIC
Page 17 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 17 of 35 C/AO/384/2016
JUDGMENT for the respondent, sec. 29(3) provides " in any case falling under
clause (c) of sub­section (2), the court shall presume that it is likely to
cause confusion on the part of the public." Clause (c) of sec. 29(2) provides
with regard to the identity of the trade mark and the goods, and as discussed
herein above, the items of both the appellant herein and the respondent are
identical i.e. instant mix and when the word 'TALOD' is also sought to be used
by the appellant, it may have the possibility of confusion with the products
of the respondent who is doing the business in the name and style of Talod
Gruh Udyog. Therefore, such presumption has been provided. It is well­accepted
that in such cases of proprietary right in respect of the marks, the
registered owner of the trade mark has a valuable right in the form of
registered trade mark for the purpose of using it in connection with the goods
which has acquired a reputation and goodwill. The use of the word 'TALOD' is
an essential feature in respect of the mark of both the appellant and the
respondent.
46\. Moreover, the submission made by learned counsel Shri Daruwalla as to
whether the similarity of the products or the mark is likely to cause
confusion and the principles of comparison of mark is required to be
considered. Though he has emphasized referring to the label marks trying to
suggest the point of distinction or dissimilarities, it is well accepted that
while considering the similarity, whether the goods of one party is likely to
be confused and passed off or not with the mark or the label of the other has
to be  Page 18 of 34 HC-NIC Page 18 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST
2017 18 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT compared as a whole. Again, the criteria
for the purpose of injunction in case of infringement and passing off would be
different, though in both the cases when the goods are similar, the aspect of
similarity or dissimilarity between the two products as well as the marks as a
whole are always considered. In other words, in an action for alleged
infringement of a registered trade mark it has to be seen whether the mark of
the defendant is identical with the registered mark of the plaintiff. If it is
identical, the question does not arise. Even if it is not identical, it has to
be considered whether it is deceptively similar and/or likely to cause
confusion in relation to the goods for which the plaintiff has got his mark
registered. It is at this stage the approach in case of infringement of the
registered trade mark and in case of passing off would differ. In case of
infringement of a trade mark if it is prima facie shown that the mark of the
defendant is similar or the moment it is prima facie suggested by the
registered owner of the trade mark that it has a resemblance with his mark or
the product, he may be entitled for injunction."
10\. The Coordinate Bench of this Court in the said decision also relied upon
the decision in the case of Heinza Italia and another v. Dabur India Limited
(Supra) and in the said decision, has held in paragraph 50 as under :-
> "50. A useful reference can also be made to the observations made by the
> Hon'ble Apex Court in a judgment in the case of Heinz Italia and anr. v.
> Dabur  Page 19 of 34 HC-NIC Page 19 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST
> 2017 19 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT India Ltd. (supra) where it has been
> observed referring to the criteria to be applied that the test is whether
> the particular mark has obtained acceptability in the market so as to
> confuse the buyer as to the nature of product he was purchasing. It is
> observed that in passing off again similarities rather than dissimilarities
> have to be noted. It is required to be mentioned that in the present case it

> that it could not be appropriated by anybody and even if its exclusive use
> could be justified, the decision could be arrived at only after the evidence
> has been recorded. The Hon'ble Apex Court referring to the various aspects
> including the facts had granted injunction."
11\. It is an undisputed fact that the application submitted by the plaintiff
for registering the word "VADHIYAR" was processed by the authority and after
inviting objections from the public at large and after examining the material
produced, has granted the same in favour of the plaintiff. If the documents
produced by the plaintiff are perused, necessary documents have been produced
before the Authority and after examining the same, registered trade mark has
been granted to the plaintiff w.e.f. 7.7.2010. It is true that the documents
which are produced with regard to bills of 2008, the registered trade mark is
mentioned though it was not registered. However, at the stage of hearing of an
interim injunction application, I would not like to express any opinion in
view of the fact that the present appellant had withdrawn his application for
using the word "VADHIYARI"

subsequent to filing of the suit in question and applied for registered trade
mark word "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111" as well as the case put forward by the
appellant that he was using the said word from 2012 since the application has
been filed in the year 2016. At this, I would not like to observe anything
about the documents of 2012 produced by the defendant by which he has tried to
establish that he is doing business in the name of "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYARI 111"
though he has applied for registration of the said name in the year 2016 and
that too after filing of the suit and withdrawing his earlier application.
12\. As far as the submissions made by Mr. Kavina that there is no
infringement of the trade mark in view of Section 30 of the Act is concerned,
Section 30 of the T.M. Act is reproduced which reads as under :-
> "30. Limits on effect of registered trade mark. ­ (1) Nothing in section 29
> shall be construed as preventing the use of a registered trade mark by any
> person for the purposes of identifying goods or services as those of the
> proprietor provided the use ­

(a) the use in relation to goods or services indicates the kind, quality,
quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production
of goods or of rendering of services or other characteristics of goods or
services;

                         (4)     ............."
13\. As far as the above argument is concerned, I have already answered that
the word "VADHIYAR" has already acquired distinctive character as a result of
use made by it and the original plaintiff is in the business from 2008 or at
least since 2010 as well as the differences between a use of geographical name
and not geographical origin.
14\. As far as the case put forward about the infringement of registered Trade
Mark is concerned, provisions of Section 29 of the T.M. Act would be relevant
which reads as under :-

17\. After discussing various decisions of various High Courts including the
decision in the case of Marico Limited, the conclusions arrived at by the Full
Bench in paragraph 59 reads as under :-
> "59. In a nutshell, our conclusions are as under :­ (1) The expression 'if
> valid' in Section 28 and the words 'prima facie evidence of the validity of
> the trade mark' in Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (the Act) must be
> given their plain and natural meaning.
The plain and natural meaning is given to these phrases by various High
Courts. (paras 24, 26, 29, 31, 35, 44 & 56)  Page 28 of 34 HC-NIC Page 28 of
35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 28 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT (2)
Though the object of providing registration of trade mark is to obviate the
difficulty in proving each and every case the plaintiff's title to the trade
mark, the object is achieved by raising a strong presumption in law to the
validity of the registration of the trade mark and heavy burden is cast on the
defendant to question the validity of the trade mark. (Paras 34, 43, 55 & 57)
(3) A challenge to the validity of the registration of the trade mark can
finally succeed only in rectification proceedings before the Intellectual
Property Appellate Board. However, there is no express or implied bar taking
away the jurisdiction and power of the Civil Court to consider the challenge
to the validity of the trade mark at the interlocutory stage by way of prima
facie finding. (Paras 34 and 53) (4) There is nothing in the Act to suggest
that any different parameters for grant of injunction are required to be
applied when a plaintiff seeks injunction on the basis of registered trade
mark. The relief of injunction being a relief in equity, when the Court is
convinced that the grant of interim injunction would lead to highly
inequitable results, Court is not powerless to refuse such relief. (Paras 35,
36 & 47) (5) However, a very heavy burden lies on the defendants to rebut the
strong presumption in favour of the plaintiff on the basis of the registration
at the  Page 29 of 34 HC-NIC Page 29 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST
2017 29 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT interlocutory stage. The plaintiff is not
required to prove that the registration of a trade mark is not invalid, but
only in the cases where the factum of registration is ex facie totally illegal
or fraudulent or shocks the conscience of the Court that the Court may decline
to grant relief in favour of the plaintiff. (Paras 25, 27 & 55) (6) It is not
sufficient for the defendant to show that the defendant has an arguable case
for showing invalidity. The prima facie satisfaction of the Court to stay the
trial under Section 124 of the Act is not enough to refuse grant of interim
injunction. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as, the registration
being ex facie illegal or fraudulent or which shocks the conscience of the
Court that Court will refuse the interim injunction in favour of the
registered proprietor of the trade mark. (Para 57) 86 (7) The Division Bench
in the case of Maxheal Pharmaceuticals considered it as the view of Vimadalal,
J. that it is "the practice of this Court" to grant injunction to the holder
of a registered trade mark. However, there was no sound footing for the
Division Bench to recognize it as a long­standing practice of this Court.
(Para 33) (8) Though it is considered as a practice of this Court in granting
injunction in favour of the plaintiff having a registered trade mark, the same
cannot be  Page 30 of 34 HC-NIC Page 30 of 35 Created On Sat May 06 02:01:49
IST 2017 30 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT treated as a total embargo on the
power of the Court to refuse grant of interim injunction. In exceptional
cases, that is in cases of registration of trade mark being ex facie illegal,
fraudulent or such as to shock the conscience of the Court, the Court would be
justified in refusing to grant interim injunction. (Para 33) (9) As regards
the controversy at hand, the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 are not
comparable with the provisions of the Designs Act, 2000 and the Patent Act,
1970. (Paras 37 and 38)"
18\. The reference was answered in paragraph 60 which reads as under :-
> "60. The question posed for consideration in the reference :­ "Whether the
> Court can go into the question of the validity of the registration of the
> plaintiff's trade mark at an interlocutory stage when the defendant takes up
> the defence of invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff's trade mark
> in an infringement suit?" is answered thus :­ In cases where the
> registration of trade mark is ex facie illegal, fraudulent or shocks the
> conscience of the Court, the Court is not powerless to refuse to grant an
> injunction, but for establishing these grounds, a very high threshold of
> prima facie proof is required.

C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT It is, therefore, open to the Court to go into the
question of validity of registration of plaintiff's trade mark for this
limited purpose, to arrive at a prima facie finding."
19\. In the case of Procter & Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Company Limited
and others v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Private Limited (Supra), the
Division Bench of the Delhi High Court has held in paragraph 10 (x) and has
raised doubt about the validity of the decision in the case of Marico Limited
(Supra) since other decisions were not considered by the learned Single Judge.
20\. As far as the use of word "VADHIYAR" by other organizations are
concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T. V. Venugopal v.
Ushodaya Enterprises Limited and another (Supra) has held in paragraph 87
which reads as under :-
> "87. Learned counsel for the respondent company also placed reliance on
> Prakash Roadline Limited v. Prakash Parcel Service (P) Ltd. 48 (1992) Delhi
> Law Times 390, the Delhi High Court held that :­ ".........Merely because no

> plaintiff is not entitled to take action against the defendant. The other
> parties may not be affecting the business of the plaintiff. They may be
> small­time operators who really do not matter to the plaintiff.
Therefore, the plaintiff may not chose to take any action against them. On the
contrary, the plaintiff feels  Page 32 of 34 HC-NIC Page 32 of 35 Created On
Sat May 06 02:01:49 IST 2017 32 of 35 C/AO/384/2016 JUDGMENT danger from
defendant in view of the fact that the defendant's promoters are the
ex­Directors/employees of the plaintiff who are fully in the know of the
business secrets of the plaintiff. Therefore, the mere fact that the plaintiff
has not chosen to take any action against such other parties cannot disentitle
the plaintiff from taking the present action. This contention is, therefore,
prima­facie without any merit and is rejected."
21\. Therefore, in my opinion, the plaintiff has made out a strong prima facie
case which has been properly dealt with by the learned Trial Court and has
rightly restrained the defendant (Appellant herein) from using word "VADHIYAR"
or "MAHA SAMRAT VADHIYAR 111" till the suit is finally heard.
As far as interim relief is concerned, the decision in the case of Midas
Hygiene Industries (P) Limited and another v. Sudhir Bhatia and others (Supra)
would be applicable in the present case.
22\. In this view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the present appeal
is meritless and the impugned order dated 31.8.2016 passed by learned
Additional District Judge, Patan below application Exh.6 in Trade Mark Suit
No.1 of 2016 does not call for any interference. Hence, the present appeal is
accordingly dismissed. Civil Application also stands dismissed.
23\. The learned Trial Court is hereby directed to expedite the hearing of the
suit being Trade Mark Suit No.1 of 2016.
