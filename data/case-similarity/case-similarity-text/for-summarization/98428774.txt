                                           JUDGMENT
PER HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K. GAUBA, JUDICIAL MEMBER
1\. These matters have been taken up by video conference mode on account of
pandemic conditions, it being no advisable to hold physical hearing.
2\. The question of fairness of promotional dispensation in the nature of
"power banking" for wind power generators has surfaced yet again before this
tribunal.
3\. These appeals are directed against the Wind Tariff Order (no. 6/2018)
dated 13.04.2018 passed by Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission
(hereinafter referred to as "TNERC" or "the Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018
and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 5 of 80 State Commission" or "the Commission")
determining the Tariff Components and all other allied issues related to Wind
Energy Generators (WEGs) installed in the State of Tamil Nadu for the control
period of two years with effect from 01.04.2018 to the extent thereby it made
certain modifications in the dispensation on the subject of "power banking"
declining to withdraw the facility altogether as pressed for by the
distribution licensee i.e. Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation
Limited (hereinafter referred to as "TANGEDCO" or "the distribution licensee"
or "the Discom").
4\. By the impugned order dated 13.04.2018, the State Commission has, inter
alia, increased the banking charges from 12% to 14% apart from holding that
any WEG installed or commissioned after 31.03.2018 is not eligible for banking
facility; withdrawn the banking facility to the existing WEGs including those
which are selling power generated from such WEGs under the Third Party Sale
Scheme; directed that Open Access Charges, hitherto collected at 40% of the
charges applicable for thermal power plants, would be hereafter collected at
50% (Transmission and Wheeling Charges); increased the Scheduling and System
Operation Charges from 40% to 50%; also increased the cross subsidy surcharge
to 60% from existing 50%; determined the "Feed in Tariff" ( FIT) for sale of
power to the Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019
Page 6 of 80 utility at Rs.2.86 without Accelerated Depreciation (AD) and
Rs.2.80 with AD; retaining the payment period at 60 days but reducing delayed
payment levy to 1% interest from 1.5%.
5\. The distribution licensee TANGEDCO is in appeal before us (by Appeal no.
406 of 2019) being aggrieved because, in its submission, the banking facility
is proving financially detrimental to its interest and deserves to be done
away with, it also pressing for increase in Cross subsidy surcharge from 50%
to 100% (instead of 60% as granted by the Commission).
6\. It is the contention of TANGEDCO that the State Commission is not
justified in rejecting the prayer for withdrawal of banking facility to WEGs
in State of Tamil Nadu in larger public interest, it having failed to consider
the provisions of section 61 of Electricity Act, 2003 and the Tamil Nadu
Electricity Regulatory Commission Regulations, 2006 ("TNERC Regulations,
2006") in the right perspective, having glossed over the fact that the benefit
of banking facility is not provided under the statute, the financial impact
for providing such promotional facility passed on to the general consumer
under the tariff order being heavy, the factual data presented for
consideration instead establishing that the banking facility has resulted in
substantial financial loss to the distribution licensee, State Load Dispatch
Centre (SLDC) and the transmission licensee. It is Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265
of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 7 of 80 contended that the order is
inherently contradictory since the banking facility has been unjustifiably
extended for WEGs commissioned prior to 01.04.2018 even while on correct
understanding of the issue it has been disallowed for WEGs commissioned on or
after 01.04.2018.
7\. The other three appeals, in contrast, are by entities which have been
insistent on continuance of the facility of power banking, particularly for
WEGs, arguing that there is no cause for the reliefs afforded to this sector
to be taken away since the grounds on which such promotional measures were
adopted continue to hold good till date.
8\. The appellant (in Appeal no. 191 of 2018) Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills
Association ("TNSMA") represents the Spinning Mills in the State of Tamil Nadu
which have established and continue to establish Wind Power Projects (WPPs) in
the State and contends that the impugned decision is retrograde and violates
the letter and spirit of the extant law which lays great emphasis on such
environmentally friendly renewable sources of energy as wind power, the
promotion of which is the declared State policy and that such dispensation as
at hand would discourage private participation and not be in the overall
interest of the sector, the argument of Discom being actuated by self-interest
which instead must yield to larger public interest. Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265
of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 8 of 80
9\. The appellant (in Appeal no. 195 of 2018) Indian Wind Power Association
("IWPA"), as the name suggests, represents the interest of owners of various
WEGs. It is a registered association consisting of members who have invested
in the putting up of Windmills in India, having on its rolls more than 1500
WEGs all over the country including in the State of Tamil Nadu, professing to
espouse their cause and representing their case before various fora, also
interacting with the regulatory bodies such as TNERC and State Governments.
10\. The other appellant (in Appeal no. 265 of 2018) Watsun Infrabuild Pvt.
Ltd. ("Watson", for short) similarly is an aggrieved party. It had resolved to
set up a wind power project with a capacity of 150 MW at Periyapatti, Tamil
Nadu. It built its own 230/33kV substation to evacuate the entire 150 MW, the
said substation being ready by 31.03.2016 as per the approvals received from
time to time and connected to Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation (TANTRANSCO)
Ltd.'s 400/230/110 kV Anaikadavu substation, in which the Bay earmarked for
the appellant was scheduled to be commissioned by April 2016, but actually
made operational with substantial delay only by the first week of November
2017. It is stated that during the period, due to the looming uncertainty
regarding evacuation of the entire quantum of 150 MW, the Appeal Nos. 191, 195
& 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 9 of 80 appellant could complete
financial closure of only 54 MW of its entire capacity and subsequently
commissioned 54 MW by second week of December 2017 within a month of the
commissioning of the aforesaid TANTRANSCO Ltd.'s (400/230/110 kV) Anaikadavu
substation, the financial closure for the balance 96 MW being completed by
29.12.2017. On the same date, the appellant also paid to the WEG Supplier
advance of 25% of the cost of WEGs issuing Letters for Credit for the balance
75%. It is at that stage that the appellant could vigorously pursue efforts to
execute Power Purchase Agreements ("PPAs") for the balance quantum, the new
users becoming shareholders pursuant to signing of the PPAs, as mandated under
the regulations relating to Group Captive generators. The remaining 96 MW
capacity could be commissioned in phases from May 2018 to November 2018. Thus,
Watsun's project was commissioned broadly in two phases; 54MW capacity by
December 2017 and 96MW capacity by November 2018. It is the case of this
appellant that It had never envisaged to operationalize its project in phases
and that the split occurred because of delay by TANTRANSCO Ltd. in
commissioning its 400 KV substation at Anaikavadu.
11\. The WEGs, through their appeals, assail the impugned order as bad in law,
unfounded and arbitrary.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 10 of 80
12\. Historical perspective always helps in focussing on the areas where the
shoe pinches. We must trace it to the extent necessary. HISTORY OF BANKING
13\. The Electricity Act, 2003, by its preamble, envisages not only "taking
measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting
competition therein, protecting interest of consumers" but also "promotion of
efficient and environmentally benign policies". By section 3, it places the
responsibility on the Central Government to formulate and enforce the National
Electricity Policy and Plan, inter alia, "for development of the power system
based on optimal utilisation of resources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear
substances or materials, hydro and renewable sources of energy", laying a
special emphasis, by section 4, on "permitting stand alone systems (including
those based on renewable sources of energy and other non-conventional sources
of energy) for rural areas.". The statute has delicensed generation of
electricity, encourages private participation in the interests of overall
growth of electricity industry and while placing other connected activities -
transmission, trading and distribution - under regulatory control, assures
open access. Crucially, it is one of the important functions of the State
Electricity Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page
11 of 80 Regulatory Commission, in terms of Section 86(1)(e), to "promote co-
generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by
providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of
electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from
such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area
of a distribution licensee". Thus, the scheme of the law gives a thrust to the
promotion of generation of electricity from renewable and sustainable energy
resources which can be achieved only by the sustained efforts of all
stakeholders. Accordingly, the regulatory Commissions across various States
have incorporated appropriate provisions in the regulatory framework towards
this end, the concept of Renewable Power Obligations (RPO) targets being one
good illustration on the subject.
14\. The concept of "power banking" has been subject of dispute in the past.
It was explained by a bench of this tribunal in judgment in the matter of
Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board vs. Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory
Commission (Appeal no. 98 of 2010), decided on 18.03.2011 reported at 2011 SCC
OnLine APTEL 38: [2011] APTEL 38, as under:
> "18\. ... Banking of energy is analogous to small saving bank account in a
> financial bank. A person deposits his surplus amount in a saving bank
> account. He can withdraw his Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal
> No. 406 of 2019 Page 12 of 80 money from bank any time according to his
> requirement. For this deposited money, he earns some interest. The bank in
> turn gives loan to some other needy customer at a higher rate of interest.
> In this process, saving account holder as well as bank are benefited. Now
> come to electricity banking. Electricity is a commodity which cannot be
> stored. It is to be consumed at the very instant it is produced. Generation
> by Wind Energy Generators solely depends upon availability of wind at a
> particular velocity. In other words it is periodical in nature. Its
> generation is not constant even during a period of 24 hours of a day. It
> could be possible that it generates electricity when captive user does not
> require it. In such a case energy generator banks it with distribution
> licensee who supplies this energy to its consumers at applicable tariff.
> However, for returning the banked energy, Licensee may have to procure
> additional electricity from other sources. Unlike the Banks which pay
> interest to saving account holder, here the licensee, banker of electrical
> energy, earns interest on this banked energy. Thus banking rate electrical
> energy should be nominal."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 15\. Again, in Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v.
> Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2014 SCC OnLine APTEL 166, it
> was explained thus:
> "31\. Banking of wind energy is an essential feature to enable commercial
> viability of a wind energy generator supplying power to a consumer, captive
> or otherwise, through open access. The quantum of generation at the wind
> energy generator varies during the time of the day and season to season from
> nil to full capacity and does not match with the load profile of the
> consumer. The generation of wind energy generator in excess of the load of

> consumed by the Distribution Licensee. Various State Commissions have
> provided different type banking facilities to the wind energy generators to
> discharge their function of promotion of renewable sources of energy under
> the Electricity Act, Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406

> open access consumer in the same Financial Year. Different models for levy
> of banking charges and payment for the unutilized energy by the open access
> consumer at the end of the Financial Year by the Distribution Licensee exist
> in various States."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 16\. Speaking of the State of Tamil Nadu, following the same spirit as
> above, the TNERC framed the Power Procurement from New and Renewable Sources
> of Energy Regulations, 2008 ("Regulations, 2008") which interestingly, inter
> alia, empower the Commission to make provisions for banking of energy
> generated by Renewable Sources of Energy and mandates that:
> "3\. Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy.... (4) The Commission
> may consider appropriate banking mechanism for generation of power from a
> particular kind of renewable source depending upon the inherent
> characteristics of such source."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 17\. It is admitted case for all stakeholders before us that power banking
> facility, introduced initially in 1983, has been afforded consistently since
> 1986, the quantum allowed (in beginning by TNEB and later by TNERC) having

> twelve months since March 2002 till the impugned change by impugned order.
18\. The TNERC had issued two tariff orders one on 15.05.2006 (Tariff Order
2006) and another on 20.03.2009 (Tariff Order 2009). By the time the second
Order came, the Commission had framed the Power Procurement from New and
Renewable Sources of Energy Regulations, 2008. These Regulations, inter alia,
provided thus:
> ""6\. Agreement and Control period The tariff as determined by the
> Commission by a general or specific order for the purchase of power from
> each type of renewable source by the distribution licensee as referred to in
> clause 4(3) shall remain in force for such period as specified by the
> Commission in such tariff orders. The control period may ordinarily be two
> years. When the Commission revisits the tariff and allied issues, the
> revision shall be applicable only to the generator of new and renewable
> energy sources commissioned after the date of such revised order."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 19\. Thus, there can be no dispute that with each new control period, the
> Commission has the jurisdiction to introduce new dispensation based on
> updated information and experience, the existing operators having the
> privilege of continuity of previous norms.
20\. In each of the above-said Tariff Orders (of 2006 and 2009), the
applicability clause clarified that the existing contracts and Appeal Nos.
191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 15 of 80 agreements
between Non-Conventional Energy Sources (NCES) based generators and the
distribution licensee signed prior to the date of issue of such orders would
continue to remain in force, such parties though having the option to mutually
re-negotiate the existing agreements / contracts, if any, in line with new
dispensation before the expiry of the contracts. The banking period was
considered in Tariff Orders of 2006 and 2009 as twelve (12) months from April
to March, the unutilized energy having been allowed to be encashed at 75% of
the preferential tariff rate.
21\. In the tariff order passed on 31.07.2012 (Tariff Order 2012), the
aforesaid period of twelve (12) months banking was retained and the banking
charges were fixed as the difference between the average power purchase cost
through bilateral trading on all India basis taken for a period of two years
and the maximum preferential tariff specified in the order which worked out to
Rs.0.94 per kWhr. This order on banking charges was challenged by stakeholders
before this tribunal (by Appeal Nos.197, 198 of 2013 etc.) wherein the matter
raised was remanded for reconsideration. The decision rendered on 24.05.2013
summarises the conclusions as under:
> "170\. Summary of Our Findings
> i) Circulation of Consultative Paper prior to issuing the tariff order:
> No prejudice has been caused by non circulation of Consultative Paper
> regarding determination of tariff of wind Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018
> and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 16 of 80 energy generators for procurement
> of power by the distribution licensee as the base for this proceeding was
> the last tariff order. All the stake-holders had given their suggestions for
> either retaining or modifying the various norms decided in the earlier
> tariff order and the State Commission after giving them an opportunity of
> hearing and after considering their suggestions and objections on the
> various components of tariff has finally determined the tariff. However,
> regarding the some issues relating to the transmission and wheeling of
> energy from wind generators for captive use and third party sale, the State
> Commission has introduced new method for determination of charges as well as
> the mode for recovery of charges and revised the charges substantially,
> Hence, we feel that the State Commission should have circulated a
> Consultative Paper on these issues. All these issues have been specifically
> challenged by the Appellants in these Appeals. At this stage, when the State
> Commission has already given its findings and given its own reasons for the

> submissions of the parties on some specific issues, we have given our
> findings and remanded the matter to the State Commission for reconsideration
> of those issues where we felt that the Appellants have to be heard by the
> State Commission.
> ii) Applicability of Tariff order:
> The Tariff of the wind energy generators for procurement of energy by the
> distribution licensee would apply prospectively i.e. w.e.f. 1.8.2012 for the
> projects which are commissioned and entered into PPA on or after 1.8.2012.
> For wind energy generators who have entered into PPAs for sale of power to
> the distribution licensees prior to 1.8.2012, the then prevailing tariff
> would be applicable. However, the transmission and wheeling charges for wind
> energy wheeled for captive use or third party sale irrespective of date of
> wheeling agreement, the rate as decided in the impugned order will be
> applicable w.e.f. 1.8.2012.
> iii)Capital cost:
> We confirm the order of the State Commission regarding Capital cost.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 17 of 80
> iv)Return on Equity:
> We do not find any infirmity in the findings of the State Commission.
> v) Annual Maintenance Contract Charges and Insurance Charges:
> We direct the State Commission to allow the same O&M charges and insurance
> charges as a percentage of Capital Cost as decided in the previous tariff
> order dated 20.3.2009.
> vi)Plant Load Factor/Capacity Utilisation Factor: We are not inclined to
> allow any reduction in Capacity Utilisation Factor on account of loss of
> generation due to grid problems. However, we have given directions to the
> State Commission, TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO in paragraph 114 for augmentation
> of transmission and distribution system to avert loss of generation at Wind
> Energy Generators due to inadequate power evacuation infrastructure.
> vii) Time Value of Money:
> This issue is decided in favour of the Appellants in terms of this
> Tribunal's findings in judgement dated 18.12.2007 in Appeal No.205 and 235
> of 2006.
> viii) Recovery of Transmission Charges on the basis of Plant Load Factor:
> This issue is decided as against the Appellants in terms of our findings in
> judgment dated 4.2.2013 in Appeal No.102 of 2012\.
> ix)Abnormal Rise of Banking Charges:
> The findings of the State Commission on this issue are set aside. The State
> Commission is directed to reconsider the computation of the charges after

22\. It is stated that appeals against the above decision are pending before
the Supreme Court. In the remand proceedings, however, TNERC by order dated
31.03.2016 (in R.A No.6 of 2013) fixed the banking charges at 10% in kind. In
tariff order (No. 3 of 2016), twelve (12) months banking was retained and the
banking charges fixed at 12% in kind.
23\. On expiry of the control period for the last said order, the Commission
issued another "Comprehensive Tariff Order on Wind Energy" (Tariff Order 2016)
on 31.03.2016 (no. 3 of 2016). It may Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 19 of 80 be added that in wake of said order
TANGEDCO had filed a Miscellaneous Petition (MP no. 24 of 2016) seeking
alteration of the banking period for the existing WEGs from Financial Year to
Calendar Year and to dispense with the banking arrangement for the new WEGs to
be commissioned after 01.11.2016 which was not entertained by order dated
13.03.2018 for the reason the Commission was then examining the proposal for
issuing a fresh Order on Wind Energy, covering the period from 01.04.2018
onwards. The Tariff Order 2016, however, is under challenge by Appeal (no. 177
of 2016) which is pending,
24\. It is clear from the above that ever since inception, banking has been
retained albeit on changing terms under every Tariff Order passed from time to
time.
25\. The distribution licensee in State of Tamil Nadu (TANGEDCO) has been
opposed to the facility of power banking for long. It appears that in every
successive consultative process undertaken before issuance of every tariff
order by the State Commission, the said utility has been requesting for
removal of the facility of banking provided to WEGs but, on each occasion, the
respondent Commission has deemed it otherwise and, therefore, retained it.
26\. To illustrate the above, it may be noted that during the consultative
process for the tariff order of 2009 (passed on Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of
2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 20 of 80 20.03.2009), TNEB had submitted
that "the banking facility should be restricted to one month instead of
allowing yearlong banking and the banking charges should be increased to 15%."
The suggestion was found to be "too radical to be accepted by the Commission."
When assailed in appeal (no. 98 of 2010), this tribunal upheld the view taken
by the Commission observing that it was TNEB which itself had increased it
within a span of one year (March 2001 to March 2002) on "some rationale", no
"new development" having been cited as might have "warranted the curtailment
of banking period", since the acceptance of suggestion would render "banking
mechanism as meaningless". The relevant part of the said decision may be
extracted as under:
> "20\. ... it is clear that concept of banking has been introduced by
> Appellant Board itself in 1986 to encourage generation of electricity from
> abundant wind power potential available in the state. Banking charges were
> fixed at 2% in 1986 which were enhanced to 5% in 2001. The figure remained
> at 5% till 2009 when the impugned order was delivered by State Commission.
> Thus, there was no reason for State Commission to enhance the same to 15%.
> State  Commission has rightly observed that Page 25 of 67 Judgment in Appeal
> No 98 of 2010 the plea of TNEB (Appellant) to raise the banking charge from
> 5% to 15% were too radical. As regards Appellant Board's demand for
> reduction of banking period from one year to one month, it is pointed out
> banking period was fixed at one month in March 2001, doubled to two months
> in September 2001 and then further increased to one year in March 2002 by
> Appellant Board itself. Thus Appellant Board has increased it from one month
> to one year within a span of one year. There should have been some rationale
> on the part of Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019
> Page 21 of 80 Appellant Board to do so. Appellant Board has not assigned any
> new development, which was not present in 2001-02 and which has warranted
> the curtailment of banking period from one year to one month now. The State
> Commission has rightly rejected it as otherwise it would have rendered
> banking mechanism as meaningless."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 27\. Similarly, at the time of consultative process anterior to tariff order
> dated 31.07.2012 the Discom had urged that the concessional or promotional
> benefit of banking facility may be withdrawn and dispensed with arguing that
> "(e)xtending the concessional promotional benefit of banking will hinder the
> financial position of the TANGEDCO", pleading that the "surplus energy after
> adjustment on every month may be paid at 75% of the concerned power purchase
> cost". The Commission rejected the prayer referring, inter alia, to the
> decision of this tribunal (in Appeal No. 98 / 2010), observing thus:
> "8.2.11 ... The Electricity Act 2003 does not have a specific provision
> regarding banking but at the same time Section 86 (1) (e) of the Act as well
> as Section 61 of the Electricity Act mandates the Appropriate Commission to
> promote co- generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources
> of energy. The Commission has also issued the Regulation for Renewable
> energy, providing for banking ... the Commission could continue the banking
> in pursuant to section 86(1) (e) of the Electricity Act 2003 to promote the
> renewable energy in the state, subject to the adjustment of energy rates
> between the two periods relating to banking of energy and drawal of energy
> from the banking."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 28\. Almost in similar vein, in the course of assisting the Commission for
> tariff order 2016 (passed on 31.03.2016), the Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of
> 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 22 of 80 TANGEDCO had pressed that
> banking provision be dispensed with not only for "the future projects but
> also to the existing projects commissioned before and after 15.05.2006
> irrespective of the tariff order in which the WEG is covered for which
> necessary amendments may be effected in the existing energy wheeling
> agreement". The Commission, however, decided as under:
> "10.11.5 TANGEDCO has contended in R.A No.6 of 2013, wherein the remanded
> issues by ATE were taken up by the Commission, that banking is detrimental
> to the finances of the utility. Commission has observed in R.A No.6 of 2013
> that such concessions are not to be continued forever and has to be
> gradually withdrawn. All stakeholders with the exception of the distribution
> licensee has requested to provide banking facility for a period of 12
> months. 10.11.6 The Commission decides to continue with the provision of
> banking period in this order also. The banking period shall be for a period
> of twelve months commencing from the 1st of April and ending on 31st March
> of the following year."
> 29\. The sum and substance of the above is that the banking facility has
> continued in State of Tamil Nadu with some variation brought about here and
> there in formulation, the impugned order making substantial changes in the
> category of beneficiaries and the terms of the package.
THE IMPUGNED ORDER
30\. On 03.03.2018, the respondent Commission as a prelude to the dispensation
respecting next control period issued a Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 23 of 80 consultative paper for issuance of Tariff
order for Wind energy and related issues, inviting comments/suggestions on or
before 23.03.2018. On the specific subject of banking, these are the various
alternatives proposed by the Commission in the said consultative paper:
> i) To dispense the facility of banking of wind energy but with deemed
> purchase of excess generation.
> (OR)
> ii) Banking facility of one month with time block wise adjustments on
> implementation of DSM regulations and purchase of unutilized energy at the
> end of each month.
> (OR)
> iii) Banking facility for 12 months from January to December with time block
> wise adjustments on implementation of DSM regulations and banking charges of
> 14% in kind and purchase of unutilized energy at the end of the year.
> (OR)
> iv) Banking facility for 12 months from April to March with time block wise
> adjustments on implementation of DSM regulations and banking charges of 14%
> in kind and purchase of unutilized energy at the end of the year.
> There shall be no facility of banking of energy for third party power
> purchase.
31\. On 13.04.2018, the Commission issued the Impugned Order (made effective
from 01.04.2018), ruling on various aspects of reliefs in nature of or
connected to power banking for WEGs. The challenge by WEGs is to the following
aspects of the impugned order (the observations of the Commission extracted
against each): Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019
Page 24 of 80
> (a) Withdrawal of banking facility (i) for 12 months to Wind Power Projects
> commissioned after 31.03.2018 and (ii) altogether for all existing and new
> WEGs selling under Third Party Open Access Sale Scheme, irrespective of date

> "10.1 Banking :

True that such order should come before the period to which it is to be
applied. But administrative delays do at times make it difficult to achieve.
In the case at hand nothing turns on it.
33\. It is, however, vivid that the changes substantially affect adversely the
facility of power banking not only for WEGs commissioned after coming into
force of the impugned tariff order (01.04.2018) but also those operating from
earlier periods, the benefits available on various counts having been
curtailed. The applicability clause strikes a jarring note when it says at the
end by rendering the date of commissioning inconsequential not only for
charges but also "other terms and conditions" though that is the basis of
creating two categories of beneficiaries of banking. ARGUMENTS AGAINST BANKING
& RATE OF CROSS-SUBSIDY Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406
of 2019 Page 32 of 80
34\. It is the argument of TANGEDCO that the WEGs have significantly grown
during the past few years, the State of Tamil Nadu having seen growth of wind
energy capacity of more than 7000 MW as against the energy demand of 13000 MW,
this reflecting surplus wind energy in the State. It is pointed out that as
per the mandate of National Electricity Policy, non-conventional energy
sources are required to be brought at par with the conventional sources of
energy.
35\. The Discom TANGEDCO seeks to press for abolition of the banking facility
for all the WEGSs irrespective of date of commissioning. Its argument is that
the issue relating to the banking facility provided in the wind tariff orders
had led to serious financial implication on the distribution licensee, the
SLDC and TANTRANSCO. The Discom submits that it is under an obligation to
serve its consumers as well as the captive consumers of the WEGs to supply
energy during non-wind season. The unit-to-unit adjustment provided under the
Tariff order has impacted the finances of appellant to a larger extent, the
penalty imposed by Sothern Region LDC (SRLDC) for the deviations in Demand
Side Management bringing about additional serious impact. The lack of spinning
reserves with the WEGs, absence of scheduling and forecasting and the "must
run" status of WEGs has led to continuous Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018
and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 33 of 80 injection of wind power in the grid
even when there is no requirement by the captive consumers of WEGs and the
distribution licensee. The continuous un-scheduled and excess injection of
power compels the distribution licensee to back down generators supplying
cheaper power on a round-the-clock basis, the Discom being obliged to pay
compensation to the backed-down conventional generators and also pay fixed
charges for the quantum of energy contracted with conventional generators
under respective PPAs.
36\. It is pointed out that TNERC in Tariff Order 2012 had accepted that
TANGEDCO has been incurring losses on account of banking:
> "This is stated to be in view of the fact that when the banked energy is
> redrawn by the wind generators, power has to be procured from the market at
> higher rates and therefore the licensee is losing money. The Commission has
> observed in its recent exercise of the Tariff Order that the wind energy for
> captive use has been on the increase year after year. Quantum of wind energy
> wheeled for captive use is about 6000 MUs during 2011-12. It is quite
> possible that excess capacity has been created by some of the consumers so
> that they can meet all their requirements only through captive wind
> generation. Wind season being limited, during the balance months energy is
> being drawn from the banked energy."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 37\. The contention is that wind sector has been more than adequately
> promoted to such extent that utilities in the State are finding it difficult
> to handle the energy generated from WEGs and facing complaints of rampant
> back down. It is argued that such Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
> Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 34 of 80 concessions ought not be continued for
> ever beyond the point of optimum growth of NCES which has already been
> achieved.
38\. It is the ethos embedded in law that in the interest of overall growth of
electricity industry, the activities in nature of generation, distribution and
transmission of have to be conducted on commercial principles. The statute
does not prescribe power banking. The TANGEDCO points out that Section 61(d)
nowhere contemplates that banking facility should be provided in addition to
recovery of cost of electricity in a reasonable manner. The activity of
providing banking services exclusively for WEGs is not contemplated under the
commercial principles envisaged under Section 61 (b). The regulatory
Commission, on the other hand, is under statutory mandate to safeguard the
interest of consumers and at the same time ensure recovery of the cost of
electricity "in a reasonable manner". The argument is that banking facility
for WEGs directly impinges upon the tariff paid by the public at large in the
State of Tamil Nadu and, therefore, must go.
39\. It is argued that Section 61 (g) Electricity Act specifically mandates
that the tariff paid by the consumer should progressively reflect the cost of
supply of electricity and that cross-subsidies are reduced. The plea is that
cost of supply of wind energy by the distribution licensee instead includes
the expenses incurred in providing banking which is ultimately passed onto the
consumers. It is stated that while WEGs are granted undue benefit at the cost
of public, the activity of banking has the adverse effect on the reduction of
cross subsidy.
40\. In the argument of TANGEDCO, for promotion of cogeneration and generation
of electricity from renewable sources Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 35 of 80 of energy, in terms of Section 61(h) of
Electricity Act, schemes providing loan at discounted rates of interest or for
longer period of loan repayment are the appropriate course. The facility of
banking provided exclusively to WEGs, it is submitted, is not a promotional
activity but a source of guaranteed revenue. The cost which the distribution
licensee incurs in providing banking facility, in contrast, as per the
submissions, includes over/under drawl charges, penalty paid on account of
grid disturbance, purchase of high-cost power for supply to the third party /
captive consumers of WEGs during non- wind season and loss of energy charges.
All such costs incurred on account of providing banking facility are
ultimately passed on to consumers through tariff fixed by TNERC. The banking
facility, thus, results in a situation where the consumer's interest is
compromised against the letter and spirit of section 61 which expressly
mandates safeguarding of consumers interest.
41\. The TANGEDCO argues that TNERC has passed the impugned tariff order
without taking into consideration above mentioned facts and grounds
erroneously failing to dispense with banking, in spite of taking note of the
losses incurred by the appellant in continuing to provide such facility to
WEGs.
42\. The Discom TANGEDCO places reliance on the views on the subject of two
other State Commissions viz. Gujarat and Rajasthan
\- both States with substantial growth of infrastructure for wind energy
generation.
43\. The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC), by it tariff order
(no. 02) dated 30.04.2020, held as under:

TNERC which is a statutory body has the power, and the duty, to comply with
Section 61 of the Electricity Act and protect the interest of both the
generators and public at large.
52\. The Discom TANGEDCO is also aggrieved by the dispensation vis-à-vis Cross
Subsidy Surcharge (CSS). It is submitted on its behalf that CSS is meant to
partially compensate the under privileged general public who are being served
by the utility by way of giving subsidized power. It is argued that all WEGs
are liable to pay same CSS as paid by conventional generators, there being no
differentiation on such levy under the Electricity Act, the concession under
the impugned Tariff Order being against legislative mandate, the decision of
TNERC to levy 60% CSS on WEGs being wrong. The plea is that all WEGs have to
comply with Corporate Social Responsibility and TNERC cannot grant a
concession on such social responsibility.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 47 of 80
COUNTER-ARGUMENTS FAVORING BANKING & ANCILLARY MEASURES
53\. The WEGs, on the other hand, argue that it is the State policy that they
are promoted by all possible measures and, therefore, there is no
justification whatsoever for the demand that power banking and ancillary
reliefs be abolished. They point out that productivity of the processes and
technology used by wind power projects is not consistent, it being dependent
essentially on uncontrollable factors such as wind speed, velocity, direction,
climate etc. and, therefore, the lean periods/seasons have to be taken into
account. It is pleaded that the provision for high production (during high
wind periods) be accommodated and adjusted to make up for the losses incurred
during lean periods (of low or no wind seasons) and, therefore, the banking
facility is fully justified even in present-day scenario. It is stated that
the very basis of introduction of this equitable privilege in 1986 in State of
Tamil Nadu, as also adopted in various other States of the country, continues
to be valid.
54\. These appellants representing WEGs challenge the impugned decision to the
extent it holds that the banking period of twelve (12) months (i.e. from the
1st of April to 31st of March of the Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 48 of 80 succeeding year) will be continued for
WEGs commissioned on or before 31.03.2018 but the same period (of 12 months)
will not be given to those WEGs commissioned after 01.04.2018. For such new
WEGs under normal and REC category, banking period / facility is only for one
month. They contend that the impugned Order discriminates between WEGs
regarding banking period on basis of the dates of commissioning and,
therefore, is illegal being without jurisdiction and contrary to the TNERC
Power Procurement from New and Renewable Sources of Energy Regulations, 2008.
55\. The WEGs point out that cross-subsidy surcharge (CSS) has been raised
from 50% to 60% only on the basis that the wind power projects are in a
position to compete with conventional generation projects. It is pointed out
that the State Commission had, by earlier orders, maintained the liability to
pay CSS at 50% but has chosen to do so now without reason. It is contended
that the decision is in the teeth of the objectives of the law and the
policies of the Central and State Government prodding promotion for renewable
power (green power) to substitute fossil fuel generation. According to the
WEGs, it is the duty of the Commission to adopt measures to maximise wind
power sources instead of placing more onerous terms such as payment of
additional CSS in the end use of the wind power. It is urged that the claim
made by TANGEDCO in its cross- Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal
No. 406 of 2019 Page 49 of 80 appeal for 100% CSS must be rejected, it being
contrary to the scheme and objective of the prevalent law.
56\. The WEGs submit that the increase in banking charges is without proper
reasoning or justification, such increase going against the spirit of suitable
measures already considered and implemented in regard to the quantum of
compensation to be provided for availing the banking facilities considering
the wind power as renewable, there being no change in circumstances to provide
for any increase and making it onerous to wind power projects. It is stated
that TANGEDCO did not provide any detail or material before the Commission to
establish that it is not being adequately compensated for providing the
banking facility. It is argued that even if it be assumed that banking charges
need not be reduced such charges cannot be more than what is reasonable for
the services provided. In the submission of WEGs, the increase to 14% amounts
to unjust enrichment of TANGEDCO.
57\. By impugned order, the Capacity Utilisation Factor (CUF) has been
determined at 29.15% as against 18.15% on average prevalent over the last 5
years computed for the WEG installations in the State. From amongst various
factors which have impact on the generation only machine availability is under
the control of the generator, the other two (extent of wind availability or
grid Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 50 of
80 availability) being beyond such control. The WEGs submit that 11% increase
is an unrealistic call on the performance of WEG.
58\. The Open Access (OA) charges have been increased for WEGs from 40% of
normative charges for conventional sources of power to 50% of transmission and
wheeling charges and scheduling system operation charges. It is the contention
of WEGs that levy of such charges qua the installed capacity of the WEG is
when the capacity utilisation factor is only about 20% on annual basis while,
in contrast, the Plant Load Factor (PLF) for the conventional generation can
be above 85%. Again, the argument is, the changes made violate the policy that
renewable generation is to be promoted by adopting suitable measures for grid
connectivity and sale to any person as per section 86 (1) (e) of the Act. A
case is made out that it has to be borne in mind that there is also levy of
banking charges for the use of the grid to bank and that the OA charges should
be based on the units transacted in the grid and that there is no rationale
for increasing the charges payable from 40% to 50%. It is pointed out that the
State Commission had in the earlier orders for reasons recorded had reduced
level of OA charges and further that the Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission (CERC) has waived the transmission charges etc. in regard to inter-
state system for conveyance of electricity generated from wind sources. Appeal
Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 51 of 80
59\. It is argued that the norms in regard to parameters such as interest on
loan, interest on working capital and O&M expenses have been considered at
lower level ignoring that small wind projects less than 25 MW cannot be
compared with bigger projects. As per WEGs, the capital cost and feed in
tariff (FIT) determined without appropriate parameters and based on higher
capacity utilisation factor is unrealistic.
60\. The WEGs are also aggrieved over retention of the period for payment by
Discoms at sixty days and reduction of liability for delay in payment at 1%
interest from 1.5% per month. The argument is that no justification is
provided for such accommodation to TANGEDCO which results in adverse financial
cash flow to the WEGs.
61\. The impugned order was passed on 13.04.2018 and made effective from
01.04.2018. The WEGs contend this renders the order retrospective and hence
bad.
TAKING STOCK
62\. Our considered view is that the contentions urged by each side of the
divide are partly sound and partly misguided, the approach of the Commission
being half-baked and wholly devoid of Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 52 of 80 any logic, the legislative scheme and
public policy having been violated. There are many a weighty reason for the
banking facility to continue. At the same time, the concerns of the
distribution licensee that the benefit of power banking is costing it dear
cannot be lightly brushed side. There is need to evolve formulae such that it
may be possible for each stakeholder to gain from non-renewable sources like
wind power - a win-win scenario - rather than sulk over being the one to
suffer wrong end of the stick.
63\. Globally, the need for progressive substitution of fossil fuel-
> based generation which leads to global warming by renewable sources
> including wind power has been recognised and various measures have been
> taken. The WPPs are renewable sources of energy, environment friendly (green
> power) and are envisaged to be promoted under the provisions of the
> Electricity Act, 2003 and the National Electricity Policy and National
> Tariff Policy notified by the Central Government in exercise of the powers
> under Section 3 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
64\. From the legislative scheme enshrined in the Electricity Act, 2003,
particularly sections 61(h) and 86(1)(e), it is quite clear that the mandate
to the Regulator is to promote generation of electricity from renewable
sources of energy. Such promotional measures are envisaged in matters of
tariff as well as on matters of connectivity Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of
2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 53 of 80 with the grid and sale to any
person. The reforms brought in through this legislation require consistency
and continuity of public policy thereby promulgated, the thrust areas
including the promotion of renewable energy. In this context, reference needs
to be made to (paragraphs 5.2.20, 5.12, and 5.1.22 of) the vision statement on
the subject of "Non-conventional Energy Sources" in the National Electricity
Policy, 2005:
> "5.2.20 Feasible potential of non-conventional energy resources, mainly
> small hydro, wind and bio-mass would also need to be exploited fully to
> create additional power generation capacity. With a view to increase the

67\. In every such discourse on the subject reference compulsorily comes up to
the close connection between power generation and climate change. In this
context, it is relevant to note that the Government of India has committed
itself to reducing green-house gas emissions, India's climate change policy
having been articulated, inter alia, through National Action Plan on Climate
Change (NAPCC) adopted on 30.06.2008 and India intended Nationally Determined
Commitment (INDC) which was submitted to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 02.10.2015.
68\. The NAPCC has a domestic focus on tackling climate change issues, there
being a specific reference to increase in renewable energy generation capacity
in the country and changing the mix of power so that renewable energy
component becomes more dominant with time. The following part of NAPCC may be
quoted:

72\. The Electricity Act, 2003 was enacted by Parliament under Schedule VII
List 3 Item 38 and as such, the Central Government has the ability to make
policies in a subject matter over which a Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018
and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 60 of 80 Central law has been enacted.
Therefore, the national policies both relating to climate change and governing
electricity sector will have primacy and, as such, the sector Regulator also
has an obligation to implement the same.
73\. It is apt to note here certain observations of this tribunal which are
germane to the issues raised in this lis as recorded in similar dispute that
had emanated from the State of Maharashtra, one of the other States of the
Union that have by commendable promotional measures tapped wind energy. In
Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. Maharashtra
Electricity Regulatory Commission (supra), this tribunal held:
> "24\. The third issue is regarding continuation of banking facility for wind

> ...

75\. We find the claim of TANGEDCO for permanent discontinuance of the banking
facilities to be radically extreme and, patently contrary to the contemporary
letter and spirit of the prevalent law particularly concerning Wind Energy
Resources. There can be no doubt as to the fact that mandate of Section
86(1)(e) of Electricity Act is that renewable sources of energy are to be
promoted and that for such promotion, suitable measures for connectivity with
the grid and sale of electricity to any person are to be adopted, this besides
such measures wherein mandatory quantum purchase of electricity from renewable
sources of energy can be enforced. These aspects are wide enough to include
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 63 of 80
providing connectivity to the grid, open access and evacuation facilities.
76\. The maximisation of renewable power as substitute of fossil fuel
generation is one of the objectives of law and present State policy, the RPO
obligations, envisaged by Section 86(1)(e) being just one mode of achieving
the desired results. It cannot be disputed that wind power projects are
established to operate on long-term basis, generally for periods of more than
twenty-five years. The private players in this field get attracted to
contribute to the cause by setting up projects based on the terms and
conditions that are prevalent at the time of investment, these including
tariff terms and conditions and other facilities such as banking,
connectivity, open access, concessional transmission charges, zero or
concessional rate of cross subsidy surcharge etc. The private investors in the
wind power projects cannot hope to get the desired returns on short-term
operations. In this view of the matter, there is merit in the argument of the
WEGs that it is necessary to maintain continuity of policy and certainty for
the Investor and that it would possibly be unfair and unjust to modify the
terms adverse to its interest during the life of the project.
77\. The State Commission has chosen to maintain the banking facility for the
existing WEGs for twelve months but has made a Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of
2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 64 of 80 modification in the case of new
WEGs by reducing and restricting the banking facility to one month and in the
case of all existing and new WEGs disallowed banking when the generated
electricity is sold to third parties. We do not find any reasons, much less
sufficient, set out in the impugned order for such stipulation. This makes the
impugned order injudicious and consequently unsustainable.
78\. We find substance in the plea of WEGs that wind (as also solar) power is
intermittent generation source and, by its very nature, not available for
continuous availability and end- use/consumption. The quantum of wind velocity
obtainable, which determines the quantum of possible generation, varies
seasonally during periods known as high wind season, low wind season and sub-
marginal wind season. It is this phenomenon which makes it imperative that
banking facility be provided to Wind Power Projects for the whole year. It is
doubtful that a wind power project, including a new project, can operate
effectively with the banking facility being allowed for one month only. The
generation during high wind season cannot be consumed fully in the same month
of generation. It is necessarily required to be banked and consumed in later
seasons. This inherent nature of use of wind generated power has been glossed
over by the State Commission. The one-month period of Appeal Nos. 191, 195 &
265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 65 of 80 banking affects the
fundamentals of functioning of wind power projects providing a consistent
quantum for consumption.
79\. The State Commission could have considered other means to ensure that the
end use or consumption of banked units takes place before the end user chooses
other purchasers; this possibly necessitating effective use of energy
accounting. We have some doubts as to the justification for restricting
banking for sale of electricity to third parties. In terms of Section 49 of
the Electricity Act, the freedom has been given for a generating company to
sell electricity to end-users without the tariff being regulated by the
Regulatory Commission. The statute also provides for non- discriminatory open
access for wheeling or transmission of power from the place of generation to
the place of end use. Section 86 (1)(e) of the Electricity Act provides for
promotion of renewables by adopting suitable measures for connectivity with
the grid and sale of electricity to any person. The end user procuring
electricity from sources other than the distribution licensee of the area is
also an obligated entity for fulfilment of RPO (Renewable Purchase Obligation)
under the regulations notified by the State Commissions in terms of section 86
(1)(e) of the Electricity Act. The denial of banking facility to third party
sale is, therefore, contrary to the above specific provisions and to the
scheme and objective of the Act. Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal
No. 406 of 2019 Page 66 of 80
80\. It appears that the Commission, by the impugned order, has introduced the
questioned modifications because of the constant grouse of TANGEDCO that it
has been affected by the banking facilities being provided to Wind Power
Projects. While consumer interest and financial health of distribution
licensee are important the provisions in regard to third party sale, open
access and renewable energy sources are of equal significance. The Parliament
in its wisdom has considered it necessary that in larger public interest the
environment-friendly sources be promoted by balancing such other interests. In
competing interests, balance has to struck. Moving pendulum-like from one end
to the other is ad-hoc and myopic approach not expected of such high-powered
statutory regulatory authority as TNERC. It is, if we may use such analogy,
akin to stretching the sheet to cover one extremity only to render the other
unjustly uncovered.
81\. There is no foundation laid to support the view that wind power projects
have become so economical as to establish that continued support by such
promotional measures as in question has become undeserved. Similarly, there is
no scrutiny undertaken by the Commission to infer that banking facility is
proving to be too onerous for the distribution licensee making it financially
wholly unviable for it to operate or sustain.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 67 of 80
82\. The Discom TANGEDCO, in the course of hearing on these appeals, did offer
some data through affidavits to demonstrate that the banking facility as it
stood prior to the impugned order (along with such dispensation on ancillary
issues as mentioned earlier) has been unjustly eating into its revenues and,
therefore, not in the interest of consumers at large who would bear the impact
on account of "pass through". The learned counsel for WEGs however argued that
the books of accounts show that instead of losing money the distribution
licensee has actually been the gainer by extending banking facilities to wind
energy generators. Though on our asking a stand was sought to be taken that
clear, sufficient and authenticated statistics was made available to the State
Commission as well at the time of hearing anterior to the impugned order, we
have to assume the contrary to be the position for two reasons - one, no
discussion of such input is reflected in the order which is assailed and, two,
the Commission has expressly stated (in para 10.1.14, quoted verbatim earlier)
that "(i)n the absence of any robust data, Commission is unable to verify the
correctness or otherwise of the claims and counter claims made by them", which
statement, if untrue, would have prompted the TANGEDCO to seek a review.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 68 of 80
83\. We, thus, do not have the advantage of the views of the Commission based
on statistical information. Further, and this tells poorly on the impugned
order, it is clear that the State Commission has taken a view on various
aspects without ascertaining the factual position.
84\. The WEGs also point out procedural infirmity on the part of TNERC. The
facts relating to the Consultative Paper anterior to the issuance of Tariff
order, particularly the only four alternatives in relation to the facility of
banking suggested therein have been noted earlier. The decision arrived at by
the Impugned Order, however, to provide banking facility for twelve months or
one month, on the basis of the date of commissioning before or after
01.04.2018, was not amongst the said alternatives. It is submitted that the
view take caught the WEGs off-guard since they did not have the opportunity to
argue against such conditions, this rendering the procedure non- transparent
and contrary to the dicta in decision of this tribunal given (in Appeal Nos.
197,198 of 2013) on 24.05.2013 mandating wide publicity through consultative
paper before introducing a new rule. Be that as it may, the distinction in
applicability of distinct banking facility depending on date of commissioning
of WPP is inherently contradictory in view of the clause (in Para 3) on
"Applicability" of the Impugned Order itself, which provides that open access
charges Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 69
of 80 and "other terms and conditions", shall be applicable to all the WEGs,
irrespective of their date of commissioning. It is also arbitrary in that it
does not take into account such WEGs as appellant Watsun which falls in grey
zone its project having been commissioned in two phases, clearly for reasons
beyond its control, one on either side of the dividing line (01.04.2018).
85\. In the matter of Fortune Five Hydel Ltd. V. Karnataka Electricity
Regulatory Commission & Ors (Appeal No. 42 of 2018 & batch), this tribunal by
judgment dated 29.03.2019 had rejected the finding of the Karnataka
Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) that "the continuance of the
promotional tariffs and other concessions, which are finally passed on to the
consumers, is no longer justified" and further held that banking is not a sole
commercial transaction but is a physical support to RE generation on account
of generation being infirm and periodical in nature., the following part of
the said decision being germane:
> "14.16 Having regard to the submission made by the learned counsel for the

wherein the need "to carry out a detailed study" was underscored.
87\. As noted earlier, TNERC has been rejecting the request for reduction in
banking period for last several control periods. The impugned order is bereft
of any reason as to why the request of TANGDCO merited acceptance the way it
was done on banking period and ancillary issues. On the contrary, as earlier
noted, the Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page
72 of 80 Commission itself lamented that no "robust data" had been provided.
If so, it should have insisted on supportive material instead of mindlessly
accepting the suggestions ignoring the mandate of law and public policy.
88\. The WEGs submit that as on 31.03.2020, the Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy has pegged the wind potential of Tamil Nadu at 33,799.65 MW whereas the
installed wind generation stands at 9,304.34 MW. It is argued that despite
such low performance of the State, the Commission jumped at the suggestion of
rolling back on incentives and promotional measures of banking without any
analysis regarding the financial implications of such withdrawal which creates
uncertainty for the sector and, therefore, is not conducive for its growth.
All that we wish to say in this regard is that decisions of such import cannot
be taken on current whims or fancies.
89\. We, however, must add that we are not to be misunderstood having rejected
the contentions of TANGEDCO as to financial losses incurred by it due to
banking facility. The difficulty is that this is yet to be established. We are
not inclined to undertake such scrutiny at appellate level without the
advantage of views of the forum of first instance on the data offered to us by
the distribution licensee. We are not impressed with submission that wind
energy Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 73
of 80 capacity has grown optimally so as to render further promotion
unnecessary. We agree and so reiterate what was observed in Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Company Limited v. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory
Commission (supra) that "banking facility should not be at the cost of other
consumers of the Distribution Licensee". There is possibility that the banking
facility is resulting in difficulties for the distribution licensee on account
of "must run" nature of wind power, it consequently causing some instability
of grid and compelling the licensee to ask its other sources (thermal) to back
down, and in the bargain constrained to compensate the latter. All that we are
highlighting here is that the regulatory commissions are under a statutory
mandate to adopt such measures wherein balance is struck and the legislative
objective of encouraging environmentally benign sources is pursued even while
larger consumer interest of availability of quality economical electricity is
protected. These targets, it is clear, are to be aimed at by minimising the
possibility of one interest group feeding at the cost of the other. These
goals cannot be achieved by knee-jerk reactions, or whimsical or arbitrary
unreasoned orders, not the least without the aid of scientific data analysis
of costs involved for all stakeholders.
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 74 of 80
90\. As highlighted in discussion above, several State Commissions have been
struggling to find fair and equitable solutions to the vexed issues arising
from power banking. But we feel the ad hoc approach is more to blame for such
state of affairs. It is not correct to contend that law does not prescribe
power banking to be adopted as a measure. In the case of Tamil Nadu, as noted
earlier in this judgment, the Regulations framed by TNERC (which have the
force of law) do envisage such facility. While we are very clear in our mind
that, so long as the preferential treatment for renewable sources of
electricity is mandated by law and public policy, the benefit of power banking
cannot be taken or wished away, we also acknowledge the need for a fair
dispensation wherein the facility causes minimal disturbance to the economic
interests of other utilities and consumers.
91\. It appears that despite being cajoled, no serious study based on
scientific data has been initiated or undertaken by various State Commissions,
including TNERC, to evolve a fair package on power banking for renewable
sources of energy. We do not know the reasons for such default seemingly
across the board. The reasons may be myriad: lack of sufficient persuasion;
lack of understanding; want of resources; apathy et al. The Regulatory
Commission are expert bodies manned by persons with requisite knowledge and
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 75 of 80
experience. They are equipped with all necessary powers and wherewithal and
such studies should have by now evinced interest. In view of the decision we
intend to render on this batch of appeals, we wish to remind the State
Commission that under Section 86 of Electricity Act, it is also expected to
exercise its powers such that they lead to not only "promote cogeneration and
generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy" but also
"promotion of competition, efficiency and economy" as indeed "promotion of
investment" and "reorganisation and restructuring" of electricity industry. It
is vested with power and authority to frame regulations which have the force
of law. There can be no doubt that in order to carry out its functions and
discharge its responsibility, the Commission should be eager to undertake
studies to help evolve equitable, fair and reasonable uniform principles that
would have continuity and certainty rather than rest content with policies
that remain ad hoc.
92\. Be that as it may, we also feel that since the issues plague the
electricity industry in several States, there is need for uniform policy on
the subject which may have pan-India application. Ideally, the subject would
be better covered in National Electricity Policy and Plan. But that is the
domain of the executive organ (Central Government).
Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 76 of 80
93\. We feel that the Central Electricity Authority, also a creature of the
Electricity Act, can contribute to the cause. After all, it serves in advisory
capacity to the Central Government and, as part of its functions (prescribed
by Section 73), is also competent, inter alia, to "formulate short-term and
perspective plans for development of the electricity system and co-ordinate
the activities of the planning agencies for the optimal utilisation of
resources to subserve the interests of the national economy and to provide
reliable and affordable electricity for all consumers"; to "collect and record
the data concerning the generation, transmission, trading, distribution and
utilisation of electricity and carry out studies relating to cost, efficiency,
competitiveness and such like matters"; to "promote research in matters
affecting the generation, transmission, distribution and trading of
electricity"; and to "carry out, or cause to be carried out, any investigation
for the purposes of generating or transmitting or distributing electricity".
THE RESULT
94\. While deciding these appeals to direct what is deemed necessary and
proper for the parties to do, we request the Central Government to call upon
the Central Electricity Authority to Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and
Appeal No. 406 of 2019 Page 77 of 80 undertake the necessary study and
recommend fair and equitable solutions balancing the competing interests
bearing in mind the legislative scheme and public policy of the State such
that all State Commissions are properly guided.
95\. For the foregoing reasons, we find the impugned order, to the extent
challenged, to be suffering from the vices of being shorn of reasons,
arbitrary, capricious, unjust and inequitable. We, therefore, set aside and
vacate the directions of the State Commission in the impugned order to the
extent it stipulated (a) withdrawal of banking facility (i) for 12 months to
Wind Power Projects commissioned after 31.03.2018 and (ii) altogether for all
existing and new WEGs selling under third party open access sale scheme,
irrespective of date of commissioning; (b) increase in banking charges from
12% to 14%:
(c) increase in cross subsidy surcharge from 50% to 60%: (d) determination of
the capacity utilisation factor at high level of 29.15%: (e) increase in open
access charges from 40% of the normative charges for conventional sources of
power to 50% of transmission and wheeling charges and the basis of levy on the
installed capacity instead of generated units and imposing 100% scheduling and
system operation charges for REC WEGs: (f) fixed feed-in-tariff at Rs.2.86
without accelerated depreciation (AD) and Rs.2.80 with AD without considering
relevant parameters: and (g) Appeal Nos. 191, 195 & 265 of 2018 and Appeal No.
406 of 2019 Page 78 of 80 reduction in liability for delay in Invoice payment
on sale to Discoms category to 1% interest. In the result, the orders on the
above subjects, as prevailing prior to impugned order, shall stand restored
and revived for the control period covered by the impugned order. The State
Commission shall ensure all necessary consequential orders are passed and
these directions are scrupulously complied with by all concerned.
96\. We would not allow further ad hoc approach on the subject. We, thus, also
direct that the State Commission shall not bring about changes in the rules
for power banking (of the kind attempted through the non-speaking impugned
decision) by any further order without undertaking a study based on requisite
data properly gathered and analysed so as to draw informed conclusions about
financial impact on various stakeholders. We are given to understand that
there is sufficient time available for such study before the time for issuing
