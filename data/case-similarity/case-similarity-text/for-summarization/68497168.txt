         This Income Tax Appeal is filed under Section
    260-A of Income Tax Act, 1961 praying to formulate
    the substantial questions of law and to allow the
    appeal and set aside the Order dated 22-04-2010

    1193/BANG/2009 for the assessment year 2002-03.

         These Income Tax Appeals coming on for
    Hearing this day, N. Kumar J., delivered the
    following:
                           JUDGMENT
The revenue has preferred these appeals challenging the order passed by the
Tribunal which has set aside the order passed by the Appellate Commissioner
under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Act').
2\. The assessee in ITA No. 842/2008 filed its return of income for the
assessment year 2002-03 on 31st October, 2002. The same was processed under
Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act. The assessee received notices dated 1st
of April, 2004 under Section 148 of the Act and 12th April 2004 under Section
92CA of the Act from the Transfer Pricing Officer seeking details about the
international transactions entered into by the assessee with the  4 group
companies on a reference made by the Assessing Authority. At the time of issue
of notice under Section 92CA of the Act, no valid return was pending on the
basis of which notice under Section 92CA of the Act could have been issued.
Since no notice under Section 143(2) of the Act was issued pursuant to filing
of the original return, the assessment is deemed to have become final. In
reply to the notice issued under Section 148 of the Act, the assessee filed a
letter dated 21st April, 2004 requesting the Assessing Authority to treat the
return filed on 31-10-2002 as return in compliance with the notice under
Section 148 of the Act. In fact the Transfer Pricing Officer on 20.1.2005
passed an order under Section 92CA of the Act accepting the pricing of the
Assessing Authority. However, the Commissioner of Income Tax invoking his
power under Section 263 of the Act initiated proceedings and set aside the
order of the Assessing Authority on the ground that it is erroneous and
prejudicial to the  5 interest of the revenue. It is against that order, the
assessee preferred an appeal to the Tribunal.
3\. The Tribunal has held that when two views are possible and when the
Transfer Pricing Authority has accepted valuation by the Assessing Authority
determining the arm's length price, the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to
interfere with the said order under Section 263 of the Act and moreover on the
day the reference was made by the Assessing Authority, there was no return
pending for consideration and therefore, the Tribunal has set aside the order
of the Commissioner. It is against the said order, the revenue is before this
Court.
4\. From the aforesaid facts, it is clear that on the day the reference was
made by the Assessing Authority to the Transfer Pricing Authority, there was
no return pending for consideration by him and therefore, the very reference
was bad. Even  6 otherwise, the said Transfer Pricing Authority did not find
fault with the adjudication of determining arms length price by the Assessing
Authority. In those circumstances, the Commissioner committed an error in
exercising his power under Section 263 of the Act and the Tribunal was
justified in interfering with the said order. Therefore, we do not see any
merit in appeal No. 842/2008. Accordingly, it is dismissed.
5\. Consequently, the impugned order which is the subject matter of ITA
339/2010 which is a consequential order is also dismissed.
