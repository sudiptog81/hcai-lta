(g) The final order : Acquitted
(h) The date of such order : 29.08.2009 Brief statement of the reasons for the
decision:-
1\. The above named two accused were sent up for trial in this case for the
offences u/s 63/65/68A of Copyright Act, 1957.
2\. Brief facts of this case are that on 25-10-2004, allegedly, SI Sunil
Kumar, who was posted in IPR Section, EOW, Crime Branch, Delhi received a
secret information regarding manufacturing and sale of infringed VCDs/MP3 by
the shopkeeper of shop no. C-1681, Jahangirpuri, Delhi. It is claimed that
secret information was reduced in writing and seniors were informed.
Subsequently, the information was verified through secret informer once again
and it was found to be correct. On the directions of senior police officers, a
raid was conducted by raiding party comprising SI Sunil Kumar, SI Rakesh, Ct.
Anil Kumar and other police staff under the supervision of Inspector K P
Kukrety. The raiding party reached at Kushal Cinema, Jahangirpuri where 5/6
passersby were requested to become witness but none of them agreed. The
raiding party then reached shop no. C-1681, Jahangirpuri where a shop by the
name Joni Electronics was being run. It is claimed that accused no. 1 Rajender
@ Joni was present in the shop and he was found manufacturing/making infringed
VCDs on a CD JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US:
63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 2 of 17/D writer at the shop having
capacity of 1 x 1. On search of shop, 353 infringed VCDs; 352 infringed MP3
CDs; 1200 inlay cards and one CD writer having capacity of 1 x 1 along with
one UPS were recovered. What is interesting is that it is not mentioned that
any computer was recovered from the shop although recovery of one CD writer
and one UPS is shown to have been effected. These CDs were claimed to be
infringed and were also allegedly lacking mandatory particulars u/s 52A of
Copyright Act, 1957 therefore they were seized by keeping them in one gunny
bag and sealing it with the seal of "SKJ". Seal after use was handed over to
Ct. Anil.
3\. It is the further the case of prosecution that pursuant to disclosure of
accused no. 1 Rajender @ Joni, raiding party reached the house of second
accused Gopal Sharma at H. No. B-1856, Jahangirpuri, Delhi at first floor
where second accused Gopal Sharma was present and, from the said house, 663
infringed VCDs/MP3 were recovered. Allegedly, they were also not containing
any mandatory particulars as required u/s 52A of Copyright Act, 1957. It is
further the case of the prosecution that from the house of second accused
Gopal Sharma, 45 blank CDs; 750 inlay cards and 1 x 7 CD writer make Sony were
also recovered. All these articles were kept in two gunny bags which were
given Sl. no. 1 and 2 and after sealing the gunny bags with the seal of "SKJ"
they were taken into police possession. On completion of investigation,
chargesheet was filed.
4\. My Ld. Predecessor court framed charges u/s 63, 65 and 68A of Copyright
Act, 1957 against both the accused to which both accused claimed trial.
5\. In support of its case, prosecution examined five witnesses JUDGMENT/State
Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 3 of 17/D namely PW1 HC Govind Singh, PW2 Gurdeep
Singh, PW3 HC Anil Kumar, PW4 SI Rajeev Bhardwaj and PW5 SI Sunil Jain.
6\. All the incriminating evidence which came against the accused was put to
the accused in their examination under Sec 313 read with Sec 281 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure to which accused generally denied the evidence against
them and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case. Accused
persons did not opt to lead defence evidence in their favour.
7\. I have heard Ld. APP for State and counsel for accused and perused the
record.
8\. Out of five witnesses examined by the prosecution, PW1 HC Govind Singh was
a formal witness who was Duty officer on 25-10-2004 at PS Jahangirpuri and he
proved the FIR as Ex. PW1/A.
9\. PW2 Gurdeep Singh was a public witness who deposed that there are four
shops in the premises no. C-1681, allegedly where in one of the shops, accused
Rajender @ Joni was running business of infringement. This witness deposed
that his shop no. is 2, in shop no. C-1681, Jahangirpuri, Delhi the accused
Rajender was also running TV repair shop. The witness deposed in the cross-
examination that accused Rajender was having TV repair shop only and he know
it quite well since the door of his shop is exactly opposite the shop of the
accused. This witness deposed that he never saw the accused selling any kind
of CD etc at the said shop. Accordingly, this witness did not support the case
of prosecution at all and instead deposed against the case of prosecution.
Despite his specifically deposing that accused Rajender was never selling CDs,
this witness was not re-examined or cross-examined by JUDGMENT/State Vs.
Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 4 of 17/D Prosecutor even though the witness did not
support the case of prosecution itself who examined this witness in its
favour.
10\. PW3 HC Anil Kumar, PW4 SI Rajeev Bhardwaj and PW5 SI Sunil Jain are all
police witnesses who deposed in favour of the prosecution and supported the
case of prosecution. It is deposed by PW3 and PW5 that when they reached the
shop of accused Rajender, he was preparing CDs with the help of CD writer. No
CDs which were allegedly being copied on the CD writer at the time of raid
was, admittedly, separately sealed by the Investigating Agency. Similarly, no
master CDs with the help of which copies were being prepared were so
separately sealed. Therefore, the prosecution could not show any CDs to the
Court which were allegedly being prepared by the accused at the time of raid.
If the prosecution wants this Court to believe that accused was preparing CDs
and copying the same at the time of raid, it was least expected from the
prosecution to have separately seized the CDs being copied and the CDs through
which it was being copied to show to the court. But it was not done. This
assumes significance particularly when there is no public witness joined in
this case and PW2 Gurdeep Singh deposed that he never saw selling of any CDs
by the accused from his shop which was located opposite the shop of this
witness.
11\. What is interesting is that it is claimed that one CD writer was
recovered from the shop of Rajender and one UPS was also recovered, but in the
seizure memo Ex. PW3/A or even in the rukka it is nowhere mentioned that any
computer was also recovered from his shop. One fails to understand as to how
the CD writer can work without computer. No such computer was produced in the
court, when case property Ex.
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 5 of 17/D P1 was proved, in the evidence against the
accused Rajender. This fact demolishes the case of Prosecution regarding
copying of CDs by the accused Rajender.
12\. It is nobody's case that accused Rajender had displayed the infringed
articles in the shop for the purpose of sale/hire/letting. No such thing is
mentioned in the testimony of PW3 HC Anil or PW5 SI Sunil. It is not the case
of Prosecution that any of these CDs were displayed for sale or they were so
offered for sale or hire. It is nobody's case that anybody purchased any CD
from the said shop. Even the details of those 353 + 352 CDs which were
allegedly recovered from the shop of accused Rajender is not mentioned or
recorded. This fact is neither recorded anywhere nor proved that whether there
were more than one VCD of the same movie or same songs which could have given
rise to an inference by the court that CDs were meant for sale or
letting/hire.
13\. Section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 makes punishable an offence of
infringement when a person knowingly infringes the copyright in a work. The
word 'knowing infringes' is of great significance, which requires active mens
rea present.
14\. In the case of 1994 CRI. L. J. 2469 in the case of A. K.
Mukherjee v. State hon'ble DELHI HIGH COURT held as follows;
" 8. A bare perusal of the provision would go to show that emphasis is on the
words "knowingly infringes.... the Copyrights in a work." These words clearly
postulate a knowledge on the part of the accused that he was infringing the
Copyright in a work. Mere possibility of his having known it would not
suffice. There has to be clear and conclusive proof of the requisite
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 6 of 17/D knowledge. Even the existence of reasonable
means of knowing would not be enough. In short thus the use of the work
"knowingly" in the provision results in requiring "mens rea in the full sense"
[See Prof. J.C. Smity, "The Guilty Mind in the Criminal Law" 1960 Law
Quarterly Review Vo. 76,p. 79]. This in short being the legal requirement
under Section 63 of the Copy-right Board, evidence shall have to be led to
bring home the required guilty knowledge."
15\. Infringement is defined in Section 51 of Copyright Act and it states that
Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed when any person, without a
licence granted by the owner of the copyright or, by Registrar of Copyrights
does anything, the exclusive rights to do which is by the Act conferred upon
the owner of the copyright of the said Act. It further provides that copyright
shall be deemed to be infringed if any person, makes for sale or hire, or
sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade displays or offers for sale or hire
any infringing copies of the work. It also provides that when any person
distributes for the purposes of trade any infringing copies, it shall be
deemed infringement. Admittedly, Clause (a) Section 51 and sub clause (iii)
and
(iv) of Clause (b) of section 51 are not applicable in this case.
16\. What are the exclusive rights of a copyright holder, is defined in
Section 14 (1) (d), in the case of cinematograph film, and it says that
copyright in a cinematograph film means, exclusive rights to make copy of film
including the photographs of an image; to sell or give on hire or offer for
sale or hire any copy of the film; and to communicate the film to the public.
Similarly, section 14 (1) (e) provides the exclusive rights given to a
copyright holder, in case of sound recording. Therefore in order to prove
infringement it was incumbent on the JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni &
Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 7 of 17/D
prosecution to show that accused did anything, the exclusive rights to which
vested with the copyright holder, or, the prosecution ought to have proved
that accused sold or gave on hire or by way of trade displayed or offered for
sale or hire the infringing copies.
17\. Although it is deposed by PW3 and PW5 that when they reached the shop of
accused Rajender, he was preparing CDs with the help of CD writer. No CDs
which were allegedly being copied on the CD writer at the time of raid was,
admittedly, separately sealed by the Investigating Agency. Similarly, no
master CDs with the help of which copies were being prepared were so
separately sealed. Therefore, the prosecution could not show any CDs to the
Court which were allegedly being prepared by the accused at the time of raid.
If the prosecution wants this Court to believe that accused was preparing CDs
and copying the same at the time of raid, it was least expected from the
prosecution to have separately seized the CDs being copied and the CDs through
which it was being copied to show to the court. But it was not done. This
assumes significance particularly when there is no public witness joined in
this case and PW2 Gurdeep Singh deposed that he never saw selling of any CDs
by the accused from his shop which was located opposite the shop of this
witness. The prosecution failed to prove it in the evidence that accused made
a copy of any of the cinematograph films or sound recording since no such
VCDs/CDs, which were being reproduced, is proved in evidence. Section 63 of
the Copyright Act provides that there should be a knowing infringement of the
copyright.
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 8 of 17/D
18\. So far as recovery of inlay cards are concerned, mere recovery of inlay
cards does not amount to infringement within the definition of infringement as
mentioned above. In the case of cinematograph films, it is only when a
photograph of any image forming part of the cinematograph film is reproduced,
that infringement can be alleged. It is nobody's case that any of the inlay
cards contain photograph of any image of cinematograph film. It was incumbent
on the prosecution to have proved as to which photograph of which of the
alleged inlay cards was photograph of an image of which cinematograph film. In
the absence of such evidence, prosecution cannot expect this court to presume
that inlay cards recovered from the accused were containing photographs of any
image of the film. What is interesting is that in the entire prosecution
evidence, no evidence has come on record as to which cinematograph film or
which sound recording had a copyright with whom.
19\. Can there be any infringement in respect of inlay cards which is used to
pack the cassettes in the cassette covers and which contains the names of
songs and may contain photos of actors and movie. If yes, what part of inlay
cards which are so used in packing and selling the audio cassettes can be
called as infringed?
20\. Admittedly, an inlay card which may contain the name of cinematograph
film/movie or the name of songs and which may also contain photograph of any
image of the cinematograph film is a mechanically printed paper. There cannot
be any iota of doubt that the name of cinematograph film /movie or the name of
songs does not by itself gets any protection from being reproduced. There is
no Copyright in the name of cinematograph film /movie or in the title of
songs. The name of cinematograph film /movie or title of songs JUDGMENT/State
Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 9 of 17/D cannot be called literary work either.
21\. Even otherwise as per judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
AIR 1986 DELHI 444 "Camlin Private Ltd. v. M/s. National Pencil Industries" ,
there cannot be any infringement of a copyright in the any artistic work
allegedly claimed on a mechanically printed paper. In that case the question
was whether use of word "National Elora" on cartons of defendants give any
cause of action to plaintiffs for infringement of their copyright or trade
mark "Camlin Flora". The plaintiffs claim was that he is the owner of
copyright in the floral design that appears on its printed cartons/boxes and
that the defendant's cartons bearing the word "National Elora" in connection
with their pencils are passing off their goods as goods of the plaintiff. The
plaintiff's trade mark was in respect of fountain pens, pencils etc. in terms
of certificate of registration in two words "Camlin Flora" and the carton is a
machine printed carton made of some kind of paper board. It was held that ,
"In order to be covered by the Copyright Law, any work in which copyright is
claimed must originate from the author who must have expended his skill and
labour and the work must be something which has not been copied by the author
from any one else. It is only then that it can be said that it has
"originated" from the author.
It was also held that, " In the present case, the printed cartons/boxes appear
to be mechanically reproduced one. It cannot be said that any skill or labour
has been expended upon the allegedly artistic carton, as the same has been
produced by mechanical actions of a printing machine, and not by skill and
labour having been expended upon them by JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni &
Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 10 of 17/D
any natural person. Further, the boxes/cartons in question are not "engraving"
as contained in S.2(i). Any print obtained from either on offset printing
process or by a letter press or in combination of the various printing process
including silk printing process cannot amount to an engraving. (Paras 26, 28)
22\. Section 14 of The Copyright Act, so far as applicable for our case, would
show that a copyright means the exclusive rights of copyright holder to make a
copy of the cinematograph film and it shall include the photograph of any
image forming part thereof. Therefore to call an inlay card an infringed copy
what must be shown by the prosecution is that photograph, if any, appearing on
the inlay cards, recovered from the accused were photographs of any image
forming part of the cinematograph film of the copyright holder. Admittedly, in
the entire prosecution evidence there is nothing to directly or indirectly
suggest that any of the inlay cards recovered from the two accused were having
photograph of the image of any such cinematograph film. Even if it is admitted
that inlay cards recovered from the accused were containing name of movies and
the titles of the songs of the cinematograph films belonging to some other
copyright holder, the same by itself would not amount to infringement within
the definition of infringement as discussed above. Therefore, on that short
legal ground, there is no infringement so far as inlay cards are concerned.
23\. As mentioned above, prosecution even did not thought it proper to take
details of the VCDs/CDs recovered to show to this Court that any of the VCDs
which were recovered from the possession of accused were more than one copy of
any single work. In the absence of any proof by the prosecution that accused
was found in possession of more JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR
NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 11 of 17/D than one
copies of any cinematograph film or sound recording, infringement is difficult
to presume against the accused. Therefore, even if the allegations of the
prosecution, that accused was found in possession of these articles, are per
se taken to be proved, the offence of infringement is not made out. Mere
possession of VCDs/CDs of cinematograph films and sound recordings are not
offences within the definition of infringement u/s 51 of Copyright Act, 1957
unless they are offered for sale or displayed for sale or hire or unless they
are reproduced.
24\. Coming to accused Gopal Sharma, admittedly, the place which was raided
was house of Gopal. It was not a commercial premises. It is not nobody's case
that accused Gopal was reproducing any VCDs/CD. It is also nobody's case that
any such VCD/CDs were sold by him. As I have already discussed above , mere
possession of VCDs which can be for personal use even though those may be
infringed copies, is not an offence of infringement, within the definition of
section 63 Copyright Act.
25\. Coming to the second charge of Section 68A of Copyright Act, 1957, the
same is also not made out against any of the two accused for the reason that
it is nobody's case that cinematograph films and sound recordings were
published within the meaning of section 3 of Copyright Act.
26\. Section 52A of Copyright Act, 1957 provides that no person shall publish
a sound recording in respect of any work unless particulars as mentioned in
Sub-section (1) Clause (a) i.e. name and address of the person who made the
sound recording; name and address of the owner of the copyright in such work;
and year of its first publication are JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni &
Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 12 of 17/D
displayed on the sound recording or any container thereof.
27\. The necessary ingredient of section 52A of Copyright Act is publication
of a sound recording and when these particulars are lacking, a person shall be
guilty for 68A of Copyright Act.
28\. What is publication is defined in Section (3) of the Copyright Act, 1957
and it says, that for the purposes of this Act, "publication" means making a
work available to the public by issue of copies or by communicating the work
to the public.
29\. The word communication of a work to the public is defined in Section 2
(ff) of the Act which says that "Communication to the public" means making any
work available for being seen or hear or otherwise enjoyed by the public
directly or by any means of display or diffusion other than by issuing copies
of such work regardless of whether any member of the public actually sees,
hears, or otherwise enjoys the work so made available.
30\. In the present case, admittedly none of the VCD/CD allegedly recovered
from the possession of accused were published within the meaning of section 2
(ff) and section 3 of the Act. Nor accused is alleged to have issued any
copies thereof to the public.
31\. In the case of accused Gopal Sharma also, section 68A of Copyright Act,
1957 does not get attracted since even he was no publishing sound recording.
The case property which was recovered from the possession of accused Gopal
Sharma was recovered from residential house.
32\. In such circumstance, when there is no publication of these CDs by the
accused, necessary ingredient of section 52A of the copyright is not fulfilled
and therefore charge u/s 68A of the Copyright Act is JUDGMENT/State Vs.
Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US: 63/65/68A CR Act
/Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 13 of 17/D not proved and the accused is acquitted
for the offence u/s 68A of Copyright Act, 1957.
33\. Coming to the third charge u/s 65 of the Copyright Act, 1957, all that
prosecution has proved against the accused Rajender that he was found in
possession of one CD writer and one UPS. I have already mentioned above that
it is not the case of prosecution that any computer was recovered from the
possession of accused Rajender. It is anybody's guess as to how the CD writer
without a computer can work. Possession of CD writer by itself does not amount
to any offence within the definition of section 65 of Copyright Act since what
must be shown is that such duplicating equipment was used or it was intended
to be used for infringement. In the absence of any computer, it can't be
claimed by the prosecution that CD writer was used or it's intended to be used
for duplicating.
34\. However, against accused Gopal Sharma, regarding charge u/s 65 of
Copyright Act, the case of the prosecution is that from his possession one CD
writer having a capacity of 1 x 7 simultaneous reproduction was recovered with
45 blank CDs. Although even from the possession of this accused also the
Investigating Agency did not collect any CD which were so being reproduced nor
are the details of CDs mentioned.
35\. Admittedly, as deposed by PW3 HC Anil Kumar there was no computer in the
shop of accused Rajender and the computer was brought from a neighbour. It is
so mentioned in the cross-examination of witness thereby meaning that there
was no computer in the shop of accused Rajender and it is known fact that CD
writer cannot run without computer since it requires software to run the CD
writer. IN JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US:
63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 14 of 17/D such circumstances, it
cannot be claimed by prosecution that duplicating equipments recovered from
the accused Rajender i.e. CD writer was used or intended to be used for
infringement. Needless to say that no such computer was seized by the police
nor was it ever produced in the evidence. Similarly, from the premises of
accused Gopal Sharma, no computer was recovered and only one CD writer with
one UPS is shown to have been recovered. There is no evidence which has come
on record to show that accused Gopal Sharma was recording any CDs/VCDs at the
time of raid. Admittedly, as admitted by PW3 HC Anil Kumar in his cross-
examination, accused Gopal opened the door when the door was knocked. In such
circumstances, there was no occasion for the prosecution witness to have seen
that accused Gopal Sharma was recording any CD. Even otherwise, all that is
alleged against the accused Gopal Sharma by PW3 in his cross-examination is
that he was packing infringed articles. IN the absence of any computer, it is
anybody's guess as to how CD writer can function. PW5 SI Sunil Jain also
deposed that Gopal Sharma was not found preparing any CD at the time of
apprehension. No such computer is seized or produced in evidence. Therefore
for the foregoing reasons even charges u/s 65 of Copyright Act does not
sustain against accused Gopal Sharma.
36\. Besides this, there is non-compliance of section 64 of Copyright Act. The
Copyright Act 1957, in the Sec 64, specifically provides that whenever any
search and seizure is effected by an investigating officer pertaining to
infringed articles, the said recovered infringed articles should be produced
immediately before a class one magistrate. The word used in the Sec is "shall"
which makes it mandatory. But in the present case admittedly the case property
was not produced JUDGMENT/State Vs. Rajender @ Joni & Anr./FIR NO. 778/04/US:
63/65/68A CR Act /Acquitted/29.08.09/Page 15 of 17/D before the class one
magistrate immediately after its seizure.
37\. No independent witness has been joined by the prosecution and there is
absolute non compliance of section 100 of Cr.P.C. Sub Sec 4 of Sec 100 of the
Criminal Procedure Code specifically provides that whenever any search or
seizure is effected by an investigating officer, the investigating officer
before making search or seizure shall join at least two independent
respectable local inhabitants from the same locality in which search is to be
effected. Again the word used in sub Sec 4 of Sec 100 is "shall" which makes
it mandatory. An investigating officer is granted liberty to join independent
witnesses from other locality only when the witnesses from the same locality
are either not available or they refuse to become witness. It appears that no
sincere effort was made to join local respectable witness from the same
locality before making search and seizure .
