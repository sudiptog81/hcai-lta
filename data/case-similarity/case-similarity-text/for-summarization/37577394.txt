          This appeal of the assessee      is directed against the order of
dated 06/09/2017 of CIT(A) - 2, Hyderabad, for AY 2013-14.
2\. Brief facts of the case are that assessee company engaged in the business
of handling and treatment and disposal of the Bio - medical waste (hazardous
waste), filed its return of income for the AY 2013-14 through electronic
filing on 29/09/2013, declaring total income of Rs. 1,31,53,090/- before
claiming deduction u/s 80IA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and nil income after
claiming deduction u/s 80IA of the Act under normal provisions and MAT income
of Rs. 1,36,21,883/-. Subsequently, the case was selected for scrutiny under
CASS and accordingly notice u/s 143(2) of the Act and served on the assessee.
In response to the said notice, the AR of the assessee filed the required
information.

ITA No. 1852 /Hyd/2017 GJ Multiclave (India) Pvt. Ltd.
2.1 The AO observed that the assessee company has set up common treatment and
disposal facility for handing Bio - medical/hazardous W astes generated from
various health care establishments. The company is handling projects at three
location/ sites viz., Thenmelpakkam Village, Chengalpattu Taluk, Kancheepuram
district, Tamil Nadu, Edupally Village, Mahaboobnagar district, Andhra
Pradesh, and Manthuruthy, Kanjikode, Pallakad district, Kerala.
2.2 During the year under consideration, the assessee company shown profits
from Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu units, whereas shown losses from Kerala
Unit. AO was of the view that this act of the company was suspicious as during
the A.Y. 2012 -13 the profits earned from Kerala unit were disallowed due to
non -availability of approvals issued by the Pollution Control Board of Kerala
Government. Keeping in view the assessee company had veiled its profits and
shown losses from the Kerala unit. To verify the genuineness of the assessee
company claims, the books of accounts of the assessee company in particular
the books of accounts of the Kerala unit was called for and examined. During
the examination it is found most of the expenditure claimed as cash
expenditure, which is susceptible for verification. The AR was asked to
explain why these payments should not be disallowed. The AR stated that in
thes e unit operations especially the nature of business cash payments in
petty nature is unavoidable. As the company consistently declared profits
before disallowance was made during A.Y. 2012 -13. To give a fair treatment
and meet the ends of justice, the Kera la profits for F.Y. 2012-13 are
estimated on the lines of profit declared during F.Y. 2011-12 which was 4.3%
on the gross receipts. At this rate the Kerala unit profits are worked out to
Rs. 37,16,236/-. In the absence of approval from the Pollution Control Board
of Kerala Govt. in the name of the assessee, the AO disallowed the said
amount.

ITA No. 1852 /Hyd/2017 GJ Multiclave (India) Pvt. Ltd.
2.3 The AO also disallowed an amount of Rs. 6,36,826/ - towards EPF and ESI
remittance of employees contribution on the ground that the same were remitted
beyond due date.
3\. Aggrieved by the order of AO, the assessee preferred an appeal before the
CIT(A).
4\. The CIT(A) confirmed the disallowance made by the AO u/s 80IA(4) following
the decision of his predecessor in the case of assessee for AY 2012-13 and
also confirmed the disallowance made u/s 36(1)(va).
5\. Aggrieved by the order of CIT(A), the assessee is in appeal before us.
6\. Assessee has raised 7 grounds of appeal. Ground Nos. 1 to 4 are pertaining
to disallowance u/s 80IA and ground No. 5 & 6 are pertaining to disallowance
u/s 36(1)(va). In ground No. 7, the assessee submitted that the issues under
dispute are covered by the decision of the ITAT in assessee's own case for AY
2010-11 and 2012-13 in ITA No. 448 & 1540/Hyd/2016 order dated 21/06/2017.
7\. Before us, the ld. AR of the assessee invited our attention to the paper
book wherein various documents, namely, copies of agreements between the
assessee and the Indian Medical Association and copies of approvals from
Kerala State Pollution Control Board and other documents in support of
assessee's claim.
8\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, relied on the orders of revenue
authorities.
9\. Considered the rival submissions and perused the mate rial on record. W e
find that similar issue came up for consideration before the SMC-B Bench bench
in assessee's own case for AY 2010-11 and 2012-12 (supra) wherein the SMC-B
Bench remitted the matter back to the file of the AO by observing as under:
4
> ITA No. 1852 /Hyd/2017 GJ Multiclave (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> "10. I have perused the orders and heard the rival contentions. In my
> opinion, it is appropriate to remit the entire issue back to the file of the
> ld. AO to examine the issue afresh after considering the contract documents
> as a whole and all other evidence that may be submitted by the assessee to
> demonstrate the facts that actual work was executed by the assessee and
> IMAGE did not claim any deduction u/s 80IA of the Act. I set aside the order
> of CIT(A) and direct the AO to decide the issue afresh after considerin g
> the ratio laid down in the list of cases at para 6 hereinabove. Needless to
> mention that ld. AO shall afford reasonable opportunity of being heard to
