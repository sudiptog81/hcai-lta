    CORAM:
    MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT
    1.
         Whether the Reporters of local papers         YES
           may be allowed to see the judgment?
    2.     To be referred to Reporter or not?            YES
    3.     Whether the judgment should be                YES
           reported in the Digest?
photographs relied on by Servewell, in support of its claim for infringement
of design, prima facie, reveal that the designs are the same. In these
circumstances, the Court is of opinion that Dolphin has a reasonably arguable
case in support of its contention that the design registration is liable to be
challenged. Of course, these observations are tentative, and based on the
existing materials; the parties are yet to test their respective strengths in
the trial, in this case. Consequently, the Court is of the view that the
injunction vis-Ã - vis the registered design cannot be granted.
22\. As a result of the above discussion, it is held that the subsisting
interim order has to be vacated. The injunction in respect of the artistic
works, which have been registered by the first plaintiff, is hereby vacated.
Likewise, the injunction in respect of Design No. 217625 is hereby vacated.
Resultantly, the defendant is permitted to open the seals in respect of all
the products I.A. No. 383/2010 (the plaintiffs' application under Order XXXIX
Rules 1 & 2) is dismissed and I.A. No. 1119/2010 (Dolphin's application for
vacation for stay) is therefore allowed. No costs.
           reported in the Digest?
    MR. JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT
1\. This is an order deciding two applications, i.e. I.A. No. 383/2010 (of
plaintiffs under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2) and I.A. No. 1119/2010 (of Defendant
under Order XXXIX Rule 4) in Suit No. 49/2010, seeking permanent injunction
under section 51 and 55 of the Copyright Act, 1957 read with section 22 of the
Designs Act, 2000 restraining infringement of registered design, copyright and
passing off by the defendant.
2\. The suit states that the first and the second plaintiffs (hereafter
jointly, "Servewell") are sister concerns, as they are controlled by members
of the same family. It is further stated that the first plaintiff came into
existence more than a decade ago, whereas the second plaintiff was established
on 01.04.2005. Servewell are engaged in the business of designing, developing,
manufacturing marketing and exporting domestic kitchen appliances, melamine
decorative IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 1 serving trays
and tableware. It is claimed that they have manufactured and marketed the
above said goods in scores of different shapes, sizes, designs and artistic
works, which, according to them, have been well received by the consumers. The
first plaintiff claims to be the owner of almost all intellectual property
rights of the group and the second plaintiff is aggressively manufacturing and
marketing the aforementioned goods in domestic, as well as international
market. Servewell claims that their business is well-known for superior
quality, durability and unique attractive artwork depicted on their products
sold under their distinctive trademark "SERVEWELL".
3\. It is stated that, as a part of promotional activities, in 2005 Servewell
commissioned the services of one Mr. Bhupendra Chotalia, a commercial artist
to design art works for calendar and greeting cards for the year 2006, to be
distributed among stockists and distributors. The copyright in the said art
works vests in the first plaintiff, by assignment. It is stated that the
second plaintiff, using the said artistic works launched its first line of
products. The suit avers that this product line was a resounding success in
domestic and international market, this prompted the first plaintiff to
approach the Registrar of Copyrights, New Delhi for registration of said
artistic works, which are now duly registered in the first plaintiff's name
under nos. A- 84938/09, A-84939/09, A-84940/09, A-84941/09, A-84942/09,
84943/09, A-84944/09, A- 84945/09 and A-84946/09. Again in the year 2008 the
first plaintiff got some artistic works executed by the same author, which too
were registered in its name under nos. A-84918/09 and A-84919/09. Copies of
all the above said certificates have been filed. In 1st week of August, 2008
the first plaintiff claims to have invented a new/novel design of serving tray
having a unique shape and configuration, which was duly registered on
11.08.2008 with the Controller of Designs under no. 217625; a copy of the
certificate is filed. The first plaintiff permitted the second plaintiff to
manufacture and market serving trays under the said new/unique design and
incorporating all/any of the above mentioned artistic works.
4\. In support of its contention about enjoying a widespread reputation in the
market for its product, Servewell has, in Para 11 of the suit, reproduced its
total turnover figures; in 2006-07, its turnover was Rs. 5,05,94,000/-; it
increased to Rs. 12,19,13,000/- for the year 2008-09. Servewell contends that
its serving trays are distributed through 16 branches, and sales depots,
throughout the world; it also states possessing distribution networks in 53
cities, across the IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 2
country. The suit alleges that Servewell participates in international fairs
and that its goods are retailed in well known stores, and malls.
5\. The suit claims permanent injunction, and consequential relief, against
the defendant (hereafter "Dolphin") for alleged infringement in respect of
registered artistic works displayed in trays marketed by the latter (i.e.
Dolphin), which are identical replicas of the artistic works found in the
trays marketed by Servewell. The copyright in these artistic works is the
subject matter of copyright registrations in A-84918/09, A-84919/09
A-84938/09, A-84939/09, A-84940/09, A- 84941/09, A-84942/09, 84943/09,
A-84944/09, A-84945/09 and A-84946/09. Servewell also claims that Dolphin has
infringed their design in respect of the shape of the tray, which is the
subject matter of design registration No. 217625.
6\. This Court, at the stage of first hearing of the suit, while issuing
summons, made the following interim order, on the application for ex-parte ad-
interim injunction, as well as the application for appointment of a local
commissioner:
> "I.A. No. 383/2010 (Under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2) Issue notice to the

> In support, the plaintiffs have produced photographs of the two products.

> Commissioner will be paid a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand) apart

> Local Commissioner shall submit his reports to the Court within two weeks."
7\. The report of the local commissioner, dated 29th January, 2010 states,
inter alia, that 805 goods bearing the Servewell's registered design, with or
without the copyright were found, and that 1019 goods, bearing the copyright
were also found. 147 cartons, bearing Servewell's copyright, were found. The
commissioner took photographs, which are annexed to the report.
8\. Servewell argues that the copyright in the artworks, which are embodied in
the trays, have been slavishly reproduced by Dolphin, in the trays sold by the
latter. It is submitted that the IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS)
49/2010 Page 4 so called changes urged by Dolphin, do not obscure the slavish
reproduction of the essential artistic works, in all the products or goods,
and that the written statement does not disclose any legitimate defense. It is
urged that Dolphin - which relies on some catalogues, to say that four designs
of the plaintiffs, are not original works, but are themselves copied from
other existing material- possesses copyright not only in respect of those
features (assuming them to be unoriginal, as they are flowers) but in the
entire artwork. Servewell submits that the author or creator of the artistic
works, Chotalia, had originally made them for use in calenders and such like
works, but had assigned the copyrights by the deed, dated 27.05.2006. As a
consequence, the copyright registrations were accepted in favour of Servewell,
in 2009. It is submitted that there is a minor mistake in description, in
respect of one of the works. Servewell urges that the overall artistic work is
to be seen, rather than the minute differences such as changes in the colour,
of the impugned work, to discern whether the copyright is infringed.
9\. Learned counsel for Servewell submits that whereas there can be no quarrel
with the argument that those elements in nature can be reproduced- such as
flowers- yet the creativity of an artist, by the use of such elements, bearing
his originality, in the use of other devices, such as colour bars, their
positioning in the artistic work, are protected by copyright, which cannot be
reproduced, except with the consent and authorization of the copyright
proprietor. Therefore, the defendant's submission, based on existence of such
flowers, in some catalogues, is untenable. The reproduction of such flowers or
floral designs, in combination with the unique manner of presentation of the
colours in the background, constitutes infringement of the original artistic
works, which has to be restrained, through a temporary injunction. Servewell
relies on the decision reported as The Daily Calender, Supplying Bureau v. The
United Concern, AIR 1967 Mad 381, to say that exact reproduction of an
artistic work is not to establish copyright infringement, but the showing of
the impugned mark, copying essential elements of the copyrighted work.
10\. In Daily Calender, the Madras High Court stated that:
> "For the purpose of infringement of copyright, an exact reproduction of
> substantial part or copy is not necessary. What is essential is to see
> whether there is a reproduction of substantial part of the picture. There
> can be no test to decide what a substantial part of a picture is. One useful
> test, which has been followed in several decisions of courts, is the one
> laid down by Lord Herschel, LC, in Banfstaengl v- Baines & Co 1895 AC 20:
> IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 5 "..it depends really
> on the effect produced upon the mind by a study of the picture, and of that
> which is alleged to be a copy of it, or at least of its design."
> .............. .......................
> There might be and there will be obvious differences deliberately introduced
> to avoid a possible charge of infringement. A bad copy does not cease to be
> a copy. If the court, on a consideration of all the relevant circumstances
> and a comparison of the plaintiff's picture and the infringing picture comes
> to the conclusion that the defendant's picture was consciously copied from
> the work of the plaintiff, that would be sufficient to hold that copyright
> is infringed."
11\. Servewell urges, as far as the case concerning design infringement is
concerned, that there is no room for doubt about Dolphin's intention. Reliance
is placed on the local commissioner's report, and it is contended that once
the design owner establishes that the novelty in the design (in this case, the
shape of the tray) is protected by registration, there is no question of
having to satisfy any other test. The test of deceptive similarity, or overall
comparison to discern substantiality, etc., are apt in trademark passing off
actions; for a design infringement action, the plaintiff merely has to show
that he is owner of the registered design, and that it is copied by the
defendant, which has been done, in this case. Servewell relies on the decision
reported as Castrol Ltd v. Tide Water Oil Co., 1996 PTC 16 (Cal) in support of
this submission. It is submitted that the defendant's argument about existence
of prior art, taken in the written statement, cannot stand scrutiny, since
only photographs have been produced, and not any object in material or three
dimensional form.
12\. Dolphin contests the suit; it has filed a written statement, and also
filed an application for vacation of the ad-interim order, made by the Court.
Its contention is that the artistic works, in which copyright proprietorship
is claimed, are not protectable under the Copyright Act, since the main or
dominant feature, i.e. the floral representations, had been published
previously. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on photographs
from books and catalogues. They are described in detail as follows:
    IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010                                                Page 6

It is argued that the three floral designs used by Servewell for its trays are
neither original nor works of art, as they merely copy prior publications.
Dolphin also says that the floral designs are, in any case not entitled to
copyright protection, since they do not satisfy the test of original artistic
works, as there is no creative element. Dolphin relies on the recent ruling of
the Supreme Court, in Eastern Book Co. v. D.B. Modak, 2008 (1) SCC 1. It is
submitted that copyright registration does not in any manner affect the right
of Dolphin to submit that the works in question are not copyrightable, or
entitled to copyright protection, unlike in the case of trademark
registration.
13\. Dolphin challenges the design registration of Servewell in respect of the
trays in question, and states that by virtue of Section 22(3) of the Designs
Act, 2000 (hereafter "the 2000 Act") the Court can independently conclude that
the controller of designs could not have registered the design(s) in question,
for any of the reasons enumerated under Section 19, enabling cancellation (of
such design registration). In this case, says Dolphin, there is no novelty or
uniqueness in the tray design, as what is urged to be so novel is fairly
commonplace. Besides, says Dolphin, Annexure-E (Collectively) - at page 103 (
in support of I.A. 1119/2010) reveals that the so- called uniqueness of the
shape, which is the angled sides of the tray, styled distinctly, and
convenient for holding by the hand, existed in catalogues printed by an
Italian company. It is also submitted that the said design is known as
"trendy" and was existing, and marketed as such, IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010
in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 7 openly, even before the design was registered. Copies
of certain invoices issued by Premier Marketing, Servewell, one M/s Sunware's
trays, and photographs from other traders and retailers have been produced.
14\. It is submitted that Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957, provides
that where a design, capable of being registered under the Designs Act, is not
so registered, copyright (in such design) shall cease as soon as any article,
to which the design has been applied is reproduced more than 50 times by an
industrial process by the owner of the copyright or with his licence, by any
other person. Relying on the Division Bench ruling in Microfibres Inc. v.
Girdhar & Co. & Anr., 2009 (40) PTC 519 (Del), Dolphin submits that in this
case, the Court ruled that there is lesser copyright protection, in the case
of industrial designs. The relevant portion of the said Division Bench
judgment reads as follows:
> "32. A perusal of the Copyright Act and the Designs Act and indeed the
> Preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Designs Act makes
> it clear that the legislative intent was to grant a higher protection to
> pure original artistic works such as paintings, sculptures etc and lesser
> period of protection to design activity commercial in nature. The period of
> copyright would be the author's life span plus 60 years. However, the
> legislature has allocated a lesser time span for the protection available to
> a registered design as only being 15 years. Thus, commerce and art have been
> treated differently by the Legislature and any activity which is commercial
> in nature has been granted lesser period of protection. On the other hand,
> pure artistic works per se have been granted a longer protection.
> A perusal of the above Section 6 clearly indicates that once the design has
> been registered for a particular article comprised in a class of articles,
> the subsequent registration of other articles comprised in that class of
> articles shall not be refused but the subsequent registration shall not
> extend the period of copyright in the design beyond that arising from the
> previous registration. It is significant that the subsequent registration
> has statutorily been mandated not to extend the period of copyright
> registration beyond the period beginning from the original registration.
> This clearly shows the legislative intent of limiting the copyright
> protection in the design to the initial period of 10 years, extendable by
> further period of 5 years.

> 35\. However, there can be no quarrel with the plea of Shri Ramachandran
> that the operation of Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act does not exclude
> from the ambit of Copyright protection either the original "artistic work"
> upon which the design is based or the design which by itself is an artistic

> 1957 and would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection. This
> is also evident from the definition of the design under Section 2(d) of the
> Designs Act. This, in our view, in fact is a factor which would go against

> original artistic work such as a painting, as contrasted with the applied
> artistic work that is the design, which in the present case does not mean
> the intermediary medium such as a mould, engraving devised/produced only to
> enable industrial application of the painting to produce the furnishing

> furnishings would only be covered by the limitations placed in Section 15 of
> the Copyright Act and would get protection if registered as a design under
> the Designs Act but would enjoy lesser period of protection in case of a
> registered design.
> 36\. This clearly shows that the legislature intended that even if the
> artistic work such as a painting has been used as the basis for designing an
> industrially produced object for commerce, such as the furnishing in the
> present case, nevertheless the original painting would indeed enjoy full
> copyright protection, while the result of the industrial application of such
> painting, namely, the design used in the industrial production of the
> ultimate product shall enjoy lesser period of protection as stipulated under
> the Designs Act provided it is registered as a design under the Designs Act.
> Thus, we are of the view that an original artistic work initially acquires
> protection under the Copyright Act as an 'artistic work' or else the
> protection under the Designs Act qua the product created from the artistic

15\. From the above discussion, it is apparent that what is in issue is the
alleged copyright infringement, by Dolphin, in respect of the artistic works
which are depicted in the trays offered for sale, by it. Copyright is claimed,
in respect of these works, by Servewell, as assignee/owner. The original owner
it is claimed, created them, for the purpose of publication of calendar and
other similar matter, sometime in 2005-2006; Servewell submits that copyright
assignment took place, by such author, on 27th May, 2006; a copy of the deed
has been produced, (in a list filed after the suit was filed, and Dolphin's
written statement was filed) on 11th March, 2010. Servewell urges that even
though the depiction of flowers can be reproduced, Dolphin, in copying all
other features, such as the exact colour combinations, even the position of
the unique colour bars and designs, has indulged in copyright violation.
Dolphin's answer is that the floral depiction is itself copied from previously
published photographs and works and that the other elements (such as colour
combinations) do not constitute any creative element.
IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 9
16\. It is now well known that copyright law does not grant the author of a
literary work protection on ideas and facts. (Baker v. Seldon, 101 US 99
[1879], Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d (2d Cir. 1930), RG Anand
v. M/s Delux Films, (1978) 4 SCC 118) It is only the creative expression of
ideas which is conferred exclusive privilege (to exploit, the various rights
emanating from it) for a limited time. Copyright does not extend to every
expression, but those which are fixed in a medium and are "original". Section
13 of the Copyright Act provides that only "original, literary, artistic,
dramatic and musical works" are entitled to copyright protection. Any literary
work, in order to qualify as work in which copyright can subsist, must
therefore be original. Originally, in University London Press v. University
Tutorial Press, [1916] 2 Ch. 601 the Court formulated the "sweat of the brow"
doctrine, to scrutinize whether a work was original or not. The Court
emphasized that the aesthetic content of the work, or its artistic appeal was
irrelevant, so long as the author or creator was able to show that some effort
had been put in to create it. This test was discarded and a more exacting
creativity standard ("the modicum of creativity") was insisted upon by the US
Supreme Court, in Fiest Publication Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service, 199 US
340 (1991). The Supreme Court recognized this shift and in Eastern Book
Company v. DB Modak (supra), following the approach laid down by the Canadian
Supreme Court in CCH Canadian Ltd., v. Law Society of Upper Canada, (2004) SCC
13, rejected the "sweat of the brow doctrine", (which conferred copyright on
works merely because time, energy, skill and labour was expended), and held
that the work must be original "in the sense that by virtue of selection, co-
ordination or arrangement of pre-existing data contained in the work, a work
somewhat different in character is produced by the author". Thus, in India,
the test for creativity establishes a higher threshold than the "sweat of the
brow" doctrine, but not as high as "modicum of creativity". It acknowledges
that that not every effort or industry, or expending of skill, results in
copyrightable work, but only those, which create works that are somewhat
different in character, involve some intellectual effort, and involve a
certain degree of creativity.
17\. If this Court were to test the plaintiff's contentions from this
standpoint, it would be apparent that each artistic work has to be seen, to
determine, on a visual comparison with the infringing work, whether indeed it
is "copyrightable" and whether Dolphin has copied them. Out of the allegations
of copyright infringement, three artistic works relate to flowers. The designs
in the trays are dominated by these flowers, and floral designs. A comparison
of each of the flowers IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 10
with the extracts from the two books/ publications relied on immediately
reveals that Servewell's flower/ flower designs replicate the flowers and
floral designs found in the two published books "The Planimetric Design
Cyclopedia 2004" and "Japanese & Korean Graphic Materials Design Dictionary".
Indeed, Servewell, during the hearings, conceded that Dolphin could reproduce
the flowers, but underlined that yet, the copyright in the overall artistic
works relied on by it, had been infringed. The emphasis here was to the manner
in which colours were portrayed, inlaying the floral designs or flowers.
18\. There are two aspects which require consideration, even at the prima
facie stage. One, whether there is the minimum creativity element, in the
depiction of colours and their positioning, and if so, whether their
combination with elements, for which no copyright protection can be claimed,
(i.e. the flowers) would render them original artistic works. The kind of
colours depicted, and the shapes in which they are shown horizontal yellow
bars or strokes, (in A-84938/09); blue stripe/ strokes forming the background
for a pale yellow and white flower, (in A-84944/09) Golden flora set in yellow
(A-84940/09); violet flower petals set against horizontal violet and white
stripes (A-84942/09) and tulips in vase, set in yellow (A-84943/09) are
commonplace. The colour depictions are in the form of broad lines or stripes,
and appear to have been created by using some computer software, or else are
plain brush strokes, matching the colours of the flowers and floral designs
they underlay. They do not fulfil the new originality or creativity standard
spelt out in Eastern Book Co. Such being the case, the mere combination of two
non-copyrightable elements by itself - at least in this case, does not result
in a new copyrightable artistic work. So far as A-84919 is concerned, no claim
to any colour combination is made; in fact the copyright registration
certificate attaches only a pink flower depiction. This Court is also mindful
of the circumstance that copyright, based on originality or uniqueness is
inadmissible to mere colours or colour combinations. For these reasons, the
Court does not prima facie discern any copyright infringement.
19\. So far as the depiction of various spices (such as cinnamon sticks, red
and yellow peppers, turmeric, red chilli, chilli powder, cardamom, olive oil,
etc. in different sized bowls or containers/jugs) are concerned, there may be
no originality or creativity in each element. The positioning of these
elements, and the depiction of containers, appears to have been reproduced by
the artist, who perhaps kept them on the table, and depicted them on canvas,
or some other IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 11 medium.
That these are commonplace objects cannot be denied. There can also be no
denial that depiction of such condiments and spices for cooking or culinary
efforts, is limited, if the effort is only to show them. Here, the idea of
showing the spices in containers is necessarily limited, and conferment of
monopoly to the artist would prevent the reproduction of such objects. In a
somewhat similar context, where the creator of a jewel pin design inspired by
a bee complained of copyright infringement. The US Federal Court of Ninth
Circuit in Herbert Rosenthal Jewelery Corporation Vs. Kalpakian 446 F.2d 738
(1971) rejected the claim for protection, starting as follows :
> "The critical distinction between "idea" and "expression" is difficult to
> draw. As Judge Hand candidly wrote, "Obviously, no principle can be stated
> as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed
> its 'expression.'" Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d
> 487, 489 (2d Cir.1960). At least in close cases, one may suspect, the
> classification the court [**11] selects may simply state the result reached
> rather than the reason for it. In our view, the difference is really one of
> degree as Judge Hand suggested in his striking "abstraction" formulation in
> Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930). The
> guiding consideration in drawing the line is the preservation of the balance
> between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright
> laws.
> What is basically at stake is the extent of the copyright owner's monopoly
> -- from how large an area of activity did Congress intend to allow the
> copyright owner to exclude others? We think the production of jeweled bee
> pins is a larger private preserve than Congress intended to be set aside in
> the public market without a patent. A jeweled bee pin is therefore an "idea"
> that defendants were free to copy. Plaintiff seems to agree, for it disavows
> any claim that defendants cannot manufacture and sell jeweled bee pins and
> concedes that only plaintiff's particular design or "expression" of the
> jeweled bee pin "idea" is protected under its copyright. The difficulty, as
> we have noted, is that on this record the "idea" and its "expression" appear
> to be [**12] indistinguishable. There is no greater similarity between the
> pins of plaintiff and defendants than is inevitable from the use of jewel-
> encrusted bee forms in both.
> When the "idea" and its "expression" are thus inseparable, copying the
> "expression" will not be barred, since protecting the "expression" in such
> circumstances would confer a monopoly of the "idea" upon the copyright owner
> free of the conditions and limitations imposed by the patent law. Baker v.
> Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 103, 25 L. Ed. 841 (1879); Morrissey v. Procter &
> Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678-679 (1st Cir. 1967); Crume v. Pacific Mut.
> Life Ins. Co., 140 F.2d 182, 184 (7th Cir. 1944). See also Continental Cas.
> Co. v. Beardsley, 253 F.2d 702, 705-706 (2d Cir. 1958)."
For the above reasons, the claim for copyright protection in respect of the
work embodied in A-84941/09 also cannot stand.

20\. The next question is the allegation of infringement of design, by
Dolphin. The relevant provisions of the Designs Act are reproduced below, for
the sake of convenience. Section 2 (d) defines "design" as follows:
> "(d) "design" means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern,
> ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether
> in two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms, by any industrial
> process or means, whether manual mechanical or chemical, separate or
> combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by

> anything which is in substance a mere mechanical device, and does not
> include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of
> section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) or
> property mark as defined in section 479 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of

    Registration is provided in Section 11:
           "11. Copyright on registration.-

A person claiming that some design does not reveal any novelty can apply for
its cancellation, under Section 19:

being Servewell's distributor. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the
photographs forming part of Annexure E to the said application, with the
photographs relied on by Servewell, in support of its claim for infringement
of design, prima facie, reveal that the designs are the same. In these
circumstances, the Court is of opinion that Dolphin has a reasonably arguable
case in support of its contention that the design registration is liable to be
challenged. Of course, these observations are tentative, and based on the
existing materials; the parties are yet to test their respective strengths in
the trial, in this case. Consequently, the Court is of the view that the
injunction vis-Ã - vis the registered design cannot be granted.
22\. As a result of the above discussion, it is held that the subsisting
interim order has to be vacated. The injunction in respect of the artistic
works, which have been registered by the first plaintiff, is hereby vacated.
Likewise, the injunction in respect of Design No. 217625 is hereby vacated.
Resultantly, the defendant is permitted to open the seals in respect of all

1\. This is an order deciding two applications, i.e. I.A. No. 383/2010 (of

under section 51 and 55 of the Copyright Act, 1957 read with section 22 of the
Designs Act, 2000 restraining infringement of registered design, copyright and
passing off by the defendant.
2\. The suit states that the first and the second plaintiffs (hereafter
jointly, "Servewell") are sister concerns, as they are controlled by members
of the same family. It is further stated that the first plaintiff came into
existence more than a decade ago, whereas the second plaintiff was established
on 01.04.2005. Servewell are engaged in the business of designing, developing,

commissioned the services of one Mr. Bhupendra Chotalia, a commercial artist
to design art works for calendar and greeting cards for the year 2006, to be
distributed among stockists and distributors. The copyright in the said art
works vests in the first plaintiff, by assignment. It is stated that the
second plaintiff, using the said artistic works launched its first line of
products. The suit avers that this product line was a resounding success in

on 01.04.2005. Servewell are engaged in the business of designing, developing,
manufacturing marketing and exporting domestic kitchen appliances, melamine
decorative IA Nos. 383/2010 & 1119/2010 in CS(OS) 49/2010 Page 1 serving trays
and tableware. It is claimed that they have manufactured and marketed the
above said goods in scores of different shapes, sizes, designs and artistic
works, which, according to them, have been well received by the consumers. The
first plaintiff claims to be the owner of almost all intellectual property
rights of the group and the second plaintiff is aggressively manufacturing and
marketing the aforementioned goods in domestic, as well as international
market. Servewell claims that their business is well-known for superior
quality, durability and unique attractive artwork depicted on their products
sold under their distinctive trademark "SERVEWELL".
3\. It is stated that, as a part of promotional activities, in 2005 Servewell
commissioned the services of one Mr. Bhupendra Chotalia, a commercial artist
to design art works for calendar and greeting cards for the year 2006, to be
distributed among stockists and distributors. The copyright in the said art
works vests in the first plaintiff, by assignment. It is stated that the
second plaintiff, using the said artistic works launched its first line of
products. The suit avers that this product line was a resounding success in
photographs relied on by Servewell, in support of its claim for infringement
of design, prima facie, reveal that the designs are the same. In these
circumstances, the Court is of opinion that Dolphin has a reasonably arguable
case in support of its contention that the design registration is liable to be
challenged. Of course, these observations are tentative, and based on the
existing materials; the parties are yet to test their respective strengths in
the trial, in this case. Consequently, the Court is of the view that the
injunction vis-Ã - vis the registered design cannot be granted.
22\. As a result of the above discussion, it is held that the subsisting
interim order has to be vacated. The injunction in respect of the artistic
works, which have been registered by the first plaintiff, is hereby vacated.
Likewise, the injunction in respect of Design No. 217625 is hereby vacated.
Resultantly, the defendant is permitted to open the seals in respect of all
the products I.A. No. 383/2010 (the plaintiffs' application under Order XXXIX
Rules 1 & 2) is dismissed and I.A. No. 1119/2010 (Dolphin's application for
vacation for stay) is therefore allowed. No costs.
