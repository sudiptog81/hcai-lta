1\. Heard. Admit. Taken up for final disposal with the consent of the learned
Counsel for the rival parties.
2\. This appeal was taken up for final disposal with the consent of the
Counsel for the rival parties in view of the fact that application under Order
VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the respondent/defendant
was allowed and consequently, the appellant contended that he stands without
any remedy.
FACTS
3\. The appellant is the original plaintiff, who filed Special Civil Suit
No.3/2010 in the Court of District Judge 5, Nagpur under Section 60 of the
Copyright Act, 1957 for declaration and permanent injunction. He averred that
he developed a software to facilitate the professionals like Income Tax
Advocates, Chartered Accountants, Sales Tax practitioners, Accountants in
their professional work.
The objective is to facilitate automatic preparation of return, namely form
No.231 to 324, to validate 'E-

                                                   3                         fa1076.11.odt
         returns'    with       inbuilt   validation,          utility        and      auto
         calculation       facility       etc.    amongst         so      many       other
         functions        and    programmes       developed          in       the      said
software. It was processed since the year 2005 and finally was launched in the
market in the year 2007.
The software became popular in the market and consequently, the competitors of
the plaintiff including the respondents/defendants started creating obstacles
in the marketing of the said product. As a result of the intention of the
respondents to obstruct the plaintiff from doing his business of marketing the
said product, the respondents filed F.I.R. with Police Station Nasik on
30.1.2010 which registered as Crime No.3007/2010 under Sections 63 and 65 of
the Copyright Act. Acting on the said F.I.R., Nasik police suddenly visited
the premises of the plaintiff on 3.2.2010 without any knowledge or intimation
to the plaintiff and seized various materials from his office and went away.
Even before the said action and thereafter the respondents started oral
campaign about the plaintiff's said product falsely propagating that the
product was not of good quality and so on and so forth. The plaintiff having
no alternative filed  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 4
fa1076.11.odt Special Civil Suit No.3/2010 on 3.3.2010.
4\. Thereafter, the respondents/defendants on 29.3.2010 filed a suit under
Section 55 of the Copyright Act in the Court at Nasik vide Civil Suit
No.1/2010 and also obtained ex parte injunction on 15.4.2010 and upon
appearance of the present plaintiff before the Nasik Court and after hearing
the parties, the said Court on 14.10.2010 suspended the said order of ex parte
ig injunction till the decision on the application under Order VII Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the respondents in the civil suit at
Nagpur. In the civil suit at Nagpur the respondents/defendants filed an
application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for
rejection of plaint on the ground that Section 60 suit filed by the plaintiff
was hit by its proviso since the defendants had already filed a suit in the
Nasik Court with due diligence and in the police action F.I.R. was filed and
now chargesheet has been filed against the appellant/plaintiff. Another reason
to claim rejection of the plaint was non-disclosure of true cause of action.
The said application was decided by the District Judge by his order dated
22.6.2011 and  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 5 fa1076.11.odt was
allowed. The said order of rejection of plaint dated 22.6.2011 was challenged
before this Court in First Appeal No.667/2011. This Court disposed of the said
appeal on 17.9.2011 and set aside the order of rejection of plaint dated
22.6.2011 with the consent of the parties and after framing two questions
asked the trial Court to decide them in accordance with law.
The trial Court heard the parties on the said two questions framed and decided
the application and again rejected the plaint by allowing the said application
by the impugned order dated 10.10.2011. Hence, this appeal against the said
order dated 11.10.2011.
SUBMISSIONS :
5\. In support of the appeal, learned Counsel for the appellant made the
following submissions.
(i) The learned District Judge committed an error in holding that lodgment of
FIR with Police Station, seizure of the articles from the office of plaintiff
after conducting raid do not amount to threat or threat to initiate legal
proceeding.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:57 :::
                                                     6                          fa1076.11.odt
                      (ii)           FIR,        seizure       of      articles           upon
         conduct     of     raid    by     the     police         would        amount        to
         commencement        of    legal    proceeding           on     criminal          side
         against the appellant.
                      (iii)          There are clear averments in the
         plaint      about       threat     by     the      respondents             to     the
plaintiff including that of lodgment of FIR and that the plaintiff had not
committed any infringement of any of the legal rights of the respondents and
that is why the suit filed under Section 60 was perfectly maintainable.
(iv) Section 55 does bar the suit under Section 60 because Section 60 suit was
filed first in point of time by the present appellant on 3.3.2010 while
Section 55 suit was filed by the respondents on 29.3.2010.
(v) As a matter of fact even according to the respondents on 17.12.2009
complaint was filed by the respondents with Cyber Crime Department of Police
at Nasik. Long thereafter i.e. on 29.3.2010 the suit under Section 55 came to
be filed, which cannot be said to be with due diligence. The suit under
Section 60 was filed earlier and therefore, the  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 7 fa1076.11.odt subsequent suit filed under Section 55
cannot render the appellant's suit under Section 60 infructuous as contended.
(vi) The decisions relied upon by the trial Court have no application at all
in the instant case because they did not directly relate to the issue of suit
under Section 60 filed earlier than the suit under Section 55 of the Act.
(vii) The District Judge trying the suit under Section 60 is definitely having
the jurisdiction to entertain the suit and the suit was not barred as
contemplated by Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(viii) The plaintiff/appellant had an ex parte order of injunction in his
favour but because of the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of
Civil Procedure filed by the respondents/defendants and rejection of the
plaint by the trial Court on both occasions, the relief of injunction has been
taken away at the behest of respondents/defendants, resulting into severe
financial loss to the appellant/plaintiff. The trial Court did not at all
undertake the exercise of trying application Exh.5 and  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 8 fa1076.11.odt looking to the fact that prima facie
strong case has been made out by the appellant/plaintiff, temporary injunction
is required to be granted in favour of the plaintiff to save any further loss
as it is the respondents/defendants who are responsible for prolonging the
matter by insertion of frivolous application under Order VII Rule 11 of the
Code of Civil Procedure and compelling the plaintiff to make rounds of
litigation.
(ix) This Court, therefore, should issue injunction in favour of the
plaintiff, looking to the vicious conduct of the respondents with exemplary
costs.
He relied the following decision.
(a) Delhi High Court (Super Cassette Industries Ltd...Versus...Bathla
Cassettes India (P) Ltd. on 4 February, 1993 = 50 (1993) DLT 7).
6\. Per contra, learned Counsel for the respondents vehemently opposed the
appeal and made the following submissions.
(a) The impugned order passed by the trial Court is perfectly justified and no
interference is required to be made.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:57 :::
                                             9                          fa1076.11.odt
                     (b)         The suit filed under Section 60 by
the plaintiff has automatically become infructuous no sooner the suit under
Section 55 was filed by the respondents/defendants before the District Judge
at Nasik.
(c) Merely because the suit at Nasik Court was filed after about 26 days after
filing of the suit by the plaintiff, it cannot be said that it was not filed
with due diligence.
(d) The defendants took the remedy of lodgment of FIR with police station
which itself shows that it was an act of due diligence on the part of the
defendants. The fact that the police have conducted raid on 2.3.2010 and
thereafter filed chargesheet on 23.7.2010 against the plaintiff clearly
indicates prima facie evidence against the plaintiff about piracy.
(e) FIR lodged by the defendants cannot be called as 'threat' of any legal
proceedings because the complaint was about infringement of rights of the
defendants in respect of copyright and the cognizable offence under the
Copyright Act.

                     (f)        The observations made by the trial
Court in that behalf are legal, correct and proper.
(g) The plaint allegations nowhere show any cause of action for filing the
suit under Section 60.
(h) The very requirement of Section 60 for filing a suit is that there should
be threat of legal proceeding or liability and such allegations of
infringement of any legal rights were in fact not true. Proviso to Section 60
is very important inasmuch as it specifically prohibits the suit, if the
ingredients of threat and legal proceeding are absent and those are absent in
the instant case.
(i) Nothing has been shown by the plaintiff that the plaintiff received any
threat within the meaning of Section 60 and therefore, the suit under Section
60 is not maintainable. At any rate, after filing of the suit by the
respondents in the District Court at Nasik, with due diligence, the present
suit under Section 60 of the Act filed by the appellant in Nagpur District
Court has to be dismissed as per the proviso to Section 60 of the Act.

                       (j)                The   plaintiff        has    not     filed       the
software either in the trial Court or before this Court and in the absence
thereof a prayer for injunction is not at all maintainable.
(k) The demonstration made by the plaintiff as well as defendants before this
Court about software indicated that there were several clearly visible items
showing piracy made by the plaintiff and therefore, there is no prima facie
case in favour of the plaintiff to claim any temporary injunction even for
some period.
(l) Since there has been no injunction in favour of the plaintiff from 2010,
he is not entitled to any injunction as claimed in the instant appeal.

of the appeal.

CONSIDERATION :
7\. I have gone through the entire record so also the impugned order. I have
gone through the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957. I have heard learned
Counsel for the rival parties at length on number of occasions. During the
course of hearing since the learned Counsel for the parties wanted to
demonstrate by exhibition of relevant compact disc that there was infringement
of copyright, they were allowed by this Court. During the demonstration,
Counsel for the respondents with the help of respondents started showing
similarities or the copying made in the compact disc marketed by the
appellant. When the demonstration was going on it was pointed out by the
learned Counsel for the appellant upon instructions from the appellant that
the portions which were being shown from the disc of the respondents as
similar or pirated in the compact disc of the appellant was not the copyright
registered under the Copyright Act. Learned Counsel for the  ::: Downloaded on
- 09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 14 fa1076.11.odt respondent was therefore asked to
show the registration thereof but then even after taking few adjournments
learned Counsel for the respondent did not produce any registration of that
disc/copyright which was being objected to at the time of demonstration and
that is why the learned Counsel for the respondent then took a stand that it
was not necessary to have copyright registered under the Copyright Act and in
support of the said proposition, learned Counsel for the respondent showed
certain decisions including the one rendered by the Delhi High Court. Counsel
for the appellant argued that registration was compulsory or mandatory. Fact,
however, remains that respondents could not produce the evidence of
registration in order to show that their copyright was registered much less
earlier to than that of the appellant or that their product was brought into
existence before the product of the appellant was brought into existence.
Learned Counsel for the respondents even filed written note of argument and
referred to the expression of opinion made by this Court vide paragraph no.5
of the note and as answer to the said expression, in paragraph no.16  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:57 ::: 15 fa1076.11.odt of the written note,
took a clearcut stand with support of the decisions referred in that paragraph
saying that registration is not necessary. In the entire written note of
argument nowhere has been mentioned that the copyright in question was
registered by the respondents anywhere in the country with the Registrar.
Since the question about registration has been vehemently raised by both
parties, I am required to decide it. In view of the above discussion,
following points arise for my determination in this appeal.
                              (1)       Whether              registration                   of

                 taking     recourse             to        the       provisions            of
                 Copyright Act, 1957 ?

                              (2)       (a) Whether lodgment of FIR,
                 registration          of    offence,                seizure           under
                 Section     64       against         the         appellant            would
constitute 'threat' of legal proceedings or liability against the appellant ?

Copyright Act, 1914 was in force before the Copyright Act, 1957 was brought
into force after independence. It is true that Statements of Objects and
Reasons accompanying a Bill cannot be used to interpret and determine the true
meaning and effect of the substantive provisions of the Statute.
They can not be used except for the limited purpose of  ::: Downloaded on -

antecedent state of affairs leading up to the legislation. I, therefore,
undertake the limited exercise to find out the several new features when the
Copyright Act, 1957 was brought into existence from the Statement of objects
and Reasons, which I quote hereunder :
                         (1)         A         Copyright         Office          is
                 sought     to     be      established            under         the
                 immediate

                                   who     shall
                                                 of     a
                                                        act

                                                                  under
                                                                                 of
                                                                                the
                 superintendence           and        direction         of      the
                 Central         Government.             The         principal
function of the Copyright Office will be to maintain Register of Copyrights in
which may be entered, at the option of the authors, the names and addresses of
authors and owners of copyright for the time being, and other relevant
particulars. Such Register will easily make available useful information to
interested members of public in regard to copyrighted works. In order to
encourage registration of copyrights, provision is made that no proceeding
regarding infringement of copyright shall be instituted unless copyright is
registered in the Copyright Office. In addition to being in charge of the
Copyright Office,  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 18
fa1076.11.odt the duties of the Registrar of Copyrights will be to entertain
and dispose of applications for compulsory licences and to inquire into
complaints of importation of infringing copies. An appeal to the Copyright
Board is provided for against the orders of the Registrar of Copyrights.
(2) Provision is made for setting up a Copyright Board which will determine
the reasonableness of the rates of fees, charges or royalties claimed by
performing rights societies, consider applications for general licences for
public performances of works and will assess compensation payable under the
Bill in certain circumstances. An appeal will lie to the High Court against
the decisions of the Copyright Board.
          (3)            The     definition       of       copyright
          is     enlarged       to     include      the      exclusive
          right          to      communicate             works           by
          radio-diffusion.
          (4)            A cinematography film will have
          a     separate        copyright      apart        from        its
various components, namely, story, music etc.

returns the amount received by him at the time of the assignment with interest
thereon.
(6) The normal term of the copyright is fixed to be the life of the author and
a period of 25 years after his death as against the existing term of the life
of the author, and a period of 50 years after his death. Shorter terms are
fixed for anonymous or pseudonymous works, cinematograph films, mechanical
contrivances, photograph, etc. (7) Under the existing law, the sole right to
produce a translation of a work first published in India is extinguished after
ten years, unless a translation thereof is produced within that period. The
Draft Bill makes the right co-extensive with other rights arising out of
copyright.
          (8)              Provision is made for the issue
          of     a    general         or        special       licence          for

9\. In the year 1983, Amendment Act 23 of 1983 was brought to amend the said
Act of 1957. Thereafter, the Amendment Act 65 of 1984 was brought but the
provision as to the computer programmes and films was actually not inserted by
the said amendment.
10\. w.e.f.
It appears that thereafter by Act 38 of 1994 10.5.1995 clause (ff) of Section
2 was substituted to include (ffb) and (ffc) for inserting entries of computer
and computer programme. It, therefore, appears that the terms computer and
computer programme entered the Copyright Act for the first time by virtue of
the said Amendment Act No.38 of 1994.

particular the aspect whether the registration is mandatory or not was

Section 17 and the scheme of the said Act does not  ::: Downloaded on -

Sarma and another, reported in AIR 1960 Andhra Pradesh 415, the Division Bench
with reference to provisions of Copyright Act II of 1334F applicable to former
State of Hyderabad held registration as condition precedent. Justice
Jaganmohan Reddy speaking for the Bench in paragraph 11 held thus :
                                 11.         Though      the      work      is      an
              original         one,    the       question        of    copyright
              therein      would depend upon the protection
              given by the statute.                      Copyright is the
              exclusive          right      of    multiplying           for      sale
              copies       of       works     of     literature            or     art
              allowed          to    the     author       thereof          or     his
assignees and in so far as British India was concerned, the statute governing
these matters was by virtue of S. 3 of the Indian Copyright Act III of 1914,
the Copyright Act of 1911 enacted by the British Parliament, subject to such
modifications  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 24 fa1076.11.odt as
stated in the Indian Act. Under the English enactment, (Ss. 1 and 2) copyright
may subsist subject to the provisions of that Act in every original literary,
dramatic, musical artistic work.
The book Hyderabad Pai Police Charya will certainly be, as we have already
held, an original work within the meaning of the English Copyright Act as
applied to British India. We may, however, observe that under soon the English
Act as applied to India, as as the contribution of an author satisfies the
requirements of S.2, his copyright therein is protected without any
registration. While this is so that Act is not applicable to this case as the
former State of Hyderabad had its own Copyright Act II of 1334F which would
govern this case. In the circumstances, it will have to be determined whether
under the Hyderabad Act the 1st respondent acquired a copyright in his book at
the time when the appellants are alleged to have infringed it.
Copyright has been defined by cl. (b) of S.2 to mean the special right which
any person is entitled to enjoy, of printing, publishing or otherwise
utilising or turning to account, every original composition, compilation or
drawing.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 :::
25 fa1076.11.odt Section 3 provides that every author shall enjoy the
copyright in regard to every book registered and its subsequent editions,
which no other person shall infringe. The cases in which no infringement is
deemed to take place have also been set out, but these are not pertinent for
our discussion. It is clear from the definition and S.3 that an original
composition or compilation is only protected ig if the book will ensure under
S.5 during the lifetime is registered and of the author and after his death
for a further period of 50 years.
Section 8 prescribes the method of registering and preserving a copyright by
providing that every author residing or carrying on business in His Exalted
Highness's Dominions, may with a view to reserve the copyright of any book,
apply for its registration to the office of the Judicial and General
Secretary, by tendering with the application a copy of the book and a fee of
Rs.2 and stating in the application the name or title of the book, the
author's name, his age, occupation and residence, the date of the first
edition of the book, the name and place of the press where it was printed,
and, if its copyright has been sold or  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013

such person, and on these particulars being furnished the Judicial Secretary
who is required to maintain a register in form No.1 annexed to the Act will
cause the entry of the necessary particulars therein and to inform the author
by a Fahmaishnama (memo of information) that the book has been registered and
cause the publication of the fact of registration in the Jarida is (Gazette).

          registration.             Section      9    relates        to     the
procedure of registering the transfer of a copyright. These registers are open
to public inspection under S.10. Section 11 provides for criminal prosecution
and punishment of any person who by fraud or misrepresentation causes an entry
under  S. 8 or S. 9 to be incorrectly made in the register. Section 12
provides for penalties for infringement of the copyright.
A plain reading of the several provisions of the Act, to which we have already
referred, leaves no doubt in our minds that a copyright in a book or drawing
is only secured if it is an original compilation and has been duly registered
according to the provisions of the Act.

Sri Madhava Reddy, attempted to persuade us that a person has an inherent
copyright in an original composition or compilation without the necessity of
its registration and that registration is only meant as a conclusive proof of
that right. Whatever may be the position in what was British India, this
argument is not warranted by the clear and specific provisions of the
Hyderabad Act which makes registration a work.
condition of acquiring a copyright in any The definition section cannot by
itself give any protection unless that is read with S.3 which gives protection
only to a book which is registered.
Apart from the registration of the book, no right is conferred on an author,
but once it is registered, the author is deemed to acquire property rights in
the book as set out in Section to which we shall presently refer. The right
arising on the registration of the book can be the subject matter of civil or
criminal remedy, so that, without it the author can have no rights, nor
remedies in spite of the fact that his work is an original one. The
infringement of the copyright so registered, which in Urdu is expressed as a
theft, can most appropriately be said to be based on the moral principle, as
observed  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 28 fa1076.11.odt by Lord
Atkinson in Macmillan and Co. v. Cooper, AIR 1924 PC 75 dealing with S.2 of
the Copyright Act of 1911 as resting on the eighth commandment Thou shalt not
steal.
A person whose copyright is protected cannot only have recourse to criminal
Courts but also sue in a civil Court under  S. 20 to obtain possession of such
copies infringing his right which is deemed to be a right of property or cause
them to be destroyed or obtain an injunction or call for an account thereof.
This remedy as is evident from explanation to S.20 is not an alternative
remedy, but is an addition to the remedy which he may have in criminal Courts,
for, the compensation if any awarded to him by any criminal Court is to be
taken into consideration in the civil Court.

Court had occasion to consider this question in Kumari Kanaka v Sundararajan,
1972 Ker LR
536\. In the above decision, this court took the view that registration of the
work under the Act is not compulsory and that registration is not a condition
precedent for maintaining a suit for damages for infringement of copyright.
22\. The English Copyright Act of 1862 expressly provided that no proprietor
of any such copyright shall be entitled to the benefit of that Act until the
same has been registered. This provision was however repealed by the English
Copyright Act 1911 and therefore the registration is not a condition precedent
for action against infringement even in England now.
23\. Sections 44 and 45 of the Act is only an enabling provision and the
provisions contained therein do not affect common law right to sue for
infringement of the copyright. In the circumstances, we are of the view that
AIR 1970 Madh. Pra.261 has been wrongly decided. We therefore agree with the
learned counsel for the appellant that the suit is not bad for non-
registration of the copyright by the plaintiff in the instant case.

decision that issue about registration did not fall for consideration as in
that case trial Court had not said anything about registration. That apart
there appears to be no decision of the Bombay High Court directly on this
point.
12\. In the above background, this Court is required to decide as to whether
registration of copyright is compulsory in order to invoke the provisions of
the Copyright Act or remedies provided there under for a person who alleges
infringement of copyright under the Act.
13\. Keeping in mind the entire scheme of the Act and the provisions of the

14\. Relevant portion of Section 17 and 21 read thus :
Section 17. First owner of copyright.- Subject to the provisions of this Act,
the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein:
> Provided that -
> Section 21. Right of author to relinquish copyright. - (1) The author of a

                         (2)    On     receipt        of     a    notice         under

> Copyrights shall cause it to be published in the Official Gazette and in
> such other manner as he may deem fit.
(3) The relinquishment of all or any of the rights comprised in the copyright
in a work shall not affect any rights subsisting in favour of any person on
the date of the notice referred to in sub-section (1).
15\. Section 17 of the Copyright Act, thus, provides for first owner of the
copyright, while Section 21 of the Copyright Act provides for right of author
to relinquish copyright whereupon the said relinquishment is published in the
official gazette by the Registrar. Chapter-V provides for term of copyright.
Chapter-V provides for licences given by owners of copyright. It enables the
owner of the  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 35 fa1076.11.odt
copyright to grant licences to others so also for termination of licences.
Chapter-X relates to registration of copyright. Section 44 reads thus :
Section 44. Register of Copyrights.- There shall be kept at the Copyright
Office a register in the prescribed form to be called the Register of
Copyrights in which may be entered the names or titles of works and the names
and addresses of authors, publishers and owners of copyright and such other
particulars as may be prescribed.
16\. It provides for keeping a register in the prescribed form to be called as
register of copyrights in which names and titles of owners of copyright and
other particulars would be entered. The word 'may' used in this Section 44
casts a duty on the Registrar to make entries if everything is in order.
17\. Section 45 reads thus :
> Section 45. Entries in Register of Copyrights.- (1) The author or publisher
> of, or the owner of or other person interested in the copyright in, any work
> may make an application in the  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 :::

> (2) On receipt of an application in respect of any work under sub-section
> (1), the Registrar of Copyrights may, after holding such inquiry as he may
> deem fit, enter the particulars of the work in the Register of Copyrights.
18\. Section 45 (2) thus provides for holding of an enquiry, if necessary by
Registrar for making  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 37
fa1076.11.odt entries.
19\. Section 47 reads thus :
> Section 47. Form and inspection of register.- The Register of Copyrights and
> indexes thereof kept under this Act shall at all reasonable times be open to
> inspection, and any person shall be entitled to take copies of, or make
> extracts from, such register or indexes on payment ig of such fee and
> subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.
20\. Section 48 provides that register of copyright shall be a prima facie
evidence of particulars entered therein.
21\. Section 50-A is an important provision. It reads thus :
Section 50-A. Entries in the Register of Copyrights, etc., to be published.-
Every entry made in the Register of Copyrights or the particulars of any work
entered under section 45, the correction of every entry made in such register
under section 49, and every rectification ordered under section 50, shall be
published by the Registrar of Copyrights in the Official Gazette or in  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 38 fa1076.11.odt such other manner as
he may deem fit.
22\. Section 50-A thus shows that public at large would come to know about
every entry made in the register of copyrights or particulars entered in
Section 45 after its publication and it would be deemed that they are known to
the public at large after publication. Chapter 9 thus provides for
infringement of copyright.
23\. Section 51 reads thus :
Section 51. When copyright infringed.- Copyright in a work shall be deemed to
be infringed -
                        (a)       when        any        person,             without       a
                 licence          granted       by       the           owner    of      the
                 copyright         or    the    Registrar               of    Copyrights
under this Act or in contravention of the conditions of a licence so granted
or of any condition imposed by a competent authority under this Act-
(i) does anything, the exclusive right to do which is (by this Act) conferred
upon the owner of the copyright, or  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58
::: 39 fa1076.11.odt
(ii) permits for profit any place to be used for the communication of the work
to the public where such communication constitutes an infringement of the
copyright in the work, unless he was not aware and had no reasonable ground
for believing that such communication to the public would be an infringement
of copyright; or
(b) ig when any person -
(i) makes for sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade
displays or offers for sale or hire, or
(ii) distributes either for the purpose of trade or to such an extent as to
affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, or
(iii) by way of trade exhibits in public, or
(iv) imports (***) into India, any infringing copies of the work:
Provided that nothing in sub-clause (iv) shall apply to the import of one copy
of any work for the private and domestic use of the importer.
                       Explanation. -              For the          purposes
          of   this    section,         the     reproduction              of    a
          literary,       dramatic,        musical          or      artistic
                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 :::
                                                       40                         fa1076.11.odt
work in the form of a cinematograph film shall be deemed to be an infringing
copy.
24\. Perusal of Section 51 clearly shows that it shall be deemed that there
shall be infringement of the copyright when any person does anything, the
exclusive right to do is conferred upon the owner of the copyright by the
Copyright Act or any person makes sale of copies of such work by infringement
of the copyright in the said work. It is thus clear from the reading of
Section 51 that infringement shall be deemed when exclusive right to do of the
owner of the copyright is utilized by some other person viz. the infringer.
Now unless such person (the infringer) knows that there is any particular
owner of the copyright in India or that such owner of copyright has registered
his work under Section 44 of the Act before he did, attributing infringement
by him or on his part intentionally or unintentionally, would be an
preposterous. Such a person who is infringing the copyright in a work must be
deemed to have knowledge about the owner of the copyright and such knowledge
cannot be attributed unless the provisions of Chapter  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 41 fa1076.11.odt 10 regarding registration of
copyright, publication thereof etc. are complied with. Otherwise a person who
is innocent can in that event be easily brought in the net of infringement
under civil law or criminally, which can never be the intention of the
legislature.
Thus, reading of Section 51 which defines infringement of right conferred by
this Act, with Section 45 (1) and the word 'may' therein to my mind means; if
a owner of a copyright wants to invoke the provisions of this Act for
enforcing civil and criminal nature of remedies before the special forum,
namely the District Judge rather than a normal civil Court, he must have the
registration. At this stage, it is necessary to reproduce Section 62 of the
Copyright Act, which reads thus :
Section 62 (1). Every suit or other civil proceeding arising under this
Chapter in respect of the infringement of copyright in any work or the
infringement of any other right conferred by this Act shall be instituted in
the district Court having jurisdiction.
                        (2)   For         the          purpose              of
              sub-section (1), a          district Court having
              jurisdiction          shall,           notwithstanding
                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 :::
                                                       42                            fa1076.11.odt
                 anything         contained      in     the       Code     of       Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), or any other law for the time being in force,
include a district Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the
time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person
instituting the suit or other proceeding or, where there are more than one
such persons, any of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on
business or personally works for gain.
It is clear that a Special Forum at the level of the district Court to try a
suit which otherwise would have been triable by ordinary Civil Court has been
provided, if a suit is brought under the provisions of this Act. Further an
additional ground over and above Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure has
been provided. Provision for registration is to regulate the business and for
the benefit of registered owner as well as public at large lest there should
be any infringement attracting Criminal and Civil liability. As to the scope
of Section 62, in the case of Exphar Sa and another...Versus...Eupharma
Laboratories Ltd. and  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 43
fa1076.11.odt another, reported in 2004 (3) Supreme Court Cases 688, the Apex
Court in paragraph nos.12 and 13 stated thus :
                             12. We      would        like       to    emphasise
              the   work     include .          This       shows       that       the
jurisdiction for the purposes of Section 62 is wider than that of the court as
prescribed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The relevant extract of
the report of the Joint Committee published in the Gazette of India dated
23-11-1956 which preceded and laid the foundation for Section 62 (2) said :
In the opinion of the Committee many authors are deterred from instituting
infringement proceedings because the court in which such proceedings are to be
instituted is situated at a considerable distance from the place of their
ordinary residence.
                    The     Committee          feels         that          this
                    impediment      should        be       removed          and
the new sub-clause (2) accordingly provides that infringement proceedings may
be instituted in the District Court within the local limits of whose
jurisdiction the person instituting the proceedings  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 18:15:58 ::: 44 fa1076.11.odt ordinarily resides, carries on
business etc.
13\. It is, therefore, clear that the object and reason for the introduction
of sub-section (2) of Section 62 was not to restrict the owners of the
copyright to exercise their rights but to remove any impediment from their
doing so. Section 62 (2) cannot be read as limiting the jurisdiction of the
District Court only to cases where the person instituting the suit or other
proceeding, or where there are more than one such persons, any of them
actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or presently works for
gain. It prescribes an additional ground for attracting the jurisdiction of a
court over and above the normal grounds as laid down in Section 20 of the
Code.
If he does not want to register the copyright, he may omit to do so; but he
will not be entitled to seek remedy under this Act for want of registration of
his copyright. He may have the remedy elsewhere. At this stage, it is
necessary to notice the provisions of Chapter 13, which deals with offences.
Section 63 reads thus :
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:15:59 :::
45 fa1076.11.odt Section 63. Offence of infringement of copyright or other
rights conferred by this Act.- Any person who knowingly infringes or abets the
infringement of-
(a) the copyright in a work, or
(b) any other right conferred by this Act (except the right conferred by
section 53-A)shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not
be less than six months but which may extend to three years and with fine
which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to two
lakh rupees:
Provided that where the infringement has not been made for gain in the course
of trade or business the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be
mentioned in the Judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of
less than six months or a fine of less than fifty thousand rupees.
Explanation. - Construction of a building or other structure which, infringes
or which, if completed, would infringe the copyright in some other work shall
not be an offence under this section.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 :::
46 fa1076.11.odt
25\. Sections 63-B and 64 are relevant for our purpose, which read thus :
Section 63-B. Knowing use of infringing copy of computer programme to be an
offence.- Any person who knowingly makes use on a computer of an infringing
copy of a computer programme shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term
which shall not be less than seven days but which may extend to three years
and with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may
extend to two lakh rupees :
Provided that where the computer programme has not been used for gain or in
the course of trade or business, the Court may, for adequate and special
reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, not impose any sentence of
imprisonment and may impose a fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees.
Section 64. Power of police to seize infringing copies.- (1) Any police
officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector, may, if he is satisfied that
an offence under section 63 in respect of the infringement of copyright in any
work has been, is being or is likely to be, committed, seize without warrant,
all copies of the work, and all plates used for the purpose of  ::: Downloaded
on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 47 fa1076.11.odt making infringing copies of the
work, wherever found, and all copies and plates so seized shall, as soon as
practicable, be produced before a Magistrate.
(2) Any person having an interest in any copies of a work (or plates) seized
under sub-section (1) may, within fifteen days of such seizure, make an
application to the Magistrate for such copies or plates being restored to him
and the Magistrate, after ighearing the applicant complainant and making such
further inquiry and the as may be necessary, shall make such order on the
application as he may deem fit.
26\. Reading of the above penal provisions of Sections 63, 63-B and 64 of the
Copyright Act clearly show that a person knowingly making use of a computer by
infringing copy of a computer programme shall be criminally liable. It is well
settled that provisions relating to penal provisions are required to be
interpreted strictly. Now if there is no registration of copyright by its
owner and such owner of a copyright is not known to the infringer due to non-
registration of the copyright he still would be held criminally liable under
these provisions. To make a  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 48
fa1076.11.odt person liable criminally, it will have to be shown that such a
person was fully knowing about the owner of the copyright and that he indulged
in infringing the said copyright despite knowing the ownership thereof. If
registration is not made and published in the official gazette such infringer
cannot be expected to be aware nor can he be attributed knowledge about the
ownership of the copyright of a particular copyright owner and in that event
the criminal Court would not be able to convict such a person. That may lead
to chaotic situations. Similarly, reading of Section 64 regarding power of
police to seize shows that police officer will have to get himself satisfied
that a particular person (complainant) is the owner of copyright and he will
be so satisfied if such a copyright is registered. When both the complainant
and the alleged infringer claim that their product was launched first and that
their copyright work was made first, in the absence of registration under
Section 44 of the Act, how the police officer will be satisfied to proceed to
take cognizance. The police officer in that case would not be able to move an
inch to effect seizure of the alleged infringing copies. After all  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 49 fa1076.11.odt the provision
regarding seizure is another serious act, which infringes upon the privacy of
a person.
Hence, the word 'may' used in Section 45 of the Act will have to be read as
'shall' having regard to the scheme of the Act of which all material
provisions have been quoted and analyzed by me. I am therefore inclined to
agree with and to follow the interpretation made by the Division Bench of
Andhra Pradesh High Court in AIR 1960 A.P. 415 and Orissa High Court in AIR
1986 Orissa 210.
27\. Thus careful survey of the above provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957 to
my mind clearly denotes that in the absence of registration under Section 44
of the Copyright Act by the owner of the copyright it would be impossible to
enforce the remedies under the provisions of the Copyright Act against the
infringer for any infringement under Section 51 of the Copyright Act. Thus, I
answer point no.1 in the affirmative.
28\. As to point no.2 (a) and (b) :- In order to answer this point, it will be
necessary to have a look at the provisions of Chapter XII of the Act. The
heading of this Chapter is Civil Remedies .
         Section      54    of     this     Chapter           defines          owner        of

copyright . Section 55 reads thus :
                        Section     55.        Civil          remedies          for
               infringement        of        copyright.-            (1)     Where
copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright shall,
except as otherwise provided by this Act, be entitled to all such remedies by
way of injunction, damages, accounts and otherwise as are or may be conferred
by law for the infringement of a right:
Provided that if the defendant proves that at the date of the infringement he
was not aware and had no reasonable ground for believing that copyright
subsisted in the work, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to any remedy other
than an injunction in respect of the infringement and a decree for the whole
or part of the profits made by the defendant by the sale of the infringing
copies as the Court may in the circumstances deem reasonable.
                            (2)     Where,         in        the    case       of    a
               literary, dramatic,             musical or              artistic
work, a name purporting to be that of the author or the publisher, as the case
may be, appears on copies of the work as  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
18:16:04 ::: 51 fa1076.11.odt published, or, in the case of an artistic work,
appeared on the work when it was made, the person whose name so appears or
appeared shall, in any proceeding in respect of infringement of copyright in
such work, be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to be the author or the
publisher of the work, as the case may be.
(3) The costs of all parties in any proceedings in respect of the infringement
of copyright shall be in the discretion of the Court.
29\. Perusal of Section 55 of the Act shows that the owner of the copyright is
entitled to claim the remedy of injunction and damages.
30\. Section 60 of the Copyright Act, 1957 reads thus :
> Section 60. Remedy in the case of groundless threat of legal proceedings. -
> Where any person claiming to be the owner of copyright in any work, by
> circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens, any other person with any

31\. Perusal of Section 60 of the Act clearly shows that a person who has been
threatened with any legal proceeding or liability in respect of alleged
infringement of copyright can institute a suit under this provision. In the
instant case, it is seen from  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 53
fa1076.11.odt the body of the plaint that the appellant averred that the
respondents started writing letters to the customers of the appellant that his
product was not user friendly and was pirated one and thus started affecting
the image of the appellant. Learned Counsel for the respondents urged that the
pleadings in the plaint filed by the appellant do not give specific dates or
instances of various aspects. The Court below has also in paragraph 12 of the
judgment impugned made the same criticism. But that is not correct. In fact,
there are pleadings required to constitute cause of action. It may be true
that these pleadings are not verbose, or with exact date and time. But in my
opinion, at the stage of evidence, the appellant is entitled to give details
and it is not necessary to plead the evidence in the suit. In paragraph no.10,
the appellant stated that he introduced the software in question in the year
2007 and the said fact was very well known to the defendants but then
thereafter he started threatening the appellant with criminal action etc.. It
is also a matter of record that the FIR was lodged by the respondents with
Police Station at Nasik on 3.2.2010. FIR was lodged, seizure was made  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 54 fa1076.11.odt by the police and now
even chargesheet has been filed.
Lodgment of FIR, seizure carried out by the police against the appellant and
finally filing of the chargesheet is nothing but the initiation of legal
proceeding and criminal liability against the appellant for the alleged
infringement of the copyright of the respondents. The Court below recorded a
self-contradictory finding in paragraph 11 of its order. It says that without
lodging FIR, no criminal proceeding under the Act could be initiated, but
suddenly with wrong application of rule of ejusdem generis it held that
lodgment of FIR would not constitute 'threat' to initiate legal proceedings or
liability. When FIR is lodged, it is certainly a step to set up or set the
wheels of criminal law in motion.
That is done obviously with a view to initiate criminal proceedings or
criminal liability. The learned District Judge fell in grave error in holding
that lodgment of FIR is not a legal proceeding or a legal liability and that
therefore there was no threat in the eye of law within the meaning of Section
60 of the Act. Here it would be profitable to quote paragraph no.15 from the
Apex Court judgment in the  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 55

Ltd. and another, reported in 2004 (3) Supreme Court Cases 688.
                                15.          Furthermore,                      the
                appellants' plaint said that the                          cease-
and-desist notice was sent to Appellant 2 at its office in New Delhi and in
that notice it was alleged that Appellant 2 had infringed the copyright of
Respondent 2 to the trade mark Maloxine . Now a cease-and-
desist notice means that the recipient is alleged to have infringed the rights
of the sender of the notice to the copyright and as a result of such alleged
infringement, the recipient is liable to institution of civil and/or criminal
proceedings. It is a threat. The plaint says that this threat was received
within the jurisdiction of the High Court, a fact which was sufficient to
invoke the jurisdiction of that Court. The respondents' reliance on the
decision of this Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu
and Union of India v. Adani Exports Ltd. is inapposite. Those decisions held
that the service of a mere notice may not be sufficient to found jurisdiction
unless such notice formed an integral part of the cause of action. But a  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:04 ::: 56 fa1076.11.odt cease-and-desist
notice in a copyright action cannot, particularly in view of Section 60 of the
Act, be termed to be a mere notice. Such a threat may give rise to the right
to institute a suit to counter such threat and to ask for relief on the ground
that the alleged infringement to which the threat related was not in fact an
infringement of any legal right of the person making such threat.
I, thus, answer point no.2 (a) and (b) both in the affirmative.
32\. As to point no.3 : - In the instant case, earlier to 3.2.2010 the
respondent was propagating against the business interest of the appellant in
the market about the product of the appellant and was also threatening the
appellant with legal proceedings as averred in paragraph 10 of the plaint.
Since according to the appellant in fact, he did not infringe any of the legal
rights of the respondents, the alleged owner of the copyright but still he was
being threatened, he filed a suit under Section 60 of the Act. Section 60 of
the Act is the special provision for a person like the appellant who is under
threat of initiation of  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 57
fa1076.11.odt legal proceeding or criminal liability when the alleged
infringer in fact feels that he did not infringe any of the rights of the
alleged owner of the copyright. Section 55 of the Act provides for remedy only
to the owner of the copyright and except Section 60 there is no other
provision for the alleged infringer, who is of the firm opinion that he did
not infringe any copyright. Thus, remedy under Section 60 has been provided by
the Copyright Act so that person like the appellant should not be without any
remedy.
This goes with elementary principle ubi jus ibi remedium. Indeed, it is a vain
thing to imagine a right without a remedy, for want of right and want of
remedy are reciprocal. The appellant has a right to protect his interest by
showing that the threat imparted by the respondents by lodging FIR, by getting
the seizure done through police machinery is groundless since the appellant
did not infringe any of the legal rights of the respondents. The only remedy
for the appellant in that event is under Section 60 of the Act. Now I shall
consider the next question about the effect of filing of suit under Section 55
of the Act by the respondents in Nasik Court on 29.3.2010  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 58 fa1076.11.odt i.e. after Section 60 suit was filed
on 3.3.2010.
Reading of the proviso with main Section 60 of the Act, which is in aid of the
main Section, to my mind shows that Section 60 cannot be taken recourse to if
the alleged owner of the copyright exercises his alleged right first in point
of time under Section 55 of the Copyright Act. If such alleged owner
institutes proceeding under Section 55 of the Act with due diligence i.e.
before the 'infringer' files Section 60 suit, the alleged infringer shall not
be entitled to file a suit under Section 60 of the Act due to prohibition
provided by the said proviso to Section 60. However, if the alleged infringer
exercises his right to show that threat given to him is groundless and
therefore, institutes civil proceeding under Section 60 of the Act before
filing of the suit under Section 55 of the Act by the alleged owner, he can
continue to prosecute suit under Section 60 of the Act since in that case the
suit under Section 55 was not earlier filed with due diligence.
The suit filed by the appellant under Section 60 earlier in point of time than
the suit filed by the respondent under Section 55 would not be therefore hit
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 59 fa1076.11.odt because of filing
of subsequent suit under Section 55 of the Act later by the respondents. Any
interpretation contrary to the above would result into doing harm to the main
Section 60 and even the main provision will become otiose. Where the alleged
'infringer' who believes that groundless threats of legal proceedings are
imparted to him for months together, can he be asked to wait at the mercy of
the alleged owner of the Copyright to file a suit under Section 55 of the Act?
Similarly, if the savvy copyright owner as a counter-blast files a suit under
Section 55 of the Act after filing of the suit under Section 60 of the Act by
the alleged infringer with a view to make earlier suit infructuous, it will in
my opinion, making the remedy provided under main Section 60 nugatory or
meaningless. The only function of the proviso to Section 60 is to prevent
filing of suit by the alleged infringer when owner of the copyright has
already and earlier filed a suit under Section 55 of the Act. In this case,
suit under Section 60 was filed on 3.3.2010 while suit under Section 55 was
filed on 29.3.2010. In that view of the matter, I am inclined to hold that the
suit filed by  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 60 fa1076.11.odt
the plaintiff under Section 60 does not become infructuous. Hence, I answer
point no.3 in the negative.
33\. As to point no.4 : - On the question of grant of injunction by this
Court, learned Counsel for the respondents vehemently opposed issuance of any
order of temporary injunction even for a limited period till the date of
hearing on Exh.5 before the District Judge. Even in the written note of
argument there is opposition to that effect. However, I do not agree with the
learned Counsel for the respondents for the following reasons.
The suit under Section 60 of the Act was filed on 3.3.2010 and even the status
quo order was obtained by the appellant in the District Court in that suit.
The respondents, however, came with an application under Order VII Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint. The plaint was
rejected and the said order was put to challenge in First Appeal No.667/2011
before this Court which was decided on 17.9.2011 and the said order with the
consent of the learned Counsel for the parties was set aside and the District
Judge was again  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 61 fa1076.11.odt
asked to decide the question in a proper manner, which he decided by the
impugned order on 10.10.2011. It may be true that the appellant did not apply
for injunction in the second round when the matter was remanded by this Court
to the trial Court but then this Court had made the matter time bound and
therefore, one can understand that filing of temporary injunction application
would have delayed the main matter. Be ig that as it may, the question of
jurisdiction and rejection of plaint have now been decided under this judgment
in favour of the appellant. That apart, the respondents though were given
enough opportunity to show the factual infringement of copyright but that was
not shown by the respondents and on the contrary, it was found that the
copyright of the respondents itself was not registered. It is clear that the
respondents have been guilty of not allowing detailed hearing on Exh.5
application for temporary injunction but the respondents indulged in taking
objections on the question of jurisdiction and prayed for rejection of plaint
under Order XII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for no justifiable
reasons and on a totally  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 62
fa1076.11.odt ill-founded and unwarranted legal advice. There is no reason why
the appellant should suffer for the frivolous objections about jurisdiction
taken by the respondents. At any rate, following tests by the Apex Court in
the case of R.G. Anand...Versus...M/s. Delux Films and others, reported in AIR
1978 Supreme Court 1613 have also been considered by me and found no material
infringement as claimed from the pleadings and documents and even in the
unregistered disc of the respondent.
1\. There can be no copyright in an idea, subject-matter, themes, plots or
historical or legendry facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is
confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the
author of the copyrighted work.
                         2.    Where         the   same      idea       is     being
                  developed         in   a    different        manner,        it     is
                  manifest      that         the   source       being        common,
similarities are bound to occur. In such a case the courts should determine
whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of
the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the defendant's
work is nothing  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 63 fa1076.11.odt
but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and
there it would amount to violation of the copyright. In other words, in order
to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once
leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.
3\. One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there
has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader, spectator or the
viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and
gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy
of the original.
4\. Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so
that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work, no question of
violation of copyright arises.
                 5.      Where        however       apart        from       the
          similarities          appearing       in      the     two       works
          there       are       also      material             and        broad
          dissimilarities               which           negative            the
          intention       to    copy     the       original          and    the
          coincidences          appearing       in      the     two       works
are clearly incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 :::
                                               64                         fa1076.11.odt
                        6.    As   a     violation       of      copyright
amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence
after applying the various tests laid down by the case law discussed above.
7\. Where, however, the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage
play by a film producer or a Director the task of the plaintiff becomes more
difficult to prove piracy. It is manifest broader that unlike a stage play a
film has a much perspective, wider field and a bigger background where the
defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and
complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has
expressed the idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film gets a
totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the original
play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved.
34\. That apart, even prima facie it has not been shown by the respondents
that their product was registered under Copyright Act. To say that respondents
would show the same later on during the course of trial and hence, no
injunction should be granted, would be doing injustice to the appellant,  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 ::: 65 fa1076.11.odt who has been
marketing his product since the year 2007 and has now been suddenly prevented
from doing so.
Even the offence has been registered against the appellant and his property
has been seized.
35\. In my opinion, application Exh.5 is required to be heard in details by
the District Judge, who never undertook the said exercise but then the
appellant has made out a strong prima facie case in his favour for an order of
injunction till Exh.5 is decided by the District Judge at least now. In that
view of the matter, I had expressed in the open Court and which I do here that
the order of temporary injunction should operate for a period of two months
only and within that period Exh.5 should be decided by the District Judge by
giving full opportunity to both sides. I follow the same course and therefore,
I am inclined to grant temporary injunction against the respondents and in
favour of the appellant only for a period of two months. The balance of
convenience is, obviously in the above background, in favour of the appellant.
Hence, I answer point no.4 in the affirmative.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:16:05 :::
                                                 66                         fa1076.11.odt
         36.          As     discussed       earlier,      respondents            raised
frivolous objection and claimed rejection of plaint and thus resulting into
two rounds of litigation before this Court. Hence, the appellant will have to
be compensated by an order of costs. I direct the respondents to pay costs of
Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) to the appellant within a period of
four weeks.
37\. The upshot of the above discussion is that this appeal will have to be
partly allowed. Hence, I make the following order.
O R D E R
(i) First Appeal No.1076/2011 is partly allowed with costs quantified at
Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) payable by the respondents to the
