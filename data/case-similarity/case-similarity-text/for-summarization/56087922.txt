87\. Therefore, with reference to the issue of the refund of the Deemed
Generation incentive we confirm the order of the State Commission. As such the
contention of the Appellant in regard to this issue would fail. However, as
indicated in earlier paragraphs, we accept the contention of the Appellant
with regard to the first issue and as such the finding given by the State
Commission in regard to the liability to pay the compensation is liable to be
set aside. Accordingly, the same is set aside.
88\. in the result, the Appeal No. 77 of 2009 filed by Gujarat Urgja Vikast
Nigam Ltd. is dismissed and the Appeal No. 86 of 2009 filed by Essar Power
Ltd. is partly allowed. No costs.

    AS PER HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M. KARPAGA VINAYAGAM,
    CHAIRPERSON
                                JUDGMENT
1\. Both these Appeals No. 77 of 2009 and 86 of 2009 have been heard together
and Common Judgment is being rendered as both the Appeals would arise out of
the Common Order passed by the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission
(State Commission) on 18.02.2009.
2\. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd, the erstwhile Electricity Board, is the
Appellant in Appeal No. 77 of 2009 and Essar Power Ltd. is the Appellant in
Appeal No. 86 of 2009. The short facts are as under:
ZA Page 2 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
3\. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited is the successor of the Electricity Board
of Gujarat (Electricity Board). The erstwhile Electricity Board had entered
into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) dated 30.05.1996 with the Essar Power
Limited (EPL) for the purchase of power for a period of 20 years. In the same
year, on 29.06.1996, the Essar Power Limited entered into another PPA with its
sister concern Essar Group of Companies. Under the PPA which was entered with
the Electricity Board, the Essar Power Limited as generating company was
required to declare availability of electricity to the Electricity Board to
the extent of 300 MW. Under the other PPA which was entered with the Essar
Group of Companies, the EPL was required to declare availability of
electricity to the extent of 215 MW to Essar Group of Companies.
4\. As per the original notification which was issued by Government of India
on 30.03.1992, the generating company ZA Page 3 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of
2009 was entitled to deemed generation incentive. However, the Central
Government, on 06.11.1995, issued a notification with the modification
cancelling the deemed generation incentives to the generating company which
was using Neptha as a fuel.
5\. As indicated above, the EPL has to declare availability of electricity to
the extent of 300 MW to the Electricity Board and 215 MW to its sister
concern, Essar Steel. The Electricity Board felt that instead of showing the
availability of 300 MW to the Electricity Board, the EPL had been supplying
more power to its sister concern, i.e. Essar Group of Companies in
contravention of the PPA entered with the Electricity Board. In view of the
said situation with regard to the contravention of the PPA and with the issue
of the fresh notification issued on 06.11.1995 by the Central Government, the
Electricity Board held a meeting with the EPL in respect of both the issues
i.e. in respect of the diversion of power as well as in respect of the ZA Page
4 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 payment towards the deemed generation
incentives. In the said meeting, the Electricity Board claimed both
compensations from EPL on account of such wrongful diversion of more power to
its sister concern and also claimed for the return of the deemed generation
incentive which was not payable to the Essar Power Limited which is Naptha
based power plant. The Electricity Board sought adjustment of the said deemed
generation incentive already paid by it to the EPL. However, there were no
fruitful results. Under those circumstances, the Electricity Board on the
advice of the State Government approached the State Commission and filed a
petition before the State Commission for the required reliefs.
6\. After hearing the parties, the State Commission ultimately allowed the
Application filed by the Electricity Board by the order dated 18.02.2009, and
granted the reliefs in respect of both the prayers, sought for by the
Electricity ZA Page 5 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 Board. However, the
claim in respect of the compensation and return of the deemed generation
incentive in respect of the period prior to 3 years from the date of filing of
the application was rejected on the ground of limitation. But, it allowed the
said claim for 3 years for the subsequent periods i.e. 3 years period i.e.
prior to the date of filing of the petition before the State Commission.
7\. Aggrieved by the rejection of the claim in respect of the earlier period
prior to 3 years from the date of filing of the petition, the Electricity
Board i.e. at present Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited has filed the Appeal
No. 77 of 2009. Aggrieved by the very same order, the EPL, with regard to the
claim of the Electricity Board in respect of compensation and to the
adjustment of the incentive for 3 years, has filed the Appeal No. 86 of 2009
before this Tribunal. ZA Page 6 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
8\. Let us now first take the Appeal No. 77 of 2009 which has been filed by
the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) The Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam has
challenged the following findings rendered by the State Commission as against
the erstwhile Electricity Board.
(i) The State Commission on the ground of limitation did not allow the claims
of the Electricity Board consequent to the decision taken with regard to the
compensation and the adjustment of deemed generation incentive in respect of
the period prior to 14.09.2002.
(ii) The State Commission held that the settlement by the payment of Rs. 64
crores made by the EPL to the Electricity Board in November 2004 would amount
to full and final settlement of the claims of the Electricity Board in respect
of diversion. ZA Page 7 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
9\. These two findings have been challenged in this Appeal No. 77 of 2009 by
the Electricity Board. The Appellant would urge the following contentions.
(i) The EPL is a generating company. The Electricity Board is a deemed
licensee. The PPA between the EPL and the Electricity Board relates to the
generation station of EPL with an installed capacity totaling 515 MW. The two
PPAs; the first between the EPL and Electricity Board at 30.05.1996 and the
second between the EPL and its sister concern, Essar Steel dated 29.06.1996
cover those entire 515 MW capacity. Both the PPAs specifically provide not
only the capacity allocated to the Electricity Board but also the capacity
allocated to its sister concern. Both the PPAs are in identical terms i.e. 300
MW of electricity to the Electricity Board and 215 MW of power to Essar Steel
in the combined cycle operation. In terms of the PPA between the EPL and the
Electricity Board, the EPL would recover full fixed charges including Return
on Equity proportionate to 58% from the Electricity Board on annual basis at
70% Plant Load Factor (PLF) As per PPA dated ZA Page 8 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77
and 86 of 2009 30.05.1996 and dated 29.06.1996 entered into with both the
parties, the EPL was required to make available electricity generated or
proposed to be generated to the Electricity Board as well as to its sister
concern in the proportion of 58:42 percent i.e. 300 MW and 215 MW
respectively. In this case, the EPL in contravention of the PPAs declared the
availability of electricity to the Electricity Board less than 300 MW and on
the other hand declared the availability of electricity to its sister concern
Essar Steels Ltd. more than the permitted limit of 215 MW and supplied the
same. This is the finding of the State Commission. Having found so, the State
Commission ought to have imposed compensation for the entire period. This was
not done on the ground of limitation. This is not legal.
(ii) There was no full and final settlement when the letter dated 19.12.2003
was written by the Electricity Board to the EPL settling the claims. A
supplemental agreement was signed in December 2003. Again another supplemental
agreement was signed in October with the Electricity Board. These supplemental
agreements dealt only with the issues ZA Page 9 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of
2009 which required amendment of the PPA. It did not deal with the issues
which required any other amendments. The amount of Rs. 64 crore settled in
October 2004 was limited to quantum of electricity declared available by EPL
in favour of the Essar Steels Ltd. in excess of the 215 MW in absolute terms
and not for any other claims. In fact, through their letter dated 22.10.2003,
the Electricity Board wrote to EPL raising a claim of Rs. 537 crores after
fuel adjustments for deemed generation incentive and deemed non-generation
relating to the power from 1996-97 to 1998-99 involving 165 million units
diverted in favour of Essar Steels Ltd.. Through its letter dated 29.07.2004,
the Electricity Board claimed from the EPL Rs. 64 crores only in regard to the
supply made by the EPL to the Essar Steels Ltd. more than 215 MW during the 3
months. Again the Electricity Board wrote another letter dated 13.10.2004
claiming Rs. 64 crores from the EPL for the energy diverted to the Essar
Steels Limited by the EPL in excess of the 215 MW. Thus, it is clear that this
would not relate to the entire settlement of overall package, and as such
there is no question of ZA Page 10 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
settlement of Rs. 64 crores being treated as full and final settlement of all
claims of the Electricity Board. Therefore, the findings by the State
Commission are wrong.
10\. These contentions urged by the Ld. Counsel for the Appellant i.e. the
Electricity Board are strongly refuted by the Ld. Senior Counsel of the
Respondent (Essar Power Limited) in justification of the findings rendered by
the State Commission in favour of EPL, by showing the reasoning given in the
impugned order.
11\. We have heard the counsel for the parties and we have given our anxious
consideration to their rival contentions.
12\. As mentioned above, the State Commission by the impugned order dated
18.02.2009 had accepted the contention of the Appellant on merits with
reference to the claim on both the issues namely in regard to the entitlement
of Electricity ZA Page 11 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 Board to get
proportionate share of 300 MW of power out of the total 515 MW capacity and on
the issue of inadmissibility of deemed generation incentive to the EPL which
is Neptha plant. However, the State Commission has held against the Appellant,
the Electricity Board on the following issues.
(i) the claim for alleged wrongful diversion of power for the period prior to
14.09.2002 is barred by limitation;
(ii) The claim of inadmissibility of deemed generation incentive for the
period prior to 14.09.2002 was barred by limitation;
(iii) The Appellant had fully and finally settled all its claims in regard to
wrongful diversion of power in excess of 215 MW by the EPL to its sister
concern Essar Group Companies up to the year 2004.
13\. These findings are being challenged in this Appeal. ZA Page 12 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
14\. In the light of the respective contentions urged by the Learned Counsel
for the parties, the following questions may arise for consideration in this
Appeal:
> (i) Whether the State Commission was right in holding that the claim of the
> Appellant with reference to the deemed generation incentive as well as
> wrongful allocation of the capacity for the period prior to 14.09.2002 could
> be said to be barred by limitation;
> (ii) Whether the State Commission was right in considering the letters dated

> September 2004 in excess of 215 MW was settled by the parties against Rs. 64
> crores as claimed by the EPL? ZA Page 13 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
> 15\. The short and simple point urged by the Appellant in the present Appeal

> allocation of power for the period prior to 14.09.2002 on the ground that

> would be entitled to claim as against the EPL (R-2).
16\. It is not in dispute that there was a PPA dated 30.05.1996 made between
the erstwhile Electricity Board, the predecessor of the Appellant and the
Essar Power Limited, respondent herein. Under this PPA, the EPL agreed to sell
electricity to the Electricity Board up to allocated capacity of 300 MW on the
terms and conditions contained in the PPA. In the same very year i.e. on
29.06.96 the EPL entered into another PPA with its sister concern i.e. Essar
Steel Limited. Under this PPA, the EPL agreed to sell to Essar Steel Limited,
its sister concern up ZA Page 14 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 to the
allocated capacity of 215 MW on the terms and conditions contained in the said
PPA.
17\. It is the case of the Appellant, that EPL is liable to declare and supply
power in the ratio of 300:215 MW to the Appellant and to the Essar Steel
Limited respectively. It is the further case of the Appellant that the EPL has
not declared and supplied power in the said ratio to the Appellant, but on the
other hand, the EPL has supplied more power to its sister concern Essar Steel
Limited than its entitlement under the PPA by diverting the power meant for
supply to the Appellant and thereby caused loss to the Appellant for which the
Appellant would be entitled to compensation. It is the further case of the
Appellant that as per notification dated 06.09.1995, the demands made by the
Appellant to the EPL towards deemed generation incentive during the
eligibility period of 10 ZA Page 15 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 years
i.e. from 01.07.1996 to 30.05.2006 is refundable to the Appellant by the EPL
as the EPL was a Neptha based plant.
18\. Let us now discuss these issues.
19\. It is not in dispute that when the claim towards compensation for wrong
allocation of power as well as the claims for refund of deemed generation
incentive were made by the Electricity Board through the letter dated
29.10.2003 the EPL refuted the same immediately through, the letters dated
01.11.2003 and 01.12.2003. Despite that, the Appellant approached the State
Commission and filed a petition only on 14.09.2005 for recovery of the said
amounts due on account of the 2 claims. In those circumstances, the question
arises as to whether the said claims by the Appellant against EPL was barred
by the limitation?. Though EPL submitted before the State Commission that all
the claims of the Appellants are ZA Page 16 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of
2009 barred by limitation, but at the end, the EPL confined itself to the
question of limitation only to the claims of the Appellant in respect of the
period prior to 14.09.2002 i.e. before 3 years prior to the date of petition
i.e. 14.09.2005. This contention urged by the Respondent EPL was upheld by the
State Commission holding that the Appellant would be entitled to get the
amount refunded only to its claim for the 3 years period prior to the date of
filing of the petition and not for the earlier period.
20\. Admittedly, the petition had been filed by the Appellant before the State
Commission seeking compensation on account of alleged breach of contract.
According to the Appellant the terms of the contract contained in PPA have
been broken from the date of the alleged failure on the part of EPL to declare
and supply power in the ratio of 300:215 MW to the Appellant as well as to its
sister company. Even according to the Appellant ZA Page 17 of 63 Appeal Nos.
77 and 86 of 2009 such a breach had not taken place once but several times. It
is thus a case in which contract has been breached successively.
21\. It cannot be disputed that the provisions of Limitation Act 1963 applies
to the present case. Article 55 of the Limitation Act is relevant. Article 55
provides for filing of the suit for compensation for the breach of any
contract, express or implied. According to this Article the period of
limitation is 3 years. This Article further says that when the contract is
broken or where there are successive breaches, then the breach in respect of
which suit is instituted occurs. Under these circumstances, the above Article
applies to the present case and as per the same, the period of limitation for
compensation for breach of contract is 3 years from the date when the contract
is broken or where there are successive breaches. It is a settled law that
once a period of limitation prescribed for suit begins to run, it is not
stopped.
ZA Page 18 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
22\. The claim made by the Appellant (Electricity Board) for the payment of
Rs. 537 crores from EPL for the period from 01.07.1996 to 31.03.1999 through
their letter dated 29.10.2003 was specifically denied by the EPL through their
letters dated 01.11.2003 and 01.12.2003. Thus, it is clear that the cause of
action for compensation on account of alleged diversion of power arose in July
1996 itself and at any rate it arose when the Demand Notice dated 29.10.2003
was issued and the same was refuted on 01.11.2003 and 01.12.2003. Under those
circumstances, the State Commission in our view rightly held that the claims
of the Appellant for the said compensation and for the refund of the said
deemed generation incentive pertaining to any period prior to 3 years from the
date of the filing of the petition before the State Commission i.e. on
14.09.2005 are clearly barred by limitation. ZA Page 19 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
23\. It is a settled law that mere correspondence with the parties would not
extend the cause of action or suspend the period of limitation. The
discussions and negotiations held between the parties for a possible
settlement even by way of conciliation as a prelude to arbitration will not
stop the cause of action accruing to the party by the reason of denial of a
claim, nor such cause of action once accrued gets extended or suspended by the
period during which the efforts for an amicable settlement were in progress.
The State Commission held so in the light of the facts admitted by the parties
and also in view of the well settled legal principle on computation of
compensation.
24\. It is contended by the Appellant that the State Commission has erred in
distinguishing the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of
Hari Shanker Singhania v. Gaur Hari Singhania (2006) Vol-4 SCC 658 and ZA Page
20 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 Shree Ram Mills v. Utility Premises
Ltd. (2007) Vol-IV SCC 599 wherein it was held that where the negotiations
were still on there would be no question of starting of the limitation period.
These decisions relied upon by the Appellant do no deal with the case in which
a cause of action to suit had already accrued to a person before the
negotiations were held. As mentioned above, the limitation once commences to
run, it does not stop. The cause of action once accrued is neither extended
nor suspended due to such negotiations or conciliations. Such cause of action
occurs when a claim made by one party against another and the same is denied
or refuted by the other. Therefore, it cannot be contended that the cause of
action for the Appellant for approaching the State Commission continued till
the order was passed by the Government of Gujarat on 27.07.2007 advising the
Appellant to resolve this dispute through the State Commission.
ZA Page 21 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
25\. Further, the decisions cited by the Ld. Counsel for the Appellant under
article 137 of the Limitation Act would apply only to the Application and not
to the suit. The petition in question filed before the State Commission being
one in the nature of a suit would attract Article 55 and as per the same, the
petition is barred by time with respect to the claims made by the Appellant,
with regard to the period prior to 3 years prior to the filing of the petition
on the alleged wrong allocation of power and deemed generation incentive.
26\. In view of the discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs we feel that
there is no merit in this Appeal. In our considered opinion, the State
Commission has given a clear and categorical finding with reference to the
period of limitation and has rightly held that the Appellant's claim against
the EPL for any period up to 14.09.2002 i.e. 3 years period prior to filing of
the petition are barred by time except ZA Page 22 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86
of 2009 to the extent of Rs. 64 crores paid by the EPL to the Appellant
pursuant to the full and final settlement of ll claims for the period from
1998 up to September 2004. In this context, we would like to mention that in
regard to the full and final settlement, we would make further discussion in
the other Appeal.
27\. Therefore there is no merit in this Appeal and as such the Appeal No. 77
of 2009 filed by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. is dismissed as devoid of
merits.
No costs.
Appeal No. 86 of 2009
28\. Let us now deal with the other Appeal No. 86 of 2009. This Appeal has
been filed by Essar Power Limited, as Appellant, as against the impugned order
dated 18.02.2009 holding in favour of the erstwhile Electricity Board (R-1) in
respect of 2 issues. It is better to again recall and reiterate the ZA Page 23
of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 minimal facts which are required for
understanding the issues that arise in this Appeal.
29\. Essar Power Limited, the Appellant, is a generating company. As mentioned
above on 30.05.1996, the Appellant entered into a Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA) with the erstwhile Gujarat Electricity Board (Electricity Board) (R-1).
It also entered into a separate PPA on 29.06.1996 with its sister concern,
Essar Steels Ltd. The terms of these PPAs meant that the Appellant, out of the
total generating capacity of 515 MW would allocate 300 MW to the Electricity
Board (R-1) and 215 MW to the Essar Steel Limited, its sister concern. The
said Electricity Board felt aggrieved that the Appellant did not maintain the
ratio of 300:215 to be allocated to the Electricity Board (R-1) and its sister
concern and on the other hand the Appellant supplied less than the allocated
ratio to the Electricity Board but supplied electricity more than its ZA Page
24 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 allocated ratio to its sister concern.
The Electricity Board (R-1) claimed compensation on that account. It also
demanded for return of the deemed generation incentive which was earlier paid
to the Appellant since the Appellant was not entitled to get the incentive, as
per the Notification dated 06.11.1995. On these issues the Electricity Board
(R-1) filed a petition before the State Commission. The State Commission,
after hearing the parties, gave the following findings in favour of the
Electricity Board (R-1)
(i) The total capacity of the Appellant is 515 MW. The Appellant is liable to
make allocation of available power in the ratio of 300 MW and 215 MW to the
Electricity Board (R-1) and Essar Steel Ltd. respectively. This has not been
done. On the contrary the Appellant supplied more than the allocated ratio to
its sister concern and supplied less than the allocated ratio to the
Electricity Board. Hence the ZA Page 25 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
Appellant is liable to pay compensation for a period of 3 years prior to the
date of filing of the petition before the State Commission.
(ii) On the issue of inadmissibility of deemed generation incentive, the State
Commission held that the Notification dated 06.11.1995 issued by the
Government of India would apply to the Appellant's company as this is based on
the use of Naptha as fuel and as such they are not entitled to the deemed
generation incentive and the same is liable to be returned.
30\. Assailing these grounds, the Ld. Senior Counsel for the Appellant EPL
would make the following contentions:
> (i) There is no specific provision in the PPA dated 30.05.1996 entered into
> between the EPL and the Electricity Board (R-1) which obligates the
> Appellant ZA Page 26 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 to declare and

> submissions:
> (i) The State Commission by its impugned order has given clear and

33\. In the light of the above pleas made by the respective parties, the
following questions may arise for consideration:
> (i) Whether under the PPA I and II the supply of electrical output to be
> made by the Appellant shall be in the ratio of 300:215 MW, the allocated
> capacity of the Electricity Board (R-1) and Essar Steels Ltd. respectively?
> (ii) Whether the Appellant, which failed to declare the entire capacity of

> electricity to its sister concern Essar Steels Ltd. in excess of the said
> ratio is liable to be held responsible for the breach of ZA Page 33 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 the terms of PPA and consequently the
> Appellant is liable to compensate the Electricity Board (R-1)
> (iii) Whether the Electricity Board (R-1) is entitled to get the refund from
> the Appellant for the deemed generation incentive paid to the Appellant in
> view of the amended Notification dated 06.11.1995?
34\. Let us now deal with these issues.
35\. To resolve this dispute, it would be necessary to refer to the various
articles in the PPA dated 30.05.1996 (PPA-1) entered into between the
Appellant (EPL) and the Electricity Board (R-1).
36\. Under Article 3.2, a positive obligation has been imposed on the
Appellant (EPL) to deliver power to the Electricity Board at the delivery
point in accordance with its dispatch ZA Page 34 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86
of 2009 instructions issued by the Electricity Board under the dispatch
procedures as specified under Schedule-VI.
37\. Article 3.3 deals with the Electricity power availability. It provides
that the EPL shall submit to the Electricity Board from time to time Declared
Available Generation Capacity as per the procedures set forth in Schedule-VI.
38\. Article 6.1 of Schedule-VI states that the EPL will submit to the Board
Load Despatch Centre a Weekly Schedule indicating the time and capacity which
will be available from the generating station, and if not available, it shall
mention the reason for the same.
39\. It is significant to point out the words "corresponding to the allocated
capacity" as found in Article 3.1 are not appearing in this article. In such
circumstances, the question ZA Page 35 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
would arise as to whether the EPL is obliged to declare available capacity in
the said ratio to the Electricity Board 300 MW and Essar Steels Ltd. 215 MW,
in the absence of these words in this article?
40\. "Declaring available generating capacity" has been defined in Article 1
of PPA. It means the generating capacity expressed in MW at the Delivery Point
as declared by the company, i.e. EPL pursuant to Schedule VI to be made
available to the Electricity Board up to the allocated capacity.
41\. Schedule-VI to the PPA-1 contained provision in regard to Despatch
Procedures. As per Article 6.1, as indicated above, the EPL is required to
submit to the Board Load Despatch Centre Weekly Schedules. There is nothing in
this article to suggest that the declaration of capacity is to be on a
proportionate basis to the Electricity Board as well as to the ZA Page 36 of
63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 Essar Steel Ltd. After the EPL submitted its
Weekly Schedule, the Electricity Board shall issue to the EPL a Schedule of
its requirement vide article 6.2.
42\. Thereafter as per Article 6.3 the Board may issue Despatch Instructions
at any time after the issue of Schedule of its requirement.
43\. Article 6.4 provides that the EPL shall operate the generating station in
accordance with the relevant Despatch Instructions given by the Board from
time to time subject to Article 3.3.
44\. As aforesaid Article 3.3 deals with the availability of declared capacity
which also does not oblige the EPL to declare on proportionate basis.
ZA Page 37 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
45\. From these provisions of Schedule-VI, it is clear that there is no
provision, express or implied, to suggest that the EPL is liable to declare
the available capacity in the said ratio to the Board and the Essar Steels
Ltd. All these provisions would only say that the EPL has to first give Weekly
Schedules to the Electricity Board indicating the time and capacity which
would be available and the Electricity Board shall thereafter issue its
requirement schedule through Despatch Instructions and thereupon EPL is liable
to operate generating station in accordance with the Despatch Instructions
given by the Electricity Board and supply.
46\. On a combined reading of Articles 1 and 3 and Schedule- VI of the PPA-1,
it is clear that EPL has to declare available capacity up to the allocated
capacity to both the Electricity Board as well as to Essar Steels Ltd. and not
on proportionate theory basis.
ZA Page 38 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
47\. As a matter of fact, Article 5.2 of the PPA-1 obligates the Electricity
Board to pay to the Appellant its Annual Fixed Charges including the cost of
the project on the level of generation achieved up to the allocated capacity
and not on the allocated capacity itself. The Electricity Board has
accordingly paid the Annual Fixed Charges on monthly basis on the level of
generation achieved up to the allocated capacity.
48\. It is pointed out by the Ld. Senior Counsel for the Appellant that so far
as the payment towards cost of the project is concerned, the Electricity Board
had agreed to pay Rs. 945 crores out of the total cost of the project
amounting to Rs. 2061 crores which only comes to approximately 46%, i.e. less
than 58% of the total project cost.
ZA Page 39 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
49\. In such circumstances, the Electricity Board (R-1) cannot claim that by
reasons of it's making payment for the Annual Fixed Charges up to the
allocated capacity, it was always obligatory on the part of the EPL to supply
power to the extent of 58% to the Electricity Board and that since EPL has
sold a part of Electricity Board's share in the power generated by the EPL to
its sister concern, EPL is liable to compensate the Electricity Board for the
same by treating such power which sold by EPL to Essar Steel Ltd. as if it was
sold by the Electricity Board itself to Essar Steel Ltd. after purchasing the
same from the EPL.
50\. On the basis of letters dated 17.02.2000 and 04.10.2001, it is contended
on behalf of the Electricity Board (R-1) that EPL has conceded to its
proportionate theory basis and as such it cannot go back. This contention is
not tenable. EPL in those letters merely expressed its willingness to agree to
the ZA Page 40 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 proportionate theory basis
subject to the condition that Electricity Board should commit default in
making the payment of dues payable under the PPA-1 to EPL and also subject to
the condition that the Electricity Board shall comply with other conditions of
the PPA-1.
51\. Admittedly, the stipulated conditions in those letters were neither
accepted nor complied with by the Electricity Board. Hence the offer made by
the EPL to the Electricity Board for agreeing to the proportionate theory
basis would not be construed to be conceding and as such it is binding on it.
52\. In the second letter dated 04.10.2001 also, EPL stipulated the condition
of making prompt payments by the Electricity Board to EPL and for
establishment of Letter of Credit to secure payments under PPA-1. Even this
condition, the Electricity Board was not ready to comply with. As such the ZA
Page 41 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 proposal made by the EPL to the
Electricity Board regarding proportionate theory subject to the conditions is
not binding on the Appellant.
53\. Furthermore, when there is an amendment to the PPA-1 on 18.12.2003, there
is no reference about these amendments for declaration of supply of power in
the ratio of 58:42 to the Electricity Board as well as to the Essar Steels
Ltd. respectively. The preamble of the said Supplemental Agreement dated
18.12.2003 clearly establishes that EPL is only obliged to generate the
electricity up to 300 MW allocated to the Electricity Board and nothing more.
In other words, there is no amendment with regard to the declaration of
electricity generated on proportionate basis in the said Supplemental
Agreement dated 18.12.2003. ZA Page 42 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
54\. Under such circumstances, it is not open to the Electricity Board to rely
upon the aforesaid letters dated 17.02.2000 and 04.10.2001 to advance the plea
of its proportionate theory.
55\. It is an admitted fact that the Electricity Board through its letter
dated 29.10.2003 demanded from EPL the payment of an aggregate amount of Rs.
537 crores on account of alleged diversion of power by EPL to Essar Steels Ltd
for the period commencing from 01.07.1996 to 31st March 1999. It is also an
admitted fact that the parties thereafter held several rounds of discussions
and as a result of those discussions, a settlement was actually arrived at by
the parties in October 2004. Pursuant to the said settlement, the Electricity
Board recalculated the amount, due on the basis of power supplied by the EPL
to Essar Steels Ltd in excess of the allocated capacity of 215 MW shall alone
be treated as sold and supplied by the Electricity Board. On this basis, the
Electricity Board itself ZA Page 43 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
furnished a statement to the Appellant, EPL showing that a sum of Rs. 64
crores is payable for the aforesaid period and on the aforesaid basis, the EPL
accepted the same as a part of overall package and authorized the Electricity
Board to recover the same on a condition that the same methodology would be
adopted in future also. Thereafter, through their letter dated 13.10.2006, the
Electricity Board accepted to receive Rs. 64 crores for diverting the
electricity to the Essar Steels Ltd.
56\. Under those circumstances, it is clear that the claim of the Electricity
Board against the EPL with respect to the alleged diversion of power by the
EPL to Essar Steels Ltd. for the period from 01.07.96 had already been settled
by the payment and this settlement is final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. As correctly observed by the State Commission, the same is not liable
to be reopened at this stage. ZA Page 44 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
57\. Admittedly, it is not established that there is any breach of the
contract as the part of the Appellant under PPA-1 on account of non-
declaration of available capacity to the Electricity Board on proportionate
basis. The compensation can be claimed only when there is a breach and due to
the same there was a loss or damage caused by the said breach of contract.
This has to be pleaded and proved. Unless this is done, no compensation can be
claimed. This is a settled law as held by the Supreme Court in (1974) Vol-2
SCC 231 - Raman Foundry V/s Union of India.
58\. In the present case, the Electricity Board has not pleaded and proved the
actual loss or damage caused to it due to the alleged breach of contract. The
principle enshrined in section 73 of the Contract Act has been incorporated in
Article 10.1 of the PPA-1 which reads as follows:
ZA Page 45 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 "......neither Party shall be liable to the
> other Party in contract, trot, warranty, strict liability or any other any
> other legal theory for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or
> exemplary damages. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party
> except pursuant to, or for breach of this Agreement, provided, however, that
> this provision is not intended to constitute a waiver of any rights of one
> Party against the other with regard to matters related to this Agreement or
> any activity contemplated by this Agreement".
> 59\. Similarly, the explanation to Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act
> provides that in estimating the loss or damage arising from breach of
> contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by
> the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account. It is the
> duty of the court to take into account whether the party affected by breach
> ZA Page 46 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 of contract has performed its
> duty to mitigate the loss while estimating the loss or damage arising from
> the breach of contract. In the present case, the Electricity Board merely
> pleads that EPL has failed to declare and supply the available capacity of
> electricity on proportionate basis to the Electricity Board and nothing
> more.
60\. As indicated above, as per Article 3.2 of PPA-1, the EPL becomes liable
to deliver the capacity to the Electricity Board at the delivery point in
accordance with the Despatch Instructions. The Despatch Instructions are
instructions for delivery of electricity. The principle contained in Article
3.2 of PPA-1 is in terms of the provisions of Section 35 of the Sale of Goods
Act, 1920. Section 35 of the Sale of Goods Act declares that the seller of
goods is not bound to deliver until the buyer applies for the delivery.
ZA Page 47 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
61\. As mentioned above, the explanation of Section 73 casts a duty to
mitigate loss on the person affected by breach of contract committed by
another.
62\. In other words, assuming that the EPL has committed a breach of contract,
the Electricity Board as the purchaser of electricity was under duty-bound to
mitigate the loss arising from such a breach.
63\. It is the case of the Electricity Board that it was aware of the breach
of the contract by EPL from inception of the PPA-1. Such being the position,
the Electricity Board was obliged to apply to the Appellant for delivery of
electricity calculated on the proportionate theory basis so as to mitigate the
loss. The Electricity Board has not even attempted to establish that it had
done so.
ZA Page 48 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
64\. Let us now refer to some of the decisions on this aspect cited by the
learned senior counsel for the Appellant.
65\. Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in (1977) 3 SCC 474 - Timblo Irmaos Ltd.,
Margo versus Jorge Anibal Matos Sequeira and Another - as follows:
> "When the appellant itself had committed breaches of its obligations, it is
> difficult to see how the respondents could be made responsible for the delay
> in loading. We think that the Judicial Commissioner had rightly disallowed
> this part of the claim".
66\. In AIR 1936 Privy Council 236 - Tsn Ah Boon Versus State of Johore - The
Privy Council has held as under:
> "The plaintiff claiming damage for breach of an alleged contract cannot
> maintain the action unless he can aver and prove that he has performed or
> has at all times been ready to perform his part of the contract." ZA Page 49
> of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 "Where certain land granted to the plaintiff
> by the State on condition of his paying rent is sold by the State by reason
> of his failure to pay rent, and, the plaintiff brings a suit for breach of
> contract, he is not entitled to any damages owing to his default in payment
> of rent."
67\. In AIR (1964) Madras 508 - State of Madras Versus Venkataraman,. - the
court has held as follows:
> "This apart, even assuming that there was a valid contract, it will be seen
> that the defendant himself was in breach, not having paid for the price of
> the good within the stipulated time. In fact, he was in arrears to a
> considerable extent. A purchaser of goods like the defendant who commits
> default in his obligation to pay for the good within 15 days of the delivery
> thereof cannot be heard to complain that the plaintiff committed breach in
> withholding supply."
> ZA Page 50 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
> 68\. The Ld. Counsel for the Appellant cited another decision AIR (AP) 1958
> - 533 - Dhulipudi Namayya Versus Union of India - to show that no
> compensation claim for any remedy or indirect loss. The relevant portion is
> as follows:
> "The plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant in the words of S.
> 73 of the Contract Act, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him by
> the breach, which naturally arose in usual course of things from such a
> breach or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely
> to result from the breach of it, but not for any remote and indirect loss of
> damage sustained by reasons of the breach."
> > 69\. The Appellant cited two more decisions to substantiate the plea that
> measure of damages cannot be the profit which the defendant might have made.
> ZA Page 51 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
70\. AIR (1950) Madras 289 - M. Maniappa Pillai Versus I. Anthanisami Mudaliar
and others - The relevant observation of Madras High Court is as follows:
> "What then is the relief that the plaintiff is entitled to? He is entitled
> to damages for breach of contract. The measures of such damages cannot be
> the profit which defendant might have made by trading with the goods he
> obtained as the quota for the firm. Damages for breach of contract are
> intended to recompense the plaintiff to the pecuniary loss that he has
> sustained and do not depend upon the gain that the other party might have
> made. There is no material furnished by the parties to the Court to assess
> damages for this standpoint, namely, the loss sustained by the plaintiff."
> ZA Page 52 of 63
> Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
> 71\. In (1962) 1 SCR 653 - Murlidhar Chiranjilal Versus Harishchandra
> Dwarkadas, the Supreme Court has held as follows:
> "The two principles on which damages in such cases are calculated are well-
> settled. The first is that, as far as possible, he who has proved a breach
> of a bargain to supply what he contracted to get is to be placed, as far as
> money can do it, in as good a situation as if the contract had been
> performed; but this principle is qualified by a second, which imposes on a
> plaintiff the duty of taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss
> consequent on the breach and debars him from claiming any part of the
> damages which is due to his neglect to take such steps."
> 72\. Another decision cited is in AIR 1974 (2) SCC 231 -
Raman Iron Foundry Vs. Union of India to show the claim for un-liquidated
damages does not give rise to a debt until ZA Page 53 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and
86 of 2009 liability adjudicated. The relevant portion of the decision is as
follows;
> "It, therefore, makes no difference in the present case that the claim of
> the appellant is for liquidated damages. It stands on the same footing as a
> claim for un-liquidated damages. Now the law is well settled that a claim
> for un- liquidated damages not give rise to a debt until the liability is
> adjudicated and damages assessed by a decree or order of a Court or other
> adjudicatory authority.
73\. The ratio propounded in these decisions, in our view, would squarely
apply to the present fact of the case, in the light of the fact that
Electricity Board has failed to satisfy the Mandatory requirements to claim
compensation.
74\. One more aspect needs to be mentioned. The arrangement in relation to
supply of electricity up to the ZA Page 54 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
allocated capacity of 300 MW between the Appellant EPL and the Electricity
Board under the PPA-1 and between the EPL and its sister concern Essar Steels
Ltd. under PPA-2 read with Fuel Management Agreement dated 18.10.1996 are
materially different. The Essar Steels Ltd supplies fuel to EPL for conversion
into electricity, whereas the Electricity Board is under no obligation to
supply fuel to EPL. Admittedly, the EPL has to procure fuel from outside and
use it for generating electricity for sale to the Electricity Board.
75\. The PPA-1 is a contract between the EPL and the Electricity Board
containing reciprocal promises. In consideration of EPL supplying electricity
to the Electricity Board up to the allocated capacity in accordance with the
Despatch Instructions, the Electricity Board had agreed and undertaken to pay
the EPL the tariff as mentioned in the PPA-
1\. It is an admitted fact that the Electricity Board has ZA Page 55 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 committed default in making payment when due to
be made to the EPL under the PPA-1. In fact, the EPL, the Appellant has
produced materials to show that at one point of time in March 2008, the
aggregate amount due to EPL was to the tune of Rs. 519 crores. EPL has
produced documents to show that the Electricity Board is a defaulter in making
payment of its due under the PPA-1 right from the inception of it.
76\. It is also an admitted fact that EPL had written several letters to the
Electricity Board to establish Letter of Credit to secure the payment of the
amount payable under PPA-1 and also pay the amounts when due. But the
Electricity Board did not heed to the request made by the EPL in this behalf
and as a result of it the ability of EPL to purchase the fuel for generating
electricity meant for sale to the Electricity Board got impaired.
ZA Page 56 of 63
Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
77\. As mentioned above, the claim for compensation made by the Electricity
Board against EPL in the present case is due to the alleged breach of contract
by EPL in declaring and supplying the power to the Electricity Board in the
proportion of 300MW out of the total capacity 515 MW. The grievance is that
EPL has supplied less power than what is due to the Electricity Board under
the PPA-1. As aforesaid, Article 3.2 of the PPA-1 obliges the Appellant to
supply electricity to the Electricity Board only in accordance with the
Despatch Instructions given by the Electricity Board from time to time. As a
matter of fact, there is no provision in the PPA-1 which restricts the right
of the Electricity Board to demand for supply of electricity only up to the
declared available capacity of the EPL. Admittedly, many a times the
Electricity Board asked for supply of more quantum of electricity than what
was declared as available to it by the EPL by revising its Despatch ZA Page 57
of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 Instructions and immediately thereafter
the EPL met this demand.
78\. Whenever EPL was not able to meet such revised demand, the EPL
compensated the Electricity Board by paying Deemed non-Generation Charges.
79\. Under PPA-1, the liability of the Appellant is only to pay penalty by way
of Deemed Non-Generation Charges for the non-supply of the quantum of the
demand. No other penalty or charges or compensation is leviable for any
shortfall in the supply of electricity under the provision of PPA-1. The claim
for compensation made in the petition is not for the recovery of the unpaid
Deemed Non-Generation Charges.
80\. It is also to be pointed out in this context that admittedly there is no
tripartite agreement between these 3 parties which ZA Page 58 of 63 Appeal
Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 binds all these parties. As such, there is no
restriction on the EPL for supply of power to the Essar Steels Ltd in excess
of the maximum allocated capacity of 215 MW. In fact, Article 6.10.2 provides
a right to EPL to sell electrical output to other utility/utilities in the
event the Electricity Board does not cure its Event of Default before the
expiry of the Cure Period.
81\. In the light of the above position, the direction given by the State
Commission with reference to reimbursement of Annual Fixed Charges to the
Electricity Board when the Electricity Board has not secured energy to the
extent allocated under the proportionate principle is not correct as the same
is misconceived. In this case we are of the view that the Annual Fixed Charges
are not refundable for the surrendered portion of the electricity to the
person in whose favour such electricity is surrendered. Hence, in regard to
the issue relating to the liability to pay compensation we hold that, in
Electricity Board ZA Page 59 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009 is not
entitled to get the compensation as claimed and as such the Appellant EPL
succeeds in this issue. Consequently the findings given by the State
Commission on this issue are set aside.
82\. Now we will deal with the question whether the Electricity Board has a
right to demand refund of the Deemed Generation Incentive as per Notification
dated 06.11.1995.
83\. The argument advanced by the Appellant is that the Notification applies
only to a Naptha based generating station and not to a gas based generating
station and as such the Notification dated 06.11.1995 will not apply to a
generating station like the Appellant station where Naptha is used only as an
alternative fuel. We are unable to accept this contentions. Admittedly, the
EPL had established its generating station principally based on the gas and
Naptha as fuel. This is clear ZA Page 60 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
from the communication dated 31.08.1998, 09.02.1998 and 21.03.1998. The main
contention urged by the Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant is that
Notification was issued on 06.11.1995 and Agreement was entered into between
the parties only thereafter on 30.05.1996 and despite the same, the said PPA-1
did not refer to the prohibition of payment for the Deemed Generation
Incentive on Naptha as referred to in Notification dated 06.11.1995. This
contention also does not merit acceptance for the following reasons.
84\. The Notification dated 06.11.1995 is statutory in nature issued under
section 43A(2) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948\. Any PPA entered into
has to be consistent with the statutory notification.
85\. It is a settled law that rights and obligation of the parties under the
PPA have to be read subject to the statutory ZA Page 61 of 63 Appeal Nos. 77
and 86 of 2009 provisions. The provisions of the PPA which are contrary to the
statutory provision cannot be given effect to. This is a well established law
as held in (2000 Vol-3 SCC 379 - India- Thermal Power Ltd. V/s State of Madhya
Pradesh.
86\. One more contention raised by the Appellant is that by virtue of the
Supplemental Agreement dated 18.12.2003 the EPL agreed to reduce incentive and
therefore on an overall basis Electricity Board had been benefited and the
same is consistent with the Notification dated 30.03.1992. This contention
also is wrong because the prohibition contained in the Notification dated
06.11.1995 cannot be construed to be a norm. There is a valid public interest
involved in prohibiting the Deemed Generation Incentive under the statutory
notification. What has been prohibited directly cannot be permitted indirectly
based on the Supplemental Agreement dated 18.12.2003.

Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
87\. Therefore, with reference to the issue of the refund of the Deemed
Generation incentive we confirm the order of the State Commission. As such the
contention of the Appellant in regard to this issue would fail. However, as
indicated in earlier paragraphs, we accept the contention of the Appellant
with regard to the first issue and as such the finding given by the State
Commission in regard to the liability to pay the compensation is liable to be
set aside. Accordingly, the same is set aside.
88\. in the result, the Appeal No. 77 of 2009 filed by Gujarat Urgja Vikast
Nigam Ltd. is dismissed and the Appeal No. 86 of 2009 filed by Essar Power
Ltd. is partly allowed. No costs.
