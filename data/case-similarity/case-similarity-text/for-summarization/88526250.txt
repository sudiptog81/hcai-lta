Per Shamim Yahya (AM) :-
These are cross appeals by the assessee and Revenue arising out of the order
of learned CIT(A) dated 8.11.2017 and pertains to A.Y. 2011-12.
2\. Grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue read as under :
> 1\. "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the

> 3\. "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Id.

Assessee's appeal :
4\. M/s. Abbott Healthcare Private Limited (in short 'AHPL') is a downstream
subsidiary of M/s. Abbott Laboratories, USA. It is engaged in distribution of
healthcare products. 99.99% of AHPL shareholding is held by Abbott Asia
Holdings Ltd., which in turn is a 100% subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, USA.
On the reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO), the TPO noted that
AHPL has entered into certain international transactions with its AEs. AHPL
submitted a Transfer Pricing Study Report, which deals with the nature and
terms of international transactions and also the functional and economic
analysis of such transactions. The details of international transactions
reported by the assessee are as follows:
         Sr.   International Transactions                     Amount in      Method

GmbH& Co. KG (AE) as the assessee had entered into service center agreement
dated 09.11.2005 (supplementary agreement to the main agreement dated
01.12,1988) with the AE. It was submitted vide letter dated 19.01.2015 that
during the year, the assessee has been allocated the following sums relating
to 'Payment for Central Service Charges' viz.:-

> 6\. During tine course of assessment proceedings and vide note sheet entry

> was not convinced. He made transfer pricing adjustment of Rs. 30,265,476/-
by concluding as under :-
> "On the basis of analysis above, it can be concluded that for establishing
> that the services are actually rendered, the assessee is required to
> maintain and submit documentation and evidence. The second aspect of intra
> group services is the quantification of such services in terms of actual

> subject matter of transfer pricing. The expected benefit must sufficiently
> direct tangible and substantial which was not produced by the assessee. A
> comparable independent service recipient, under comparable circumstances,
> would not be willing to pay for that service. If the has received the
> service, assessee has to maintain proper documentation. In its letter dated
> 19-01-2015, the only explanation as regards quantification of the benefits
> in respect of personnel support services was that the salary cost of one
> human resource manager and one human resource officer is not incurred by the
> local affiliate, which based on the understanding made available could be
> around Rs.25 to 30 lakhs as today's cost as discussed in para 5.7 above and
> the value of international re packages for Accounting, Finance and MIS
> Software that was made available and customized to assessee's requirements
> by Abbott GmbH could be anywhere more than Rs. 1 crore as per today's cost.
> Accordingly, the arm's length value of payment made towards central service
> charges (Personnel support and Accounting, Finance and MIS support)is
> considered as Rs. 8,479,431 /- and therefore adjustment of Rs. 30,265,467 /-
> to the total income of the assessee is proposed."
5 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
7\. Upon assessee's appeal learned CIT(A) confirmed the TPO's action. He held
as under :-
> As per the TPO during the year the appellant has allocated following sums
> relating to "payment for Central Service charge"
            Nature of the service                       Amount in Euro   Amount in Rs.
            Marketing and strategic sales support       376,667          22,910,414
            Personnel Support                           11,551           702,549
            Training and product support                121,071          7,364,053
            Accounting finance and MIS support          127,711          7,776,882
            Total                                       637,000          38,744,898
> The assessee had submitted that payment of central service charges have been
> benchmarked by TNMM by comparing the operating results of assessee's
> distribution segments with functionally uncontrolled transactions. The TPO
> was of the view that the act does not say that TNMM is to be applied at the
> enterprise level and once TNMM is applied, all the international transaction
> are at arm's length. So just because TNMM is applied at the enterprise
> level, it does not automatically follow that each class of transaction
> including central service charges are at arm's length. The TPO has analysis
> the Central Service Charge under the CUP method. Reliance was placed in the
> case of Star India Pvt. Ltd. Vs ACIT (2008-TIOL- 426- ITAT- MUMBAI) wherein
> it was held that distinctive activities are to be analyzed separately. The
> TPO also placed reliance in the case of UCB India Pvt. Ltd (317 ITR 292
> (AT)(MUM) It is seen that the appellant has two product lines. One is
> pharmaceuticals products and the second is medical healthcare products. The
> transaction which is presently under discussion is the medical/healthcare
> business. The appellant is merely a distributor in the above furnished good.
> The TPO has elaborately discussed in his order that in the third party
> situation an assessee who is engaged in distribution function will never
> agree to make such payments as for preparing strategic plans, financial
> analysis and financial forecasting, marketing research and training support.
> The second question to consider was whether asssseee has been able to lay
> any evidence to show that these services were in fact rendered by the AE and
> availed by the assessee. It was submitted that m..... evidences were
> submitted for the first time during the course of assessment proceedings for
> AY 2011-12.
> The TPO has submitted that assessee has been able to substantiate to an
> extent the receipts of services towards personnel support services and
> accounting, finance and MIS support services based on the documentary
> evidence provided but has failed to levy any evidence to show that the wide
> no of services in relations to marketing and strategic sales. This cannot be
> charged on the distributor who is merely distributing the products. The TPO
> further contended that comparable independent services recipients, under
> comparable circumstance would not be willing to pay for that services.
6
> M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
> I have gone through the appellant's contentions and have discussed TPO's
> finding also. It is pertinent to bring to the record that in AY 2007-08,
> 2008- 09 and 2009-10 the DRP has rejected the appellant's contentions and

> During the current year the appellant has maintained that it has maintained

8\. Against this order the assessee is in appeal before us.
9\. We have heard both the counsel and perused the records. Learned Counsel
submitted that identical transfer pricing adjustment was also done in earlier
years. He submitted that the matter has travelled to the ITAT in ITA No. 535,
& 7595/Mum/2012, 1320/Mum/2014 & 1797/Mum/2015 vide common order dated
30.1.2019 and the ITAT had deleted the transfer pricing adjustment.
10\. Per contra, learned Departmental Representative did not dispute the above
proposition.
12\. Upon careful consideration, we find that the identical issue was
considered by the ITAT in assessee's own case in earlier year referred above.
The conclusion of the Tribunal is gainfully referred as under :-
> 14\. We have heard the rival submissions. At the outset, we find that the
> assessee pursuant to the Service Centre Agreement had shared the cost
> towards Central Services Charges in respect of sales and marketing expenses;
> accounting; finance and MIS support services; training and product support
> services; and personnel support services. The assessee being participant to
> the Service Centre Agreement entered into by Abbott GmbH with various Abbott
> affiliates had to absorb certain costs that were allocated by the group to
> various participants including the assessee- company. In other words,
> certain services as detailed in the Service Centre Agreement, which are
> already reproduced hereinabove, were to be rendered at Abbott GmbH Germany
> and the cost incurred thereon would have to be shared by all the participant
> countries including the assessee-company in the ratio of turnover. These
> services are in the nature of shared services and are therefore customized
> for the Abbott group. We find that Abbott GmbH allocated the portion of the
> budgeted expenses on quarterly basis, based on  7 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l
> th c a r e P v t. L td .
sales to each AEs to whom the Central Services were rendered. At the end of
the year, the actual amount was determined based on which the final allocation
for the year got crystallized. The total cost of services rendered by Abbott
GmbH in the sum was 33135000 Euros and the assessee's share out of that were
239000 Euros comprising of costs incurred towards strategic sales and
marketing support services; training and product support services; accounting
and finance and MIS support services and personnel support services. We find
that the assessee had explained the nature of these individual services as
under:-
> "3.2.1. Strategic Sales and Marketing support Abbott GmbH invites Marketing
> Manager for upgrading their selling skills. This meetings are generally
> forums used to interact with Germany and other 'countries Marketing Manager
> and share their experience of selling which can be replicated in India.
> This becomes more important when AHPL is launching new products. 'The
> benefits of products as well as positioning are shared with the Marketing
> managers. These acquired skills are used in India for the benefit of
> existing customer or potential customer.
> 3.2.2. Training and Product Support services : In this case, service
> engineers are invited for training during the launch of new instruments as
> well as for upgradation of existing skills. The service engineer is being
> familiarized with the product in technical' terms like how the Instruments
> 'function, how is the preventive maintenance done, how the instruments is
> installed at customer location, what are the precautions taken for
> installation etc. and other finer points of the instruments are explained in
> details. This training is of immense help when the instrument is launched in
> India.
> 3.2.3. Accounting Finance and MIS support services: ITS (Instrument tracking
> system), SEAS (Service Equipment Accounting System), DFAIFLEX are few
> package installed in AHPL. which are being maintained by Abbott GmbH,
> Germany. ITS system is used to track Instrument location in India whereas
> SEAS is used to calculate service equipment amortization and DFAIFLEX is
> used to generate reports by PGN for analysis, control and If necessary take
> corrective action. It is also a planning tool used to forecast and is also
> used for MIS. India also uses ADOC (order entry) and FMS (margin tracking)
> systems.
> 3.2.4. Personnel Support Services:
> HR functioning in Germany comes up with Incentive scheme for sales manager
> and then they also approve the same."
15\. The ld.TPO determined the arm's length price of sales and marketing
support services to the tune of 133000 Euros equivalent to Rs.79,04,690 at Rs.
Nil and made adjustment to the same in transfer pricing order u/s 92CA(2) of
the Act. We find that the assessee had justified the same in the following
manner:-
8
> M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
> (a) The assessee gets characterized as a normal risk distributor, which has
> been accepted by the ld.TPO in his order.
> (b) From the risk profile of the assessee, which is not disputed, inventory
> risk lies with the assessee.
> (c) Since the assessee is bound to sell the imported products from AE in the
> local market in India, the entire distribution risks also vests with the
> assessee.
> (d) The expenditure that has been absorbed by the assessee by way of
> reimbursement to AE, based on gross cost allocation on shared services, were
> incurred in order to maintain the common methodology, manner of presentation
> of financial statements, common accounting policies and procedures in
> respect of various transactions of the group, which would enable smooth
> consolidation of financial statements at global level; MIS reporting system,
> common incentive schemes to all the employees of the group in the respective
> carter, proper training given to the respective employees of the respective
> participants for marketing the products of the assessee.
16\. In view of the above, we hold that the assessee obviously had to incur
certain advertisement and marketing expenses for distribution of its products.
In any case, we also hold that the ld.TPO cannot look into the propriety of
incurrence of expenses by the assessee. The role of ld.TPO is to see whether
all transactions carried out by the assessee with its AEs fall within the
ambit and meaning of international transaction u/s 92B of the Act and that
whether the same was transacted at arm's length price, for which purpose the
determination of price should be made in accordance with any of the methods
prescribed in the statute u/s 92C of the Act. From the Transfer Pricing Study
Report, the functions performed by supplying AEs and functions performed by
the assessee are enumerated in detail. One such functions performed by the AE
to all the participants companies including the assessee-company was marketing
support services, which admittedly include new product pre-marketing
activities and training given to the product management team by Abbott Group
at global level. The training is imparted on the latest techniques and
practices in marketing, the focus and emphasis is on delivering quality
products to customers and regular services to them in terms of medical,
product literature. Apart from this, marketing support services rendered by
AEs also includes scientific promotion of the products through participation
in medical meetings, both in India and abroad. Obviously, the AEs at global
level had to incur expenses for rendering these services, which are meant for
all participating countries across the globe. Hence, those costs ought to be
shared by all the participating companies. It is not disputed that the total
cost incurred by the group and the cost allocation made to assessee-company
under each head was duly certified by an independent Accountant, who was
appointed for this specific purpose in accordance with the conditions laid out
in the Service Centre Agreement. When such costs that had been allocated to
the assessee- company had been absorbed by making the payment to AEs for the
services rendered by AEs (which is not disputed by the Revenue before us),
then the  9 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
action of the lower authorities in determining the arm's length price of such
services at Rs.Nil is unwarranted.
17\. We also find from one of the functions performed by the assessee- company
is towards "Market Research and Strategic Marketing". Under this category, the
assessee carries out marketing functions in respect of the product imported
from its AEs. Apart from carrying out market study and analysis, the assessee
carries out competitor analysis, ascertains price data of similar products,
market trends etc. In addition, the assessee's field force of marketing
representatives pay field visits to Doctors and participate in medical
conferences. As regards imports of reagents and diagnostic equipments, the
assessee leverages on the promotional, scientific and technical material
developed by Abbott Germany. Additionally, Abbott Germany provides the
assessee, service engineers with scientific and technical product training and
other necessary support to enable the assessee's employees market the same
effectively in India.
18\. Apart from rendering strategic marketing functions, the assessee also
carries out warehousing and inventory management functions and distribution
functions in India. Hence, the assessee carries significant risks as a
distributor in this normal course of distribution process. We find from the
risk profile of the assessee that the assessee is exposed to significant
market risks and loss, if any, on account of lower/no demand for product due
to the change in the market structure and customer needs would have to be
borne by the assessee. This risk is reduced substantially because of the
presence of dynamic research programme of Abbott Germany, which provides the
assessee with a large suite of new products to choose and introduce in India,
in line with customer requirements. The assessee also has to maintain
sufficient inventory of traded goods so that the sales are not reduced for
want of stock. Hence, significant inventory risks coupled with the carrying
cost of interest also lies with the assessee. This is mitigated by timely
supply of quality goods by the assessee to the AEs so that the assessee does
not get into the situation of stock out. The entire group risk arising as a
result of sales to Indian customers is borne by the assessee. Hence, the
assessee had to mandatorily leverage and mitigate those risks by providing
quality products and following consistent practice at par with the global
practices for which the shared costs were reimbursed to AEs.
12\. Thereafter the Tribunal referred to the decision of the ITAT in the case
of Firmenich Aromatics India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT (ITA no. 2590/Mum/2017 for
A.Y. 2012-13 vide order dated 23.4.2018) and the ITAT order in the case of
Dresser Rand India Pvt. Ltd. (53 SOT 173). The Tribunal further concluded as
under :-
> 21\. In view of the above, we hold that the lower authorities were not
> justified in determining the arm's length price in respect of marketing
> expenses at Rs. Nil as against the claim of Rs.79,04,690.
10
> M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
22\. With regard to the remaining expenses like -
    (i)   Personnel Expenses            8,000 Euros
    (ii) Training Expenses             48,000 Euros
    (iii) Account and Miscellaneous    51,000 Euros.
The ld.TPO had made adhoc disallowance of 25% and held that 75% of the said
expenditure were at arm's length price. We hold that there is no basis for the
ld.TPO to arrive at this conclusion when the entire cost allocation sheet duly
certified by an independent Accountant was very much placed before him for his
examination. In any case, the ld.TPO cannot make any adhoc disallowance while
determining the ALP of international transaction. His duty is to determine the
ALP by following any of the five methods prescribed in section 92C of the Act
r.w.s. 10B of the I.T. Rules. In this regard, we find that the Hon'ble
jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT v. Johnson & Johnson reported in
ITA No.1030 of 2014 dated 07.03.2017 had held as under:-
> "(d) We find that the impugned order of the Tribunal upholding the order of
> the CIT(A) in the present facts cannot be found fault with. The TPO is
> mandated by law to determine the ALP by following one of the methods
> prescribed in Section 92C of the Act read with Rule 10B of the Income Tax
> Rules. However, the aforesaid exercise of determining the ALP in respect of
> the royalty payable for technical knowhow has not been carried out as
> required under the Act. Further, as held by the CIT(A) and upheld by the
> impugned order of the Tribunal, the TPO has given no reasons justifying the
> technical knowhow royalty paid by the Assessing Officer to its Associated
> Enterprises being restricted to 1% instead of 2%, as claimed by the
> respondent assessee. This determination of ALP of technical knowhow royalty
> by the TPO was ad- hoc and arbitrary as held by the CIT(A) and the Tribunal.
> (e) In the above view, the question as proposed does not give rise to any
> substantial question of law. Thus, not entertained."
23\. In view of the aforesaid factual observations in the light of evidences
available on record and respectfully following the decision of the Hon'ble
jurisdictional High Court in the case of Johnson & Johnson (supra), we hold
that the action of the Revenue in accepting only 75% of the expenses to be at
arm's length is not correct. Accordingly, we direct the ld.TPO to consider the
entire 1,07,000 Euro (8,000 + 48,000 + 51,000) in respect of three expenses as
stated supra, as the expenditure incurred for the purpose of business of the
assessee and which is determined to be at arm's length and accordingly no
adjustment in that regard is called for.
24\. We also find that this issue is common in other appeals also for
assessment years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 with the
following minor variance, which are tabulated herein below:-

                2010-2011         ALP was determined at Rs. 25 lakhs on adhoc basis

> other assessment years also, which are in appeal before us. Accordingly, the
> grounds raised by the assessee with regard to Transfer Pricing Adjustment in

> years.
13\. We find that since in assessee's own case for earlier years identical
transfer pricing adjustment has been deleted by the ITAT. It is not the case
that the facts in the present year are different. It is also not the case that
Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court has reversed the decision of the ITAT.
Hence, following the precedent as above, we set aside the orders of the
authorities below and decide the issue in favour of the assessee.
14\. In the result, assessee's appeal is allowed.
Revenue's appeal :
Apropos issue of depreciation of non-compete fees.
15\. The Assessing Officer in this case it is noted that the assessee has
claimed depreciation @ 25% of non-compete fees of Rs. 5,13,54,60,000/- paid as
part of slump sale agreement. On enquiry in this regard, the assessee
responded as under :-
> i. A non-compete is a negative right restraining another person from
> competing. As a part of contractual obligations, if a buyer secures such a
> right it is clear that he has in fact secured an invaluable right.
> ii. Non-compete right is a "business or commercial right". The fee is in
> lieu of which the assessee has secured right to carry on business without
> any competition from Piramal (post-acquisition for 8 years), iii. Such
> business right is of "similar nature" to know-how, patents, copyrights,
> trademarks, licences and franchises, iv. Reliance is placed on  12 M / s .

16\. However, the Assessing Officer was not convinced. He held that Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp Business System vs. CIT (ITA No.
492/2012) held that the non-compete fees paid by the taxpayer would not be
allowed as revenue expenditure since the benefit accrued was in capital field
for a substantial period of time. Further, the non-compete fees are not
eligible for depreciation under section 32(1)(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
because only intangible rights enforceable against the world at large would
qualify for depreciation. In view of the above, the assessee is not entitled
to claim depreciation on non-compete fees paid. Accordingly, the depreciation
of Rs. 128,38,65,000/- on non-compete fees is hereby disallowed.
17\. Upon assessee's appeal learned CIT(A) reproduced the assessee's
submission. Thereafter learned CIT(A) noted the following submission of the
assessee and made the same ground for allowing assessee's appeal by observing
as under :-
> "During the course of appellate proceedings the appellant submitted that it
> had entered into a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) dated May 21, 2010 with
> Piramal Healthcare Ltd (Piramal) in order to acquire Piramal's Base Domestic
> Formulations business on a slump sale basis. It was further  13 M / s . Ab b
> o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
submitted that in this case the seller i.e. Piramal has agreed not to engage
in competing activities for a period of eight years in India or other emerging
markets, to ensure that the Appellant can operate the acquired business
smoothly, without the threat of any direct or indirect competitions from the
seller. The appellant further contended that section 32(1)(ii) specifically
mentions certain types of intangible assets( namely Knowhow, patents,
copyrights, trademarks, license and franchises) it also has a residuary clause
covering " any other business or commercial rights of similar nature" so
according to appellant ron compete fees falls under the residuary clause
Reliance was placed on following case laws
1\. CIT vs. Ingersoll Rand International India Ltd (2014) 227 Taxman 176
(Karnataka High Court)
2\. Pentasoft Technologies Ltd. Vs DCIT (2014)222 Taxman 209 (Madras High
Court).
The appellant submitted that without prejudice if you are not in agreement
with the Appellant's contention that in alternative payments made towards non
compete fees may be treated a revenue expenses laid out for purpose of the
business, and allowable in the year in which the expenses was incurred (F.Y.
2010-11). It further submitted that expenses may be allowed proportionality as
deferred revenue expenses allowable over a period of eight years. From the
above analysis it is seen that the appellant's expenditure or non compete fees
can be claimed as deduction u/s 37(1) of the IT Act.
There are many judgements which do not consider non compete Tees as capital
expenditure. Relying on the following case laws I am of the considered opinion
that the appellant can be given deduction u/s 37(1) as deferred revenue
expenditure allowable for a period of eight years( the relevant period of non
compete).
Reliance is placed on following case laws - Decision of Hon'ble Mumbai
Tribunal in Premier Optical (P) Ltd vs ACIT (2008) 120 Taxman 167
(Mumbai)(MAG) wherein Hon'ble Tribunal held that non compete fees incurred for
restraining the recipients for a short or limited period to increase
profitability of the assessee is not a capital expenditure. The Tribunal
further held that since the expenditure was incurred for five years, the same
should be allowed over a period of five years. The decision has been followed
in a Hidelberg Cement India Ltd vs ACIT (2014) 31 ITR(T)582( Mumbai Tribunal).
Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd vs ACIT (2011) 7 ITR (T) 601 (Chennai).
The Tribunal relied on the principles laid down in the decision of the Apex
Court i in Madras Industrial Investment Corporate Ltd vs ACIT (1997) 225 ITR
802 (SC) in the context of allowance of deferred revenue expenditure being
discount on debentures, the Hon'ble Tribunal held that the non compete fee
paid securing an advantage over a period of years should be allowed as
deferred revenue expenditure over a period of agreement.
14
M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
Hence relying on the above discussions I direct the AO to treat the non
compete fees as deferred revenue expenditure for a period of eight years.
The ground of appeal is Allowed."
18\. Against the above order the Revenue is in appeal before us.
19\. Against this order revenue is in appeal before us. We have heard both the
Counsel and perused the records. We find that the issue in dispute is the
depreciation/amortisation of the non-compete fee paid. The assessing officer
has relied upon honourable Delhi High Court decision in the case of Sharp
business system (supra) and disallowed the claim of the depreciation on the
ground that the non-compete fee paid was in capital field.
20\. As against the above we note that learned CIT(A)has relied upon case laws
from honourable Karnataka High Court and honourable Madras High Court as under
:-
1\. CIT vs Ingersoll rand international ( 227 Taxmann176) Karnataka HC
2\. Pentasoft technologies vs DCIT (222 Taxman 209) Madras HC
21\. In these case laws depreciation/amortisation of the non-compete fee was
held to be allowable on the ground that as held by honourable Madras High
Court it strengthens the transfer of IPR and as held by honourable Karnataka
High Court it fell into the realm of definition under section 32. No decision
from honourable jurisdictional High Court has been cited before us. In this
view of the matter honourable Apex Court decision in the case of Vegetable
Products Ltd. (88 ITR 192) has to be followed. In the said case law honourable
court had expounded that if two constructions are possible the one in favour
of assessee should be adopted. Since the decision of the learned CIT(A) is in
accordance with the ratio arising from the decision of honourable Karnataka
High Court and honourable Madras High Court as above we do not find any
infirmity in the same in absence of any direct jurisdictional High Court
decision on the subject. Hence we uphold the order of ld CIT(A) on this issue
15 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
Apropos issue of applicability of provision of section 43A :
22\. On this issue the Assessing Officer observed that during the assessment
year under consideration, foreign exchange gain of Rs. 308,16,00,000/- on
restatement of purchase consideration payable by assessee to Piramal is
credited to the profit and loss account in compliance with the Accounting
Standard 11 - The effects of change in foreign exchange rate' - which provides
for accounting for a foreign currency transaction denominated in foreign
currency. The assessee has bifurcated the foreign exchange gain Rs.
308,16,00,000/- into (a) gain on capital account Rs. 306,55,23,898/- (Fixed
assets & intangible assets, goodwill) and (b) gain on current account Rs.
1,60,76,102/- (i.e., inventory, accounts receivable and loans and advances).
The assessee has offered Rs. 1,60,76,102/- as revenue receipt and offered for
taxation. However, amount of Rs. 306,55,23,898/- has been treated as capital
receipt not chargeable to tax. The Assessing Officer asked the assessee to
justify why the same is not a revenue receipt and alternatively the same
should not be reduced from the capital cost of asset concerned. The assessee's
response was noted by the Assessing Officer as under :-
> "In response, the assessee vide letter dated 14.01.2015 submitted that
> whether a gain accruing to an assessee is a revenue receipt or a capital
> receipt depends upon whether the gain is in respect of a trading asset or a
> capital asset. The amount in foreign currency is utilized or intended to be
> utilized in the course or for a trading purpose!, any gain or loss arising
> from fluctuation in its value on account of alteration in the rate of
> exchange would be a trading gain or loss. However, where the underlying is
> of capital nature, the gain or loss arising from the foreign currency
> fluctuation will be a capital receipt or loss. Accordingly, the notional
> gain on reinstatement of the liability to the extent Rs. 306,55,23,898/- is
> capital in nature, is not taxable.
> With regard to why the foreign exchange gain on re-instatement of 'deferred
> purchase consideration payable' should not be reduced from capital cost of
> asset is concerned, the assessee stated that adjustment vis-a-vis foreign
> exchange gain/(loss) is governed by the provisions of section 43A. For
> section 43A to be applicable the assessee should acquire the asset from a
> country outside India. This essential condition is not met in this case as
> the acquisition of 'base domestic formulation business' by slump sale, is a
> domestic transaction involving acquisition of assets in India. Therefore
> provisions of section 43A will not be applicable."
16 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
23\. However, the Assessing Officer was not satisfied. He referred to the
provisions of section 43A. He noted that the assessee has acquired base
domestic formulation business. He referred to the business transfer agreement
entered following some important definition as under :-
> "Business" means the business of researching, developing, formulating,
> manufacturing, selling, marketing, distributing, importing or exporting
> generic pharmaceuticals products in finished form (including the Products
> and the R&D Products) and related services of the base: domestic formulation
> and mass market branded formulation (Truecare™) businesses of Seller and PHL

> such businesses are conducted in India and any Emerging Market by Seller and
> PHL Pharma Private Limited immediately prior to the date of this Agreement

> "Patents" means all national, regional and international patents, patent

> distribution,  17 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
> importation or exportation of the products of the Business in India, Sri
> Lanka and Nepal.
24\. Thereafter the Assessing Officer referred to certain portion of the
agreement as under :-
> Article 2 deals with Agreement to Sell and Purchase in which Section 2.1
> defines the term "Transferred Assets". As per clause (d) to the same it is
> stated:
> (d) the Contracts, Registrations, Intellectual Property rights and all other

> Clause (c) to Section 2.5 further states with regard to Intellectual
> Property:
> (c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its

> engaged in the business of conducting any Purchaser Competing Activities in
> India and/or any Emerging Market; ..."
25\. Referring to the above the Assessing Officer held as under :-
> "8.5. From the reading of above definitions and sections, it can be said
> that the capital assets acquired by the assessee relates to business in
> India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Emerging Markets. The Goodwill acquired by the
> assessee is clearly not an India specific right but it is from country

> India. The Intellectual Property rights are defined as worldwide
> rights/title/interest. The non-compete relates to India and Emerging
> Markets. There are many other clauses which reinforce the argument.
> As per the provisions of section 43 A, if any payment is made towards the
> whole or a part of the cost of the asset, then the increase/decrease in
> foreign exchange, the same has to be reduced from the cost of the asset. The
> provisions of the section applies to the assessee. The copyrights,
> trademarks, intellectual property, non-compete fees, etc. are the capital
> assets which are acquired from a country outside India.
> 8.6. In view of above, the amount of Rs. 306,55,23,898/- is reduced from the
> cost of the asset on which 25% depreciation has been claimed. Therefore, the
> effective claim of depreciation reduces by Rs. 76,63,80,975/- and the same
> is added to the total income of the assessee."
26\. Against the above order the assessee is in appeal before learned CIT(A).
Learned CIT(A) reproduced the submission of the assessee. Thereafter referring
to certain portion of the assessee's submission and held that ground of appeal
is allowed. Learned CIT(A) held as under :-
> "During the course of assessment proceedings the AO noticed that assessee
> has bifurcated the foreign exchange gain of Rs. 308, 16,00,0007- into (a)
> gain on capital Amount of Rs 306,55,23,898/- [Fixed assets and intangible
> assets, goodwill] and (b) gain on current account of Rs. 1,60,76,102/- (i.e.
> inventory, accounts recoverable and losses and advances).
19
> M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
> The appellant during the course of assessment proceedings stated that
> whether a gain accruing to an assessee is a revenue receipt or a capital

> Hence in the light of above discussions the ground of appeal is allowed.
> However the AO is directed to verify whether the asset is a trading asset or
> a capital asset."
27\. Against the above order Revenue is in appeal before us. We have heard
both the counsel and perused the records. We find that as per section 43A
relevant provision read as under :-
> "43A. Special provisions consequential to changes in rate of exchange of

> Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, where

28\. From the above we note that the above provision is special provision
consequential to change in rate of exchange of currency. Learned CIT(A) has
only referred to aspect that under section 43A its applicability depend upon
the satisfaction of the criteria that the asset was acquired by the assessee
from a country outside India. Hence, learned CIT(A) held that since this
criteria is not fulfilled as person from whom business is acquired is also an
Indian company hence, he has held that section 43A is not at all applicable.
In this regard we note that learned CIT(A) in his adjudication has not
considered the finding of the Assessing Officer that the asset involved in
slump sale included areas of Nepal, Sri Lanka and other. In this view of the
matter learned CIT(A)'s finding is not at all sustainable. Since learned
CIT(A) has not considered all aspect of the reasoning given by the Assessing
Officer  21 M / s . Ab b o t t H e a l th c a r e P v t. L td .
for making the addition, we deem it appropriate to remit this issue to the
file of learned CIT(A) to consider them afresh and pass a speaking order on
this issue. Needless to add the assessee should be granted adequate
opportunity of being heard.
29\. Before parting we may add that the assessee in its submission has
referred to the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CUB Pty
Ltd. Vs. UOI vide order dated 25.7.2016. Learned CIT(A) in his adjudication
has neither referred to this decision nor dealt with the aspect of Assessing
Officer's order that the asset acquired included a reference to Sri Lanka and
Nepal. However, in this regard, we note that the said decision of Hon'ble
Delhi High Court was with respect to section 9(1)(i) of the Act. It was not
rendered in connection with section 43A of the Act. It is settled law that
decision has to be considered in terms of context in which it is rendered.
30\. In the result, this appeal by the Revenue is partly allowed.
Order has been pronounced in the Court on 06.1.2020.
