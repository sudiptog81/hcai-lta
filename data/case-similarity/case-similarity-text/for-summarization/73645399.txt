Commissioner (A.R.) For Respondent CORAM:
Shri S.S. Kang, Vice President Shri Sahab Singh, Member (Technical) Date of
Hearing : 19.01.2012 Date Pronounced : 19.01.2012 ORDER NO.
Per : S.S. Kang Heard both sides.
2\. Common issue is involved in both these applications; therefore they are
being taken up together.
3\. The applicant filed these applications for waiver of total demand of duty,
interest and penalties.
4\. The demand is confirmed after denying credit on the ground that the
appellant was availing benefit of exemption on inputs used in the production
of LPG which also goes into the manufacture of Nitrogen and some parts of
Nitrogen is used for degassing of wagons. The case of the Revenue is that as
the appellant availed credit of duty paid on common inputs, therefore the
appellant is liable to pay 10% of the price of the Nitrogen which goes into
the process of degassing of wagons. Part of the demand is confirmed on the
ground that the power generated in the captive power plant is used outside the
factory of production i.e. in residential colony and the appellant is liable
to pay 10% of the price of the electricity which is going outside the factory.
The demand is also confirmed in respect of the electricity which is used for
peripheral activities within the factory on the ground that the same is not
used in or in relation to the manufacture of final product.
5\. The contention of the appellant is that as the common inputs are used in
the manufacture of LPG which cleared nil rate of duty and the Nitrogen which
was captively consumed within the factory in relation to the manufacture of
LPG which is exempt from duty, therefore the demand in respect of Nitrogen
which is used for degassing of wagons is not sustainable. The appellant relied
upon the earlier decision in the appellants own case in Service Tax Appeal
No. 131 of 2007 dated 28.08.2008 reported as 2009(16) STJ 99 (CESTAT-
Ahmedabad) whereby the Tribunal has held that as the appellants are clearing
the final exempted product as per provision of Rule 6(3)(a) of CENVAT Credit
Rules, question of reversal of credit of duty paid on the inputs used in the
manufacture of fuel does not arise, therefore input service credit availed in
respect of Nitrogen which is also input for the manufacture of LPG which is
used for degassing of wagons, is not sustainable.
5.1 In respect of electricity which is manufactured and used in the peripheral
area and used outside the factory, the contention of the applicant is that
since the electricity is not an exempted final product, therefore the demand
of 10% on the value of electricity going outside the factory is not
sustainable. In respect of inputs used in the generation of electricity which
is going outside the factory, the appellant relied upon the decision of the
Honble Supreme Court in the case of Collector of Central Excise vs. Solaris
Chemtech Ltd.  2007 (214) ELT 481 (S.C.) and in the case of Maruti Suzuki
Ltd.  2009 (240) ELT 641.
5.2 It is also submitted by the appellant that the unit is a 100% EOU and the
inputs used by the appellant in relation to the generation of electricity had
been procured without payment of duty. In the circumstances, where the
appellant used duty free inputs for generation of electricity used outside
factory and where the appellant has not taken any credit on inputs used in
relation to the generation of electricity, demand of duty by taking into the
consideration 10% of the price of the electricity going outside the factory,
is not sustainable.
5.3 In respect of the electricity used in the peripheral area in the factory,
the contention is that, in the show-cause notice the allegation is that the
demand is in respect of electricity consumed for peripheral activities within
the factory. However, the adjudicating authority in the impugned order held
that the appellant has failed to show that the electricity is used within the
factory of production, in the absence of evidence the demand is confirmed. The
contention is that the show-cause notice itself is admitted that the
electricity was used for the peripheral activities within the factory
therefore the impugned order is not sustainable on this issue also.
6\. The Revenue reiterated the findings of the lower authority and held that
as the Nitrogen is used for degassing of wagons and no duty is paid on such
quantities, therefore the demand is rightly made. In respect of the
electricity which is generated in the captive power plant and used outside the
factory, the Revenue relied upon the findings in the impugned order.
7\. We find that as the appellant is reversing credit in respect of inputs
used in or in relation to the manufacture of LPG and in respect of Nitrogen
which is used for degassing of wagons. We find that the appellant has cited
the above decision in appellants own case before the adjudicating authority
and the adjudicating authority has also taken note of that, however, no
finding has been given in this regard.
8\. In respect of electricity used outside the factory of production as well
as in respect of peripheral area in the factory, we find that the Revenue has
confirmed the demand on the ground that the appellant is liable to pay 10% on
the price of electricity which is used outside the factory. We find that this
issue is now settled by the decision of Honble Supreme Court in the case of
Solaris Chemtech Ltd. (supra) and of Maruti Suzuki Ltd. (supra) relied upon by
the applicant wherein the Honble Supreme Court held that electricity is not
an excisable item as per Section 3 of CEA, 1944 and the manufacturer is liable
to reverse the credit on duty availed as inputs used in the generation of
electricity which is not used in the factory of the production.
9\. In respect of demand on the electricity which is used for peripheral area
in the factory, we find that the adjudicating authority held that the
appellant has failed to show that the same is used within the factory,
therefore this issue also requires reconsideration as in the show-cause notice
the allegation is that the electricity is used in the peripheral area within
factory gate.
10\. In view of the above, we find the matter requires reconsideration by the
adjudicating authority afresh.
11\. The impugned orders are set aside after waiving the pre-deposit of duty,
interest and penalty in respect of both appeals and the matter is remanded to
the Commissioner of Central Excise to decide afresh after affording an
opportunity of hearing to the appellant. The appeals are disposed of by way of
remand.
