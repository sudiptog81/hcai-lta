granted and rightly the authority has also not registered the marriage. They
have only stated that the parties alone are entitled to directly approach the
appropriate competent authority and if the marriage is properly proved, the
authority will register the marriage in accordance with law. However, it is
made clear that the association as such cannot conduct or perform any marriage
or create records to show that they have solemnised marriage without following
the Rules of law. Therefore, when a valid marriage has not been conducted, a
document authorising such marriage cannot be presented before the registering
authority for registration. In such view of th matter, this Writ Petition is
dismissed. No costs. 09.11.2016 Index : Yes / No;

    O R D E R
This Writ Petition has been filed seeking for a Writ of Mandamus directing the
respondents to consider the representation of the petitioner dated 25.10.2016
and receive all the application for marriage submitted through petitioner's
Association and register it and issue marriage certificate to them under the
provisions of the Tamilnadu Registration of Marriage Act, 2009 or under the
provisions of Hindu Marriage Act, whichever is applicable.
2\. According to the petitioner, it is registered under the Tamilnadu
Societies Registration Act, 1975 in Sl.No.131/2013 and they are conducting
marriage for poor people irrespective of their caste, creed and religion after
verifying their credentials and fulfillment of other eligibility criteria
prescribed by the Act and issue certificate that the marriage has been
solemnized before them. The grievance of the petitioner is that when they
submit application with all particulars on behalf of the applicants seeking
issuance of marriage certificate, 3rd respondent / Joint Sub-Registrar II,
Cuddalore has refused to receive the same and hence the petitioner has come
forward with this Writ Petition.
3\. The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the petitioner-
Association conducted marriage after verifying necessary credentials and
issued certificate that the marriage was solemnized before them. Therefore, it
is the duty of the 3rd respondent to receive the application and register it
and they cannot summarily refuse to receive the application. He would also
point out that when the marriage registration is compulsory and the said
marriage is solemnized by the association, after verifying all the necessary
details, the 3rd respondent should register the same, but without doing so the
3rd respondent has refused to receive the application submitted by the
petitioner.
4\. The learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents
brought to the notice of this Court that the validity of the registration of
the petitioner's association has already expired. Thereafter, renewal has been
sought for and the petitioner-association has not been renewed. Therefore, as
on date, it is not a valid association. He would further contend that the
association by itself has no legal right to conduct any marriage and even if
intercaste marriage is conducted, it is for them to approach concerned
authority for due registration under the Act. The association, on behalf of
persons, cannot submit applications to the competent authority to register the
marriage. It is also not known under what authority the association has
conducted marriage? Earlier, this Court has categorically stated that the
marriage conducted in the office of the Advocate or in other places are not
legally valid marriage. Merely because it is an association and that too a
non-valid association as on date, they cannot conduct marriage and seek the
authority to register the same. He would further contend that the 3rd
respondent has not rejected the application, but only stated that the
concerned applicants/persons should approach the appropriate authority for
registration and the association cannot approach the authority for
registration.
5\. Heard the learned counsel on either side and perused the materials
available on record.
6\. As rightly pointed out by the learned Special Government Pleader appearing
for the respondents merely because the petitioner form an association under
the name and style of Tamilnadu Inter Caste Married & Social Welfare
Association that does not have any legal right to solemnize the marriage. A
particular person, who want to get married is entitled to marry according to
his/her wish and if the marriages are solemnized in the temple or in a
marriage hall, it is always open to those persons to get married by
approaching Register office and get it registered in accordance with law.
7\. Besides the above, this Court recalls and recollects the Judgment of the
Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in H.C.P.No.2767 of 2013 dated 17.10.2014
wherein it is clearly explained the meaning of the expression "solemnised by
following the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhaurao vs. State of
Maharashtra [AIR 1965 SC 1564] and that the relevant portion is extracted
hereunder:-
20. At this juncture, we would like to refer to the meaning of the expression
"solemnised" that is used both in Section 7 and in Section 7A of the Hindu
Marriage Act as expounded by the Supreme Court in Bhaurao vs. State of
Maharashtra [AIR 1965 SC 1564].
"The word 'solemnize' means, in connection with a marriage, 'to celebrate the
marriage with proper ceremonies and in due form'. It follows, therefore, that
unless the marriage is 'celebrated or performed with proper ceremonies and due
form' it cannot be said to be 'solemnized'."
7\. Admittedly, even if it is an association the same is not empowered or
entitled to register or solemnize marriage.
8\. Under those circumstances, the prayer in the Writ Petition cannot be
granted and rightly the authority has also not registered the marriage. They
have only stated that the parties alone are entitled to directly approach the
appropriate competent authority and if the marriage is properly proved, the
authority will register the marriage in accordance with law. However, it is
made clear that the association as such cannot conduct or perform any marriage
or create records to show that they have solemnised marriage without following
the Rules of law. Therefore, when a valid marriage has not been conducted, a
document authorising such marriage cannot be presented before the registering
authority for registration. In such view of th matter, this Writ Petition is
dismissed. No costs. 09.11.2016 Index : Yes / No;
