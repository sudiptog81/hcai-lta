(1) This order shall dispose of two Civil Writ Petitions No.5213 & 5620 of
2015 as the issues raised by the petitioner-Company in both the cases are
interrelated or are incidental to the core issue regarding the scope and
extent of exemptions claimed to have been granted to it under the Industrial
Policy, 2003.
For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 1 of 43  ::: Downloaded on -
24-12-2016 13:21:25 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 -2- (2) In the first petition, the
petitioner-Company has laid challenge to the demand notice dated 13.12.2011
(P14), the show cause notice dated 29.09.2014 (P15) and the letter dated
10.03.2015 (P17) raising the demand for payment of External Development
Charges (EDC) and has further sought refund of `11,82,47,000/- paid by it in
lieu of EDC and cess thereon, besides refund of `7,09,23,000/- paid towards
licence fee. Both the reliefs have been sought on the premise that the
petitioner has been exempted from such levies under the Industrial Policy,
2003. In the second writ petition, there is a challenge to the letters dated
14.10.2013 (P11) and 15.11.2013 (P12) requiring the petitioner-Company to
obtain 'No Dues Certificate' from Greater Mohali Area Development Authority
(GMADA) upon payment of External Development Charges and licence fee as a pre-
condition for processing the Change of Land Use (CLU) despite exemption of
Change of Land Use charges as well as other levies under the Industrial
Policy, 2003. The petitioner has also assailed the letter dated 22.11.2012
(P13), asking it to obtain NDC from GMADA as a pre-condition for allowing
concessions under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995 (in
short, 'the PAPRA, 1995'). Similar challenge is laid to yet another letter
dated 28.08.2012 (P18) requiring the petitioner to obtain NDC from GMADA as a
pre-condition for approval of Layout and Zoning Plans submitted by it. A
further direction to grant extension of time towards completion of the project
on account of delays having been caused by the respondents, has also been
prayed for.
Facts of the case:
(3) The petitioner is a Private Limited Company duly incorporated on
25.11.2005 under the Companies Act, 1956. The main objectives of the For

> reduced regulations and general facilitation.
> â€¢ To rejuvenate and make competitive existing industry, particularly in the
> small scale sector through improved technology, product quality and
> marketing. â€¢ To create a special thrust in the areas where Punjab has an
> edge in terms of cost and competitiveness."
(5) Chapter-10 of the Industrial Policy, 2003 deals with Industrial
Infrastructure Development which envisaged to make a serious endeavour to
attract private investment and participation for creation of adequate
infrastructure and for upgradation of existing infrastructure. Paragraph 10.4
of the Policy has a direct bearing on the controversy and its different
clauses are to the following effect:-
> "10.4 Following measures will be taken to encourage private sector

2003 to grant it a special package of incentives for setting up of Information
Technology/Industrial Park in an area measuring 125 acres of land with an
investment of `952 crore at SAS Nagar Mohali. The Secretary, Industries and

13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 15 - which the outstanding dues were to the
tune of `1917.41 lacs, which was payable in nine equated biannual instalments
by 27.04.2016. (13) The petitioner is said to have made some more payments
towards External Development Charges and in this manner a sum of `965.25 lacs
remained outstanding as on 29.09.2014, due to non-payment whereof, show cause
notice dated 29.09.2014 (P15) was served on it. The petitioner replied to the
show-cause notice pointing out that as per the amicable settlement between the
parties, a sum of `200 lacs was paid by it so that GMADA could clear the
pending revised Layout Plan/Zoning Plans/Building Plans. The GMADA, however,
did not accede to the petitioner's request and served it with the impugned
memo dated 10.03.2015 (P17) informing that as per the Punjab Government
policy, it was decided to recover the due amount along with interest etc. as
per the revised schedule of payment mentioned therein, asking the petitioner
to clear the outstanding dues in instalments by 09.10.2016.
(14) While assailing the afore-mentioned demand orders, the petitioner's
precise case is that the payments made by it have been wrongly appropriated by
the respondents towards EDC as no such charges are leviable since the same
were actually exempt under the Industrial Policy, 2003\. The petitioner is
said to have been caught unaware by levying EDC and licence fee contrary to
the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 11.10.2006 (P4) executed
between the petitioner and the State. The petitioner thus seeks refund of the
payments made by it which are said to have been illegally appropriated towards
EDC, cess as well as licence fee. (15) The petitioner has further claimed
parity with M/s Janta Land Promoters, who was also granted exemptions under
the Industrial Policy, For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 15 of 43  :::

challenged the same before this Court in CWP No.11744 of 2008 (Janta Land

Estate and Housing Development Ltd. vs. State of Punjab & Ors.) which were
allowed by this Court on 26.11.2010. The petitioner also relies upon another
decision dated 09.09.2013 of this Court in CWP No.5536 of 2013 (M/s Chandigarh
Overseas Pvt.Ltd. vs. State of Punjab & Ors.), in which the previous decision
in M/s Janta Land Promoter's case was followed.
CWP No.5620 of 2015 (16) In continuation of the first petition, the second
writ petition has laid challenge to various communications asking the
petitioner-company to seek No Due Certificate from GMADA regarding payment of
EDC and licence fee etc. as a pre-condition for (i) processing the case of
Change of Land Use; (ii) allowing concessions under the Punjab Apartment and
Property Regulation Act, 1985 and (iii) granting approval to Lay Out and
Zoning Plans submitted by the petitioner-company. A further direction has been
sought to grant extension of time towards completion of project after granting
all requisite approvals, referred to above, as the delay has been caused for
want of these necessary approvals. The aforementioned reliefs have also been
sought on the principal premise that the petitioner-company has been exempted
from the levy of EDC and licence fee etc. under the Industrial Policy, 2003
hence it cannot be compelled to pay these charges as a pre-condition for grant
of CLU or for sanctioning of Lay Out and Zoning Plans. Rest of the facts are
identical to those averred in the first petition. THE RESPONDENTS' CASE For
Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 16 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016
13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 17 - (17) State of Punjab through the
Department of Industries and Commerce has filed a short affidavit-cum-reply,
admitting the fact that all the Mega Information Technology Parks Projects
including that of the petitioner-Company were approved by the Empowered
Committee in its meeting held on 29.03.2006 followed by the Agreement with the
State Government on 11.10.2006. It is interestingly averred that in view of
the amendment made in the Allocation of Business Rules on 16.03.2012, the
cases/files of all such Projects approved by the Empowered Committee stood
transferred to the Department of Information Technology vide letter dated
04.04.2013 and as such the detailed reply, if any, is to be filed by the
Department of Information and Technology.
(18) The Director-cum-Secretary, Department of Information Technology
(respondent No.4) has filed a separate reply dated 08.04.2015, which again
does not deal with any factual issue except pointing out that GMADA has raised
a demand towards EDC and licence fee and the petitioner in its reply dated
10.11.2014 sent to the Department of Information Technology "has not taken the
stand" that EDC or other fees having been exempted, are not payable by the
petitioner. The only other reference made is to a letter dated 27.05.2014
asking the petitioner to explain its position for non-payment of outstanding
dues. (19) Respondent No.3 - GMADA in its written statement has averred that
the special package of incentives granted on 05.05.2006 for setting up
Information Technology/Industrial Park in an area of 125 acres of land and
with an investment of `952 crores, was valid only for a period of three years
and the petitioner did not take any step to implement the project within the
stipulated period. Meanwhile, the Industrial Policy, 2003 came to For
Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 17 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016
13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 18 - an end on 06.10.2009 and it was
superseded by the Industrial Policy, 2009. The petitioner applied for
extension of period for the implementation of the Project for a period of one
year, which was granted. The Project was thus to be implemented by 28.03.2010
but the petitioner still took no steps to implement the Project except getting
a Layout Plan of only 45 acres approved on 30.09.2009. The petitioner also
deposited a sum of `168.75 lacs as part-instalment of EDC on 29.09.2009 and
further sought extension of two years which was also granted so as to complete
the Project by 28.03.2012.
(20) It is further averred that the petitioner neither made any efforts to
implement the Project within the extended period nor it appeared to have the
capacity to honour its commitment to invest `952 crores as its balance- sheet
for the year ending 31.03.2014 depicts a total investment of `154.58 crores on
the entire Project. The Project was to be set up in 125 acres whereas the
petitioner had not implemented even 10% of the Project. (21) GMADA has
referred to Clause-5(iv)(q) of the Agreement dated 11.10.2006, which according
to it, clearly specifies that EDC would have to be deposited by the
petitioner-Company as a proportionate cost of infrastructure development. The
petitioner understood this Clause correctly and started paying EDC w.e.f.
29.09.2009 and continued to make intermittent payments till 05.12.2014. When
the petitioner became a defaulter, it itself applied on 25.07.2014 and
27.11.2014 (R1 & R2) for re- scheduling the payment of EDC etc. The revised
schedule of payment was also not adhered to by the petitioner.
(22) In the meantime, the State Government having regard to the difficulties
being faced by the developer companies, took a fresh policy For Subsequent
orders see CWP-5620-2015 18 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 :::
CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 19 - decision dated 06.02.2015 (R3) to give yet another
opportunity to the developers to implement the Projects in public-interest.
The Policy contemplates re-scheduling the payment of outstanding dues provided
that 10% of the defaulted/due amount was paid. It was in terms of the afore-
stated policy that a revised demand notice dated 10.03.2015 (P17) was served
on the petitioner according to which an amount of `2.26 crores was required to
be deposited till 09.04.2015. The petitioner, instead of depositing the said
amount, challenged the said demand notice, may be to thwart the payment of
outstanding dues. It is also alleged that various complaints, oral and
written, have been received against the petitioner- company from the general
public/allottees for not honoring the commitments made to such allottees while
selling the plots.
(23) It has been reiterated that instead of investing `952 crores within a
period of three years or within the extended period till September, 2012, the
petitioner has admittedly invested only `154 crores till 31.03.2014 and is
thus guilty of violating the Agreement as well as the basic objective of the
Industrial Policy, 2003 which was aimed at providing cascading benefit to the
people of the State and not to an individual company who has taken the State
for a ride. By way of an additional affidavit, GMADA has also placed on record
copies of the Agreements entered into by the State of Punjab with (a) M/s
Janta Land Promoters (R6); (b) M/s Chandigarh Overseas Pvt.Ltd. (R7); and (c)
M/s Hansa Tubes Pvt. Ltd. (R8) for a comparative analysis of the terms and
conditions whereby the parties bound themselves down.
(24) GMADA has further averred that the petitioner cannot draw any mileage out
of the judgements of this Court in (i) M/s Janta Land For Subsequent orders
see CWP-5620-2015 19 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP

No.16689 of 2010 (M/s PVP Entertainment Ltd. vs. State of Punjab & Ors.)
squarely rejects the petitioner's claim.
(25) Petitioner has filed a composite Replication to all the written
statements, asserting that while respondent No.1 has suppressed the relevant
facts, respondent No.2 has chosen not to file any written statement. The
written statement filed on behalf of respondent No.4 has been objected to for
want of correct verification. The averments made by GMADA (respondent No.3) in
its written statement have been controverted. The later judgment of this Court
in Hansa Tube Pvt. Ltd. case (supra) has been distinguished on the strength of
Clause-5(iv) of the respective Agreements as also on the premise that the said
judgment has been rendered without taking notice of the decision of the Apex
Court in State of Bihar vs. Kalyanpur Cement Ltd. (2010) 3 SCC 274,
Clause-10.4.1 of the Industrial Policy, 2003 has again been reproduced to lay
emphasis on the fact that EDC for private industrial estate developers is one
component which has been expressly exempted in exercise of powers vested in
the State Government under Section 44(2) of the PAPRA, 1995.
(26) We have heard Sarvshri Rajiv Atma Ram and Anand Chhibber, Senior
Advocates on behalf of the petitioner(s) and Shri RS Khosla, Senior Advocate
for GMADA as well as Shri Rajesh Bhardwaj, Addl. AG, Punjab at a considerable
length and have gone through the relevant record with their assistance.

(28) Shri R.S. Khosla, learned senior counsel for GMADA and Shri Rajesh
Bhardwaj, learned Addl. AG Punjab strenuously opposed the petitioner's claim,
as according to them, the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed for the
reasons that:-
(i) Time is the Essence of the Contract and Clause-5(i) of the Agreement
provides in specific that "the Company shall make an investment of Rs.952
crore including fixed capital investment of at least Rs.1 crore at one
location,...by setting up of Information Technology Parks Projects in 125
acres of land at Mohali with an investment of Rs.952 crores within a period of
three years effective from 29.03.2006." Clause-6 of the Agreement
categorically states For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 26 of 43  :::
Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 27 - that "in
case the above Company fails to comply with the provisions of
para-5(i),....... within the stipulated period mentioned therein, the
concession enumerated in para-5(iv) above shall stand automatically withdrawn
and the Company shall have no claim or liability whatsoever on the State
Government in this regard". The petitioner has admittedly failed to complete
the project or make investment of Rs.952 crores by March, 2009 or within the
extended period till March, 2012. Not only this, the petitioner has rather
chosen not to avail the benefit of THE latest policy dated 06.02.2015
whereunder the payment of outstanding dues has been re-scheduled subject to
payment of 10% of the defaulted/due amount. As a result of repeated failure of
the petitioner to honour the agreed terms and conditions of the binding
contract, Clause-6 thereof became operative and all the concessions and
incentives which were agreed to be granted to the petitioner stood
automatically withdrawn;
(ii) the principle of 'promissory estoppel' applies against the petitioner and
not the respondents. The petitioner agreed with open eyes to share the
proportionate burden of the cost of 'infrastructure development' and deposited
the initial instalment without any murmuring. The petitioner subsequently took
a somersault to gain unlimited time as due to its depleted financial
condition, the petitioner is unable to pay the agreed costs;
(iii) all the components of 'External Development Charges' as defined in
Section 2(p) of PAPRA, 1995 are included in Clause-5(iii)(e) of the Agreement
(P4) which defines 'infrastructure development' For Subsequent orders see

No.5213 of 2015 - 28 - and is not an exhaustive clause. As the petitioner
agreed to pay the proportionate cost incurred towards infrastructure
development of the area where its project is located, the petitioner cannot
blow hot and cold and seek implementation of the Agreement but not the Clause
imposing above-stated liability on it;
(iv) the petitioner cannot take any advantage of the decisions of this Court
in Janta Land Promoter's case or Chandigarh Overseas Pvt.Ltd. case (supra) for
the reason that there was no clause in the Agreements entered into between
them and the State Government, obligating those developers to pay EDC or
proportionate cost of infrastructure development. On the other hand, such a
condition was expressly agreed to by the developer in the case of Hansa Tubes
Pvt.Ltd. (supra) as also by the petitioner vide Agreement dated 11.10.2006. In
fact, such a condition was conveyed to the petitioner, in no uncertain terms,
vide LOI dated 05.05.2006 also [Clause (xvii) of P3];
(v) the exemption from PAPRA, 1995 was conditional and as the petitioner
failed to perform the obligations agreed to by it, the exemption got
automatically withdrawn;
(vi) the petitioner was exempted from payment of licence fee in respect of the
area of the project to be developed for industrial purposes and that exemption
had never been withdrawn. There was no exemption from payment of licence fee
qua the commercial or residential components and the demand raised against the
petitioner pertains to the residential and commercial projects only; For

(vii) the petitioner itself is responsible for the delay in the commencement
of its project. Soon after the Agreement between the parties executed on
11.10.2006, the State Pollution Control Board granted no objection on
20.08.2007 (P5 colly) and CLU in respect of 104.08 acres was also granted on
26.09.2007. The Pollution Control Board vide letter dated 17.05.2011 has
pointed out that the petitioner did not apply for Environment Clearance and as
soon it was applied, the clearance was granted without wastage of time on
05.03.2013 (P9);
(viii) the petitioner in the first phase wanted to develop only 45 acres land
out of the project area measuring 125 acres. The petitioner deposited EDC etc.
for the first phase on 30.09.2009 and its layout plans for that area were
immediately approved. There has thus never ever been any delay on the part of
the authorities as alleged by the petitioner;
(ix) the petitioner has failed to disclose the contents and import of the
State Government notification dated 29.10.2009 (R13), issued in exercise of
powers under Section 44(2) of the PAPRA, 1995, whereby the Government of
Punjab exempted the petitioner's industrial project of 45 acres from the
provisions of the above- mentioned Act "except Section 32" subject to the
terms and conditions contained in the said notification including (a) the
promoter shall strictly abide by the Agreement dated 11.10.2006;
(b) the promoter shall deposit the entire amount towards Punjab Urban
Development Fund created under Section 32 of the Act within 30 days of the
sanctioning of layout plan; (c) the promoter For Subsequent orders see

Punjab Pollution Control Board; (d) the promoter shall obtain Environment
Clearance before the commencement of the project. The petitioner, however,
continued to delay compliance of most of the conditions contained in the
above-stated notification and is thus responsible for the automatic withdrawal
of the incentives and concessions.
Legislative Scheme of PAPRA, 1995 (29) The Statement of Objects and Reasons of
PAPRA, 1995 unveils that the problem of controlling the activities of private
colonizers engaged in the construction of apartments and sale of plots has
been engaging the attention of State Government as some of such colonizers
were operating solely with the motive of profits without any regard to the
interest and rights of the individual buyers. The State Government, therefore,
felt the need to formulate a law in order to check, control and regulate the
activities of private colonizers and protect the interest of consumers. The
Model Draft Bill circulated by Government of India on the same subject
elucidated necessary guidance to the State Government to enact such a
legislation. (30) Section 2 of the Act contains the definition clause, the
relevant parts whereof have already been reproduced. Section 5 mandates that
any promoter, who desires to develop a land into a colony, shall have to apply
in the prescribed format with a prescribed fee to the competent authority for
grant of permission. Its sub-sections (1), (5), (6) & (7) are reproduced

(31) Section 32(1) of the Act obligates a promoter to whom a licence has been
granted under Section 5 or who has been exempted under Section 44, to deposit
service charges at the rate of rupee one per square metre of the plotted area
proposed to be developed by him. Sub-Section (3) provides that the amount of
service charges deposited by the promoter under Section (1) or recovered from
him under Sub-Section (2) shall constitute the "Punjab For Subsequent orders

Sub-Section (4) for development of the colonies, to promote research and
development in town and country and urban affairs, and for such other similar
purposes as may be prescribed.
(32) Section 44 of the Act deals with Exemption and it reads as follows:-
> "(1) Subject to the provisions of section 32, nothing in this Act shall
> apply if the promoter is,-
> (a) a local authority or statutory body constituted for the development of

> (b) a company or a body created for development of land or housing or

(33) From the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties read with
their exhaustive pleadings, we find that the following points arise for
consideration:-

Point Nos.(i) & (ii) (34) For the correct appreciation of these issues, it is
necessary to make reference firstly to Clause 10.4.1 of the Industrial Policy,
2003 which in so many words declared that in order to facilitate and encourage
private participation in Industrial Parks/Estates/Information Technology Parks
etc., the private or joint sectors shall be exempted from PAPRA, 1995. It was
in For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 33 of 43  ::: Downloaded on -
24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 34 - conformity with the said
policy that the petitioner's project to set up information technology park was
expressly exempted from PAPRA, 1995 vide Clause (x) of the memo dated
05.05.2006 (P3). No doubts were left in this regard when the petitioner and
the State Government entered into an agreement dated 11.10.2006 and para
5(iv)(j) whereof also exempted the petitioner's project from PAPRA, 1995
except that while issuing the final notification under Section 44(2) of the
Act, no exemption from the levy of "Punjab Urban Development Fund" was
granted. There has thus been a loud commitment by the respondents to keep the
project of the petitioner away from the effects of PAPRA, 1995 except to the
extent explained above. On a plain reading of the documents and policy and on
literal construction of their recitals, it can be safely inferred that the
respondents by taking a conscious decision, willfully entered into an
agreement thereby exempting the petitioner from PAPRA, 1995.
(35) The question, however, still remains as to what is the effect of Clause
(vii) of the approval letter dated 05.05.2006 read with para 5(iv)(q) of the
Agreement dated 11.10.2006? It may be seen that while according approval or
while granting exemption from PAPRA, 1995, the State Government informed the
petitioner in so many words that "proportionate cost of infrastructure
development which will be carried out by the State Government in the area
where the project is located, shall be borne by all the developers of
Information Technology Park/Industrial Park proportionately". The petitioner
not only accepted the above reproduced unilateral condition, it voluntarily
entered into the Agreement dated 11.10.2006 and bound itself down under sub-
clause (q) of para 5 to pay the For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 34 of
43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 35 -
proportionate cost of infrastructure development to be carried out by the
State Government in the area where the project is located. (36) It would be
apt at this stage to again notice the definition of 'External Development
Works' which "includes roads and road systems, water supply, sewerage and
drainage systems, electricity supply or any other work which may have to be
executed in the periphery, of or outside, a colony for its benefit". As
against it, the phrase "Infrastructure Development" has been illustrated in
para 5(iv)(e) of the Agreement, according to which, the 'Infrastructure
Development' "would include roads (including approach roads), water supply and
sewerage facilities, common effluent treatment facilities, telecom networks,
generation and distribution of power, parking facilities, parks, street lights
and such other facilities as are of common use for industrial activities which
are identifiable and are to be commonly used".
(37) From the comparative analysis of the above reproduced two expressions,
there should remain no doubt that the 'Infrastructure Development' is a very
expansive phrase which includes the 'External Development Works' as well.
'Infrastructure Development Works' are of wider configuration to include
certain works which do not find mention amongst the 'External Development
Works'. The State Government who alone is the competent authority to grant
exemption from the provisions of PAPRA, 1995, while granting special package
of incentives including exemption from PAPRA, 1995, has by way of a special
clause fastened the liability of paying proportionate cost of infrastructure
development on the petitioner. Such a special clause obligating the petitioner
to pay proportionate cost of infrastructure development has been expressly
inserted For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 35 of 43  ::: Downloaded on -
24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 36 - in the Agreement also. Not
only this, the infrastructure development works have been illustratively
defined in the Agreement itself to remove any room for doubt. Since the
petitioner voluntarily agreed and accepted the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, it cannot wriggle out of the consequences which are bound to fall
upon it.
(38) The petitioner's contention that there is no statutory backup to levy the
cost of infrastructure development, for there is no such provision in the
PAPRA, 1995, is wholly misconceived. Once the petitioner's project is exempted
from PAPRA, 1995, the affairs of the parties shall be governed by the terms
and conditions of the Agreement dated 11.10.2006. Further, since the External
Development Works stand included in the infrastructure development works,
there can be no escape but to hold that the petitioner is liable to pay such
charges as per the binding contract read with Section 5 of the PAPRA, 1995. It
is clarified that since the exemption from PAPRA, 1995 granted to the
petitioner was subject to its liability to pay proportionate cost towards
infrastructure development works, hence, there was no exemption to it in legal
parlance from the levy of 'external development charges' as defined in Section
2(p) read with Section 5 of PAPRA, 1995. Point Nos.(iii) & (iv) (39) It is
undeniable that as per para (6) of the Agreement dated 11.10.2006 if the
petitioner-company was unable to comply with provisions of para 5(i), 5(ii)
and 5(iii) within the stipulated period of three years commencing from
29.03.2006 (which was later on extended upto 28.03.2012, with a further
renewal offer under the new policy decision dated 06.02.2015), the concessions
enumerated in para 5(iv) were liable to be automatically withdrawn. Since we
have viewed that the petitioner is liable For Subsequent orders see
CWP-5620-2015 36 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP
No.5213 of 2015 - 37 - to pay the proportionate costs towards infrastructure
development works which include the 'External Development Works' within the
meaning of Section 5 of PAPRA, 1995, it is not necessary to dwell upon the
implications of petitioner's failure to make an investment of `952 crore
within the initially agreed and/or subsequently extended period. (40) We,
however, hasten to add that the respondent-GMADA's plea that the time is the
essence of the contract and the petitioner having failed to honour the
prescribed time schedule is not entitled to any concessions/incentives, merits
rejection. The time limit was prescribed by the State Government while it
entered into agreement with the petitioner on 11.10.2006. The State Government
thereafter at its own has extended the time limit repeatedly and its latest
policy dated 06.02.2015 (R3) conclusively establishes its inclination towards
the completion of projects by granting concession/relief in the agreed time
schedules, for which an offer has been made even to the petitioner also. Since
the respondents themselves are not keen to adhere to the time schedule, we
hold that GMADA has no authority to assume the role of State Government or to
invoke Para 6 of the Agreement to say that the petitioner has lost its right
to claim concessions due to the 'expiry' of time period, within which the
project was required to be completed.
Point No.(v) (41) The petitioner's claim that the respondents are estopped by
their act and conduct from levying EDC or that after exemption from PAPRA,
1995, it legitimately expected not to be burdened with EDC has to be held to
be misconceived and misdirected in view of the findings returned on point
Nos.(i) & (ii) above. The State Government while granting special package For
Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 37 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016
13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 38 - of incentives on 05.05.2006, expressly
informed the petitioner of its liability towards proportionate cost of
infrastructure development and it was thereafter that both the parties knowing
fully well the implications of such clause, entered into the Agreement dated
11.10.2006. The petitioner having agreed with open eyes to pay the
proportionate cost of infrastructure development cannot turn around and invoke
the principle of 'promissory estoppel' against the respondents as what the
petitioner has been asked to pay is necessarily a component of the cost
towards infrastructure development works only. So long as the respondents have
not withdrawn the exemption from PAPRA, 1995 which might result into levy of
other statutory charges on the petitioner, it cannot be said that the
respondents have acted contrary to their promise. Similarly, the petitioner
cannot be heard to say that it 'legitimately expected' not to pay the
proportionate cost of infrastructure development works even after it agreed to
share such liability while entering into agreement. We thus do not find any
merit in this contention as well.
Point No.(vi) (42) As regard to the plea of discrimination, it was vehemently
contended that the petitioner's project is similar to that of M/s Janta Land
Promoters or M/s Chandigarh Overseas Pvt. Ltd. and since their projects have
been fully exempted under the orders of this Court from payment of any EDC or
the proportionate towards infrastructure development works, the respondents
cannot be permitted to exempt one project 'completely' or the other
'partially'. On a minute consideration of the contention, it is apparent that
the terms and conditions of the Agreements dated 24.06.2005 between State of
Punjab and M/s Janta Land Promoters (R6), dated 03.04.2006 For Subsequent
orders see CWP-5620-2015 38 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 :::
CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 39 - between State of Punjab and M/s Chandigarh Overseas
Pvt. Ltd. on the one hand, and those of the agreement dated 11.10.2006 between
the petitioner and the State of Punjab are distinctly different. There was no
clause to levy proportionate cost of infrastructure development works or
External Development Works in the agreements entered with M/s Janta Land
Promoters and M/s Chandigarh Overseas. Later on, such a liability was sought
to be fastened on them against which their respective writ petitions were
allowed vide judgments dated 26.11.2010 and 09.09.2013 (P18 & P19).
Contrarily, somewhat similar clause was inserted in the agreement dated
15.10.2007 between State of Punjab and M/s Hansa Tubes Pvt. Ltd. who
challenged the levy of EDC and claimed parity with M/s Janta Land Promoters
and Chandigarh Overseas. A Division Bench of this Court to which one of us
(Surya Kant, J) was a member, turned down the plea of discrimination vide
order dated 29.09.2014 passed in CWP No.23053 of 2010 (Hansa Tubes Pvt. Ltd.
Vs. State of Punjab & Ors.) and held that :-
> "Thus, whereas in the agreement in Janta Lands' case, there was no specific
> qualification to the condition of ensuring connectivity to power, roads
> etc., in the present case, it is clearly stipulated that the proportionate
> costs of any infrastructure upgradation would be borne by the Company.
> Hence, as regards external development charges, both the cases run on their

> 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 40 - Therefore, as already
> held by us, external development charges are very much payable by the
> petitioner in the present case, even though they were not payable by M/s
> Janta Land Promoters Ltd."
(43) For the reasons assigned in M/s Hansa Tubes Pvt. Ltd., the petitioner
cannot claim parity with M/s Janta Land Promoters case. Needless to say that
the terms and conditions of the Agreement levying liability towards cost of
infrastructure development are not under challenge in these proceedings.
(44) The claim of the petitioner, nonetheless, in so far as its challenge to
the levy of Change of Land Use (CLU) charges, merits acceptance in view of
specific exemption granted to it from the levy of such charges under Para
5(iv)(c) of the Agreement dated 11.10.2006. It has already been held that the
respondents themselves have been granting extension and are further inclined
to grant further extension through the later policy dated 06.02.2015 and thus
cannot invoke Para 6 of the Agreement dated 11.10.2006, hence the petitioner
cannot be fastened with any liability towards CLU charges. The payment, if
any, made by the petitioner towards CLU charges shall be adjusted against the
proportionate cost of infrastructure development works.
(45) Similarly, the petitioner has a valid claim against the demand towards
'Social Infrastructure Fund'. This Court has set aside an identical demand in
M/s Hansa Tubes Pvt. Ltd. (supra) as it was found that such a charge was
without any legal backing. For the reasons assigned in M/s Hansa Tubes Pvt.
Ltd., it is held that the petitioner is not liable to pay the social
infrastructure fund and the amount, if any, already paid towards it, is For
Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 40 of 43  ::: Downloaded on - 24-12-2016
13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 41 - directed to be adjusted against the
arrears of proportionate cost of infrastructure works.
(46) Adverting to the petitioner's challenge to the levy of Licence Fee, Sh.
Khosla, learned senior counsel for GMADA has very fairly clarified that as per
the terms and conditions of Agreement no Licence Fee is leviable on the
"industrial component" which is 60% of the total licensed area. However, there
is no exemption of 'licence fee' on the "residential and commercial
components" of the project which constitute 40% of the total area. The
clarification given on behalf of GMADA appears to be correct as the petitioner
too has not questioned the same. The respondents shall thus work out the
petitioner's liability towards licence fee accordingly and if anything is
found to have been paid in excess, the same shall be adjusted towards other
permissible liabilities.
(47) So far as the petitioner's liability towards 'Punjab Urban Development
Fund' is concerned, it is totally inescapable for the reasons that firstly the
petitioner has been expressly declined such exemption of Section 32 of PAPRA,
1995 by way of Notification dated 29.10.2009. Secondly, the said notification
is not under challenge in petitioner's both the writ petitions. Thirdly, there
is even otherwise no prayer made by petitioner to exempt it from such
statutory charge. Fourthly, the demand has an express statutory back-up. Save
where the Court finds wrong with a provision of the Statute, it ought to be
given full effect. (48) As a result of the above discussion and findings, it
is reiterated that the petitioner is liable to pay proportionate cost towards
infrastructure development works and all the 'External Development Works' as
defined in PAPRA, 1995 are by implication included in the infrastructure
development For Subsequent orders see CWP-5620-2015 41 of 43  ::: Downloaded
on - 24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 42 - works. The inescapable
consequence would be that the impugned recovery notices served on the
petitioner are fully justified. (49) Having held so, we cannot be oblivious of
the fact that the time schedule extended by the State Government under its new
policy dated 06.02.2015 (R3), for giving one more opportunity to the project
promoters to clear the outstanding amount of EDC/licence fee etc. has since
expired. The respondents may be right to an extent in contending that the
petitioner lacks the financial capability to fulfill the promise for which it
entered into the Agreement or that it has consistently failed to honour the
commitment towards payment of due charges. At the same time, it has to be kept
in view that the petitioner has already invested more than `150 crores. If all
the doors are closed for the petitioner on a hyper-technical plea that the
time limit extended under the policy dated 06.02.2015 already stands expired,
the drastic consequence would be that the petitioner's project would suffer
hammer blow. It serves no one's purpose. While the State Government is
deservingly entitled to the timely receipt of its outstanding dues, its
merciful discretion in granting extension and more leverage to the petitioner
to make one more attempt for survival would be equally in larger public
interest. It goes without saying that if a prestigious project is brought back
on the right track, it would not only be a perennial resource to generate
revenue for the State but would also create employment, bring prosperity and
be an integral feature of a developed city. Keeping all these factors in view,
and taking notice of the fact that GMADA has acted a bit aggressively to stall
the petitioner's project instead of promoting it, we direct the Principal
Secretary to Government of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development
to consider/put up the petitioner's case for granting further extension for a
