Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1\. This order proposes to dispose of the objection to maintainability of this
suit, on the ground of the court lacking territorial jurisdiction, raised by
site of the plaintiff is concerned, in India TV (supra), this Court had, in
para 44, held that in order to extend jurisdiction to defendants residing
outside the territorial limits, on the basis of their presence on the
internet, the website of the defendants cannot be a mere passive one but has
to be interactive, in the sense that something purposeful should be directed
towards the forum state. The print outs of the second defendant's website
submitted by the plaintiff, in the list of documents, do not in any manner
disclose the minimum threshold of interactivity laid down in India TV (supra).
The copies merely disclose the range of products sold by the defendants and
nothing more. There is no purposeful direction of the defendants web
activities to the concerned geographical locale, in this case Delhi, to prima
facie establish this Court's jurisdiction.
CS(OS) 641/2007 11 of 12
20\. This court, therefore, is of the view that taken together, the suit
averments, and the documents do not disclose that the dispute in this case can
be entertained and tried by this court; it plainly lacks territorial
suit, on the ground of the court lacking territorial jurisdiction, raised by
the defendant. The present suit has been filed to restrain the defendants from
infringing the trademark of the plaintiffs' and passing off their goods as the
plaintiffs' goods. The plaintiffs have also sought rendition of accounts and
delivery up of goods.
CS(OS) 641/2007 1 of 12
2\. The first plaintiff is a company organized under the laws of Luxembourg.
The second plaintiff with its registered office in Mumbai, is its subsidiary
in India. It is averred that the plaintiffs form part of the fastest growing
research oriented pharmaceutical companies and have been one of the leading
healthcare companies in the world. It is also averred that the plaintiffs set
up their India operation in the year 1950 in Bombay.
3\. Apart from a wide range of products marketed in India by the plaintiffs,
they also market in India 'Dalacin', a product, which is the essential
component of 'Dalacin C' and 'Dalacin T'. Dalacin is a highly sought after
antibiotic used to treat infections in different parts of the body caused by
bacteria, the active ingredient of which is Clindamycin. It is averred that
they market chemical compositions Clindamycin hydrochloride and Clindamycin
phosphate under the mark Dalacin C. They aslo state that the mark 'Dalacin C'
was first adopted by the Upjohn Company in 1968 in India; (whose name was
later changed to Pharmacia & Upjohn Company in 1996). The mark was later
assigned to Pharmacia Enterprises SA in 2002, which was subsequently renamed
Pfizer Enterprises SARL, the first plaintiff. It is averred that the aforesaid
trademark is a fanciful and coined word having no denotative meaning and is
therefore, a distinctive mark. Further, it is stated that the first plaintiff
is the proprietor of the aforesaid trademark by virtue of its priority in
adoption, continuous and extensive use, and widespread advertisement. Both
'Dalacin C' and 'Dalacin CS(OS) 641/2007 2 of 12 T' have been registered in
India; No. 247943 and No. 389213 respectively. The second plaintiff is the
authorized user of these trademarks in India. They aver that due to the
extensive use and the reputation of the plaintiffs, the aforesaid trademark
has come to be exclusively identified with the plaintiffs.
4\. It is further averred that the second defendant, a company carrying on its
business activities from Mumbai, also manufactures an antibacterial product
having Clindamycin as its active ingredient. The plaintiffs state that in
March 2007 they were shocked to discover from their sources as well the
defendant's website that the second defendant offers pharmaceutical
compositions Clindamycin hydrochloride and Clindamycin phosphate under the
mark 'Dalcinex', in both capsule and injection form as the plaintiffs do. The
plaintiffs allege that such use of the mark Dalcinex by the defendant amounts
to infringement and because the defendants want to dishonestly want to
appropriate the goodwill of the plaintiffs, also amounts to passing off. It is
averred that the defendant's mark is phonetically and visually similar to that
of the plaintiffs', in relation to an identical product and therefore, would
cause confusion in the minds of the public. It is further stated that the
plaintiffs' mark being an arbitrary and unique collocation of words, is
distinctive, and therefore, cannot be adopted by the defendants in such
dishonest fashion.
5\. The plaintiffs also submit that this Court has the jurisdiction to
entertain the present CS(OS) 641/2007 3 of 12 suit, by virtue of Section
134(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereafter 'the Act'), as the plaintiffs'
product 'Dalacin C' is available for sale and distribution in Delhi and also
because the defendants' product is also available for sale in Delhi.
Therefore, it avers that part of the cause of action has also arisen within
Delhi.
6\. The defendants allege that none of the plaintiffs are the registered
proprietors of the trademarks 'Dalacin C' and 'Dalacin T' within the meaning
of section 2(i)(v) of the Act and hence no suit for infringement is
maintainable. They also allege the assignment deeds produced by the plaintiffs
are not valid and cannot be relied upon. They aver about having applied for
registration of the mark Dalcinex which is pending since the year 2004, and
also having commenced manufacturing in 2004. Therefore, they aver the present
suit if hit by delay and latches.
7\. Mr. Ajay Sahni, learned counsel for the defendants contended that the suit
is not maintainable in this Court, since both the plaintiffs and the
defendants carry on business outside the jurisdiction of this Court. He
submits that this position is admitted by the plaintiffs in para 10 of the
plaint. He submits that no documentary evidence has been filed on record to
even prima facie establish that the product of the defendants, on the date of
filing the suit was available within the jurisdiction of this Court. He also
drew the attention of this Court to the fact that the plaintiffs have not
averred or produced any document as to CS(OS) 641/2007 4 of 12 how the
defendants' product including the packaging has been procured in Delhi. He
submitted that the suit ought to be filed either in the place where the
defendants resides and carries on business or the place at which the cause of
action arises. Placing reliance on Dabur India v. KR Industries 2008 (37) PTC
332 (SC), which affirmed this Court's finding, on jurisdiction it was argued
that unless the cause of action arises within territorial limits of this
Court, that is, and unless the defendants' allegedly infringing products are
sold in Delhi, this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction. He also argued that
when both parties are from the same place, the suit should be filed there and
the tendency of the plaintiffs to file the case elsewhere should strongly
deprecated. In this regard he relied on Asst. Collector Central Excise,
Chandan Nagar v. Dunlop India Ltd., (1985) 1 SCC 260. Further, placing
reliance on Kensoft Infotech v. Krishnswami, 2007 (35) PTC 627, he submitted
that since the proceedings are filed in a forum non conveniens in relation to
the defendants, the Court may in its discretion return the plaint. He urged
that Court must reject the plaint, since the plaint does not disclose a cause
of action.
8\. Learned Counsel also sought to address the Court on the validity of the
assignment deed; how the deed was insufficiently stamped and was also invalid
under section 45 of the Act. He submitted that curiously, copies of the
certificates of renewal of trademark from the year 1982 do not have the name
of the proprietor on them. Further, he submitted that the plaintiff failed to
establish the ingredients for an action of passing off. Finally, he argued
that where the mark has been coined using the alphabets of the generic salt,
or ingredient no exclusive right could be asserted.
CS(OS) 641/2007 5 of 12
9\. Mr. Ankush Mahajan, contended, on the other hand that there are clear
averments in the suit about the cause of action having arisen within
jurisdiction of the Court, and the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.
Counsel contended that after commencement of the Trademark Act, 1999, there
has been a shift in the law and that by virtue of Section 134, the plaintiff
has the choice of suing the defendant, even if some business is carried on by
it (the plaintiff).
10\. It was contended that to determine whether a court has jurisdiction, all
that can be seen is whether there is sufficient averment in the plaint. In
this case, the plaintiff had relied on averments to allege sufficient nexus
for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the cause. Counsel submitted that
the description of the threat of infringement, perceived by the plaintiff was
sufficient nexus for exercising jurisdiction. He relied on the judgment of
this Court reported as Pfizer Products Inc Vs. Rajesh Chopra 147 (2007) DLT
300 as well as the previous decision in Pfizer Products Inc. Vs. Rajesh Chopra
2006 (32) PTC 301. Counsel also relied upon the decisions reported as Exphar
SA -vs- Eupharma Laboratories Ltd. 2004 (28) PTC 251 (SC) and Intas
Pharmaceuticals -vs- Allergan Inc 2006 (32) PTC 272 (Del).
11\. Learned counsel contended that sale of the defendant's goods is something
that cannot be denied. Being engaged in Pharmaceutical business, it would be
inconceivable that the second defendant carries no business within
jurisdiction of this Court. It was also CS(OS) 641/2007 6 of 12 submitted that
since the defendants have entered appearance, and are contesting proceedings,
it would not be appropriate at this stage to return the plaint, on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction. Learned counsel relied upon the documents filed and
submitted that the defendants are marketing their products and advertising
through the Internet. He relied on a copy of the print out of the website
www.cipla.com and submitted that entire product range of the defendants is
listed on such website. It was submitted that the website can be accessed from
Delhi and thus, this Court possesses jurisdiction. Reliance was placed upon
judgments of this Court including Casio India Ltd. v. Ashita Telesystems Pvt.
Ltd. (2003) 27 PTC 265 (Del) as well as the India TV Independent News Pvt Ltd.
v. India Broadcast Live LLC 2007(35) PTC 177 (Del).
12\. The Court had listed the matter for consideration of the interlocutory
application for ad interim relief; the defendant at that stage raised a
preliminary objection to maintainability. The court therefore, heard arguments
on the maintainability of the suit on grounds of territorial jurisdiction and
reserved orders.
13\. It is well settled that the court has to see only the contents of the
plaint to decide whether the suit discloses a triable cause of action, and
whether this court has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court in Liverpool & London
SP & I Asson. Ltd. v. MV Sea Success, (2004) 9 SCC 512, held that for the
purposes of Order 7 Rule 11 the Court should not only look at the averments in
the plaint but also examine into documents filed along with, in view of Order
7 CS(OS) 641/2007 7 of 12 Rule 14. In Sopan Sukhdeo v. Assistant Charity
Commr., (2004) 3 SCC 137, the Supreme Court emphasized that a meaningful, and
not formal reading of the plaint has to be adopted so as to nip in the bud any
clever drafting of the plaint. Therefore, in order to decide the issue of
jurisdiction and to assess whether the plaint discloses a cause of action,
only the contents of the plaint along with the documents filed are relevant.
14\. The following fora are provided by Section 20 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, (hereafter the 'CPC') Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act,
1957 and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, for the adjudication of
trademark disputes. First, the place at which the defendant actually and
voluntarily resides or carries on business. Second, the place at which the
cause of action, wholly or in part arises. Lastly, by an amendment to the
Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act, the suit can be instituted at the place
where the plaintiff resides and carries on business. The Explanation to
section 20 of the CPC makes it clear that the place at which a corporate
entity carries on business is either the place at which it has its sole or
principle office or where it has a subordinate office.
15\. In Indian Performing Rights Society v. Sanjay Dalia, 143 (2007) DLT 617,
this Court, relying on Loknath Prasad Gupta v. Bijay Kumar Gupta, 57(1995) DLT
502, held that the expression 'carries on business' in section 62 of the
Copyright Act has the same meaning as in Section 20 of the CPC. It was further
held that the mere existence of a branch office in Delhi would not mean that
the plaintiff carries on business in Delhi. The plaintiff would be deemed to
carry on business at a branch office only if a cause of action had arisen in
Delhi. A well established principle of law is that to amount "to carrying on
business" in a certain CS(OS) 641/2007 8 of 12 place, the essential part of
the business must take place in that place. (Dhodha House v. SK Maingi, (2006)
9 SCC 41; Nedungadi Bank v. Central Bank of India, AIR 1961 Ker 50; Bharat
Insurance Co. v. Vasudev, AIR 1956 Nag 203).
16\. In Dodha House, the Supreme Court observed that it was possible that the
goods manufactured by the plaintiff were available in the markets in Delhi or
they are sold in Delhi, but that by itself would not mean that the plaintiff
carries on any business in Delhi. In SectorTwenty-one Owners' Welfare
Association v. Air Force Naval Housing Board, 65 (1997) DLT 81 (DB) it was
held that a trivial or insignificant part of the cause of action arising at a
particular place would not be enough to confer jurisdiction on the court to
entertain the lis. Citing a number of precedents the court held that the
emphasis had shifted from the residence or location of the person or authority
sought to be proceeded against, to the situs of the accrual of the cause of
action. In H.P. Horticulture Produce Marketing and Processing Corpn. v. M.M
Breweries, AIR 1981 P&H 117, in relation to action for passing off the Court
observed as follows:
> "In a case of present nature, the cause of action partly or wholly can arise
> in a given jurisdiction only if it is the defendant who is proved to have
> directly made sale of the goods under the impugned trademark (within a given
> court) not to an individual customer but to a distributor or a wholesaler or
> retailer and that such a sale should be at a commercial scale."
17\. In Gold Seal Engineering Products v. Hindustan Manufacturers, AIR 1992
Bom. 144, it was held that a suit for passing off could not be filed in Bombay
if the defendants carry on business in Calcutta and that supply of goods to
Delhi was on a commercial basis. In Gupta Brothers Conduit Pipe Manufacturing
Co. v. Anil Gupta, (2001) 24 PTC 159, this Court held that CS(OS) 641/2007 9
of 12 since neither plaintiff nor the defendants have offices in Delhi and are
not carrying on business in Delhi, the suit had to be returned due to lack of
jurisdiction. The court held, in Haryana Milk Foods v. Chambel Diary Products,
(2002) 25 PTC 156 that for the purposes of ascertaining territorial
jurisdiction the entire plaint has to be taken into consideration. In that
case since the plaintiff could not prove that the defendant had a office in
Delhi or carried on business in Delhi, the Court held that it did not have
territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. In Dabur India Limited v.
KR Industries, (2006) 33 PTC 348, a Division Bench of this Court held that
since the defendant was from Andhra Pradesh and since there was no documentary
evidence to show that it was selling its goods in Delhi, this Court did not
have territorial jurisdiction. This decision has been recently affirmed by the
Supreme Court in Dabur India v. KR Industries 2008 (37) PTC 332 (SC).
18\. The plaint in the present case shows that both the second plaintiff and
the second defendant have their offices in Mumbai and undeniably carry on
their business in Mumbai too. The plaint does not disclose either of them
having their offices in Delhi. The relevant parts of the plaint are extracted
below :
> "16. The cause of action arose in favour of the plaintiff in the month of
> March 2007, when they came to learn of the availability of the Defendants'
> products in the market. The said Defendants are very much continuing with
> their infringing activity. The cause of action again arose when the
> plaintiff's visited the website of the Defendants located at
> http://www.cipla.com/ and found that the Defendants are advertising a
> pharmaceutical drug under the impugned mark DALCINEX having Clindamycin as
> its active ingredient. The cause of action is thus a continuing one and will
> continue to subsist until the said Defendants are restrained permanently by
> an order of permanent injunction passed by this Hon'ble Court.
17\. This Hon'ble High Court has necessary jurisdiction to entertain and try
the present Suit, by virtue of Section 134 (1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as
the Plaintiffs' CS(OS) 641/2007 10 of 12 products, including DALACIN C, are
available for sale & distribution within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court. Further, the Defendants' products under the impugned mark are available
for sale in Delhi and therefore, the cause of action has also arisen within
the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court."
The plaintiff far from establishing that the defendants carry out the
essential parts of their business from Delhi has not been able to demonstrate
that the defendants' goods are in fact sold in Delhi. Even the sample, which
is produced with the list of documents annexed to the plaint and relied upon
does not disclose whether the defendant's goods are sold; no invoice of sale,
from Delhi is placed on the record. The allegation, therefore, that plaintiff
has become aware of the infringing activities of the defendant, within
territorial jurisdiction of this court, or that any cause of action arose
within jurisdiction, are not even prima facie substantiated.
19\. As regards the argument about jurisdiction arising on account of the web
site of the plaintiff is concerned, in India TV (supra), this Court had, in
para 44, held that in order to extend jurisdiction to defendants residing
outside the territorial limits, on the basis of their presence on the
internet, the website of the defendants cannot be a mere passive one but has
to be interactive, in the sense that something purposeful should be directed
towards the forum state. The print outs of the second defendant's website
submitted by the plaintiff, in the list of documents, do not in any manner
disclose the minimum threshold of interactivity laid down in India TV (supra).
The copies merely disclose the range of products sold by the defendants and
nothing more. There is no purposeful direction of the defendants web
activities to the concerned geographical locale, in this case Delhi, to prima
facie establish this Court's jurisdiction.
CS(OS) 641/2007 11 of 12
20\. This court, therefore, is of the view that taken together, the suit
averments, and the documents do not disclose that the dispute in this case can
be entertained and tried by this court; it plainly lacks territorial
jurisdiction. The plaint is, therefore, returned.

3\. Apart from a wide range of products marketed in India by the plaintiffs,
they also market in India 'Dalacin', a product, which is the essential
component of 'Dalacin C' and 'Dalacin T'. Dalacin is a highly sought after
antibiotic used to treat infections in different parts of the body caused by
bacteria, the active ingredient of which is Clindamycin. It is averred that
they market chemical compositions Clindamycin hydrochloride and Clindamycin
phosphate under the mark Dalacin C. They aslo state that the mark 'Dalacin C'
was first adopted by the Upjohn Company in 1968 in India; (whose name was
later changed to Pharmacia & Upjohn Company in 1996). The mark was later
assigned to Pharmacia Enterprises SA in 2002, which was subsequently renamed
Pfizer Enterprises SARL, the first plaintiff. It is averred that the aforesaid
trademark is a fanciful and coined word having no denotative meaning and is
therefore, a distinctive mark. Further, it is stated that the first plaintiff
is the proprietor of the aforesaid trademark by virtue of its priority in
adoption, continuous and extensive use, and widespread advertisement. Both
'Dalacin C' and 'Dalacin CS(OS) 641/2007 2 of 12 T' have been registered in
India; No. 247943 and No. 389213 respectively. The second plaintiff is the
authorized user of these trademarks in India. They aver that due to the
extensive use and the reputation of the plaintiffs, the aforesaid trademark
site of the plaintiff is concerned, in India TV (supra), this Court had, in
para 44, held that in order to extend jurisdiction to defendants residing
outside the territorial limits, on the basis of their presence on the
internet, the website of the defendants cannot be a mere passive one but has
to be interactive, in the sense that something purposeful should be directed
towards the forum state. The print outs of the second defendant's website
submitted by the plaintiff, in the list of documents, do not in any manner
disclose the minimum threshold of interactivity laid down in India TV (supra).
The copies merely disclose the range of products sold by the defendants and
nothing more. There is no purposeful direction of the defendants web
activities to the concerned geographical locale, in this case Delhi, to prima
facie establish this Court's jurisdiction.

averments, and the documents do not disclose that the dispute in this case can
be entertained and tried by this court; it plainly lacks territorial
suit, on the ground of the court lacking territorial jurisdiction, raised by
the defendant. The present suit has been filed to restrain the defendants from
infringing the trademark of the plaintiffs' and passing off their goods as the
plaintiffs' goods. The plaintiffs have also sought rendition of accounts and
delivery up of goods.
