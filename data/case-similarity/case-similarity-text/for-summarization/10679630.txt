S. MURALIDHAR, J.
1\. Admit. With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the appeal is
taken up for final hearing.
2\. This appeal is directed against the impugned order dated 11 th July 2008
passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the appellant‟s IA No. 9140 of
2007 being application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 („CPC‟) in suit CS (OS) No. 1454 of 2007 filed against the
respondent-defendant. The prayer in IA No.9140 of 2007 was FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 1 of 24 for an ad interim injunction restraining the defendant
from manufacturing, selling, marketing, advertising or in any manner
whatsoever using the trademarks „SUPER BRIGHT‟, SUPER BRIGHT EL‟, „SUPER
BRIGHT EL-C‟, „SUPER BRIGHT EL-81‟, „SUPER BRIGHT HD ULTRA‟ and „SUPER BRIGHT
Bleach‟ or any other trademark which is deceptively similar or confusingly
similar to the above trademarks.
3\. The appellant is in the business of manufacturing and selling various
detergent products. The case of the appellant is that it has developed several
unique and novel detergent products solely on the basis of its own research.
Its products are being marketed and sold under the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟
followed by suffixes, such as EL, EL-C, EL-81, HD ULTRA,etc . These products,
according to the appellant, identify specific detergent products. The
documents placed on record in the suit go to show that the appellant has been
using the trade mark since 1990 in respect of detergent chemicals. In the year
1999 the appellant developed two different products and starting marketing its
products as „SUPER BRIGHT ULTRA‟ and „SUPER BRIGHT EL-81‟. In the year 2001 it
applied for and initiated talks for supply of its „SUPER BRIGHT‟ range of
detergent to the Armed Forces for use in various Army hospitals all over the
country. It is submitted that the appellant developed specific formulations
for the Army and on 12 th October 2004 Director General of Armed Forces
(Medical Services) called the appellant for a technical discussion regarding
the products. The sample of the appellant‟s product was tested and approved by
the army FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 2 of 24 establishments. In June 2004 the
appellant was awarded ISO 9001: 2000 Quality System by International
Certifications Limited. On 17 th August 2006 the appellant applied for
registration of its trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ under Class 3 of the Schedule to
the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the said application is stated to be pending
registration with the Registrar of Trade Marks. In the plaint the appellant
has given the sale figures for the product „SUPER BRIGHT‟ for the last four
years are as follows:
                       Year                Net Sales (Rs.)
                    2003-2004              1,26,44,573.36
                    2004-2005              1,43,75,606.61
                    2005-2006              2,43,36,047.47
                    2006-2007              4,87,17,617.88
4\. It is claimed that on account of the popularity of its product and use of
the mark by it, the appellant has become the exclusive owner of the trade mark
SUPER BRIGHT and that any use to the contrary without the leave and consent of
the appellant would constitute passing off and encroachment upon the
appellant‟s intellectual property.
5\. On 20th December 2004 the Director General of Ordinances Service s
(Procurement Division) invited tenders for supply of „SUPER BRIGHT Bleached
(not for coloured cloth).‟ The technical specification of product was also
indicated. The requirement as to marking on the packages, as FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 3 of 24 indicated in the terms and conditions attached to the
tender form reads as under:
> "6. Marking: On initial pack,
> (a) Cat/Part No. NIV, Nomenclature, Name of manufacture, quality contained
> therein shall be legibly and indelibly marked on each container.
> (b) On final pack. Cat/part No. NIV, Nomenclature, Name of manufacture,
> quality contained therein shall be legibly and indelibly marked on each
> container also A/T No. and date, inspection Note No. and date, Name and
> address of manufacturer, Name and address of the consignee should be clearly
> visible.
The tenderer has also to fill the questionnaire which is column No. 8 requires
to indicate "whether you are the manufacturer of the stores"
6\. According to the defendant, the Army follows two separate processes for
inviting tenders. One is the PAC tendering which is resorted to when the Army
seeks to purchase a proprietary product of a manufacturing firm. There is also
an open tender mode of procurement for common use items of generic or
commercial specifications to ensure adequate competition. The tender in the
instant case was invited following an "Open Tender" procedure whereby the Army
had used the word „SUPER BRIGHT‟ as a descriptive term to describe the product
as per specifications provided in the tender documents, and not as a brand
name for the product manufactured by the appellant. Ten parties participated
in the tender for supply of the aforementioned product „SUPER BRIGHT‟
detergent. According to the FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 4 of 24 defendant-
respondent, it was awarded contract by the Army for supply of both products
„SUPER BRIGHT EL and EL-81 on 23rd June 2005. Likewise tenders were invited by
the Army for the supply of „SUPER BRIGHT Bleach" in February 2006 and pursuant
to the bid offered by it the defendant-respondent was awarded that contract on
25th April 2006. Another tender advertisement was issued on 28th September
2006 for „SUPER BRIGHT Bleach‟ and the respondent was awarded that contract on
31st May 2007.
7\. According to the appellant, it came to its knowledge sometime in June 2007
that the respondent had submitted a bid for the supply of the SUPER BRIGHT
range of chemicals to Army Hospitals. Immediately the appellant published a
trade mark caution notice in leading newspapers cautioning the public not to
deal in the products under the trade mark SUPER BRIGHT except those
originating from the appellant. Likewise it also wrote to the Government
authorities (Armed Forces) informing that the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ is a
property of the appellant and that the respondent has no authority to use the
said trade mark. A legal notice was also issued to the respondent. The
appellant contended that there was a likelihood of confusion on the part of
the public, including associating the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ used by the
respondent with the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ of the plaintiff; that the
adoption of the mark by the respondent was both „deceptively and confusingly
similar‟ and „completely dishonest and mala fide.‟ Accordingly, the appellant
filed the FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 5 of 24 aforementioned suit in this Court
on 13th August 2007. The aforementioned application being IA No. 9140 of 2007
under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC was also simultaneously filed.
8\. After notice was issued in the suit, the defendant appeared on 20th August
2007 and informed the learned Single Jude that "the defendant has been
supplying goods to Army and other authorities under the same trademark since
the year 2005." The learned Single Judge then passed the following conditional
order on 20th August 2007:
> "20.08.2007 Present: Mr. C.M. Lall, Advocate for the plaintiff.
> Mr. Salim Inamdar, Advocate for the defendant.
CS(OS) No. 1454/2007 & IA No. 9140/2007 (O 39 R 1
> & 2CPC) Learned counsel for the defendant has entered appearance and as
> prayed for is granted three weeks time to file the written statement, reply
> and documents. Replication and rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks
> thereafter.
> Learned counsel for the defendant states that he has obtained instructions
> that the defendant has been supplying goods to Army and other authorities
> under the same trademark since the year 2005.
> It has been put to learned counsel for the defendant that in case these
> averments are found incorrect, the Court would even examine the aspect of
> interim compensatory FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 6 of 24 damages while
> deciding the interlocutory application since no interim relief has been
> granted to the plaintiff in view of this stand of the defendant.
> List on 9.10.2007."
9\. After pleadings were complete, the plaintiff apparently filed three
interlocutory applications IA Nos. 11203/2007, 13536/2007 and 10753/2007
seeking an ad interim injunction against the respondent. In these
applications, the plaintiff sought to point out that the statement made by the
defendant before the learned Single Judge on 20 th August 2007 was erroneous.
However, according to the defendant, since the learned Single Judge was not
inclined to grant any interim relief, the plaintiff withdrew IA No. 10753 of
2007.
10\. The learned Single Judge took up the application IA No. 9140 of 2007 for
disposal and formulated the following question:
> "5. This case raises interesting questions relating to passing off. This is
> so because, according to the defendant, the Army has invited tenders from
> time to time in respect of various kinds „SUPER BRIGHT‟ detergents. The
> defendant has submitted its bid for the said detergents on the understanding
> that „SUPER BRIGHT‟ is only used as a description along with suffixes so as
> to identify the products according to the specifications given in the tender
> invitations. The defendant has never FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 7 of 24
> regarded „SUPER BRIGHT‟ as a brand name or a trademark. Interestingly, the
> defendant does not supply or sell any of its products in the open market
> under the mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. The only supplies that are made, are to the
> Army on the basis of tenders invited by the Army. The interesting question
> of passing off that arises is
> \- whether in such circumstances, where a single consumer invites tenders
> for a particular product using the mark 'SUPER BRIGHT' along with its
> suffixes and several persons submit their bids for the same products, do
> such persons intend to pass off their products as those of others?"
> (emphasis supplied)
11\. The learned Single Judge opined that the question whether the defendant
intended to pass off its products as those of the plaintiff when it was the
Army which invited tenders which used the word „SUPER BRIGHT‟ was a debatable
question and could not be decided at that stage "without examining the
evidence that may be led by the parties." The learned Single Judge
nevertheless held that the plaintiff was aware in December 2004 that "there
was other parties, including the defendant, who were submitted their bids and
that at times the tenders were not being awarded in part or in whole to the
plaintiff." It was accordingly held that this would "disentitle the plaintiff
to an interim injunction and the plaintiff would have to wait for a final
decision in the suit."
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 8 of 24
12\. Towards the end of the impugned order dated 11 th July 2008 the learned
Single Judge recorded the following assurances of the defendant:
> "7. ....... It must, however, be noted that the learned counsel for the
> defendant assured this court that it is only supplying its detergents in
> response to the Army tenders which indicate the words „SUPER BRIGHT‟ and
> that the defendant by itself does not market or sell any detergents in the
> market to any other consumer under the mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. The defendant
> shall abide by this undertaking and assurance till the disposal of the suit.
> It is also made clear that the non-grant of an injunction to the plaintiff
> quo supplies being made to the Army by the defendant would not, in any way,
> prejudice the plaintiff‟s case in respect of any other customers or the
> public at large and would not create any special equities in favour of the
> defendant qua the proprietorship of the mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟.
13\. We have heard the submissions of Mr. C.M. Lal, learned counsel for the
appellant and Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned counsel for the respondent.
14\. Mr. Lal submitted that the defendant misled the learned Single Judge by
making a statement on 20th August 2007 to the effect that it has been
supplying the product in question to the Army since 2005. This was a blatant
falsehood as admittedly the supplies were made by the defendant to FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 9 of 24 the Army only in March 2007. The statement to the
contrary by the defendant before the learned Single Judge was the principal
reason why the plaintiff was not granted an ad interim injunction even at that
stage. He submits that once the factual premise on which the order dated 20th
August 2007 was proved to be false, an ad interim injunction in favour of the
plaintiff should have automatically followed. He submits that the appellant
could in any event not have come to the Court at any earlier point in time,
since the use of the trade mark of the plaintiff by the defendant would
actually commence only with the supply of the product under that mark and that
was when the plaintiff actually could have complained of infringement.
Therefore, the learned Single Judge erred in denying an interim injunction to
the plaintiff on the ground of either laches or acquiescence.
15\. The defendant has chosen to file a reply dated 1 st September 2008
supported by an affidavit in the present appeal. While Mr. Akhil Sibal,
learned counsel for the defendant was hard pressed to deny the fact that the
statement made on behalf of the defendant to the learned Single Judge on 20th
August 2007 was incorrect, he accused the plaintiff of suppressing a material
fact that the invitation by the Army of the tender for supply of SUPERBRIGHT
detergent was through the „open tender process‟ and not the PAC process.
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 10 of 24
16\. As regards the conduct of the defendant, in paras 4 and 5 of the
memorandum of appeal the appellant has averred thus:
> "4. Thereafter, pleadings were completed and documents filed by both parties
> which conclusively established that the defendant/respondent in the first
> instance had not even attempted to supply goods to any "other authorities"
> as stated by the defendant before Court on August 20, 2007. In its written
> statement the defendant itself stated that:
> "It is significant to note however that the defendant supplies its product
> to the Army and has not launched or advertised its product in the open
> market."
> Hence, the statement made to the learned Single Judge that the defendant
> supplied goods to "other authorities" since 2005 is clearly false.
> 5\. In fact, the learned Single Judge in his order has categorically
> recorded the statement of the defendant. The order of the learned Single
> Judge records:
> "It must, however, be noted that the learned counsel for the defendant
> assured this Court that it is only supplying its detergent to the Army
> tenders which indicate the words SUPER BRIGHT and that the defendant by
> itself does not market or sell any detergents in its market to any other
> consumer under the mark SUPER BRIGHT."
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 11 of 24
> The learned Single Judge, has in the humble opinion of the
> plaintiff/appellant completely ignored the contradictory statements made by
> the defendant after different points of time. The equities were clearly
> against the defendant for its dishonest conduct."
17\. In its reply dated 1st September 2008 the respondent defendant has stated
as under:
> "That in reply to paragraphs 4 and 5, it is admitted that the respondent has
> never supplied to any consumer other than the Army and that the respondent
> does not supply its product in the open market. However, it is submitted
> that this fact was clearly brought out in the written statement and it was
> never the intention of the respondent to mislead this Hon‟ble Court.
> Nevertheless, to the extent that the statement as recorded in the order
> dated 20.8.2007 was not accurate, the answering respondent sincerely and
> unequivocally apologizes to this Hon'ble Court and reiterates that it was
> never the intention of the answering respondent to mislead this Hon'ble
> Court. It may be noted, as stated above, that the respondent ahs willfully
> suppressed in the instant FAO the interim applications filed subsequently by
> the appellant (IA Nos. 11203/2007, 13536/2007 and 10753/2007) before the
> same learned Single Judge who had passed the order dated 20.8.2007 FAO(OS)
> No. 364/2008 Page 12 of 24 and who failed to grant any relief to the
> Appellant in the said applications. Instead of inviting a dismissal, the
> appellant chose to withdraw the last of such applications filed. It may be
> noted further that as recorded in the impugned order, the respondent assured
> the learned Single Judge that it is only supplying its product using the
> words „Super Bright‟ in response to the Army tenders and that the respondent
> does not market or sell any detergents in the market to any other consumer
> using the said words and to that extent, the learned Single Judge has in the
> impugned order directed that the respondent shall abide by its undertaking
> and assurance till the disposal of the suit. As such, no prejudice has been
> caused to the appellant as no supplies have been made at any point by the
> respondent to anyone other than the Army and to that extent the impugned
> order protects the appellant. It is denied that the equities were against
> the respondent." (emphasis supplied)
18\. Again, in para 6 of the memorandum of appeal it is stated as under:
> "6. Additionally the pleadings established that the defendant/ respondent
> had not made even a single supply to the Army prior to 2007. The statement
> that it had "been supplying goods to Army" since 2005 has been established
> as false. The award of a tender in favour of the defendant/ respondent does
> not constitute supply of goods."
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 13 of 24
19\. In reply thereto the defendant states as under:
> "6. That in reply to paragraph 6, it is submitted that on the basis of the
> documents adduced by the respondent in the suit. It is clear that the first
> formal supply orders were placed by the Army upon the respondent in June
> 2005, which have been suppressed by the appellant in the instant FAO.
> Further, the appellant framed its allegations of unfair trade practice and
> passing off on the sole basis of the respondent‟s action of „offering‟ its
> product to the Army using the mark „Super Bright‟. The pleadings filed by
> the respondent clearly stated that this act of „offering‟ its product to the
> Army using the words „Super Bright‟ was in consonance with the tender
> process of the Army and the conditions regarding nomenclature incorporated
> therein. The fact of actual physical supplies was never made a basis for
> seeking relief either in the suit or in the application for interim relief.
> Notwithstanding what is stated hereinabove, to the extent that the statement
> recorded in the Order dated 20th August 2007 suggests that the actual
> physical supplies were made to the Army since 2005, the respondent sincerely
> and unequivocally apologizes to this Hon'ble Court and reiterates that it
> was never the intention of the answering respondent to mislead this Hon'ble
> Court." (emphasis supplied) FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 14 of 24
20\. To this Court it appears from the above pleadings, the defendant has
clearly tried to mislead the learned Single Judge by stating that it had been
supplying the concerned product to the Army and other parties under the same
trade mark since 2005. The apologies tendered in this behalf by the defendant
are unconvincing and unsatisfactory. It may be recalled that the order dated
20th August 2007 was conditional and the learned Single Judge had
categorically observed as under:
> "It has been put to learned counsel for the defendant that in case these
> averments are found incorrect, the Court would even examine the aspect of
> interim compensatory damages while deciding the interlocutory application
> since no interim relief has been granted to the plaintiff in view of this
> stand of the defendant."
Once the said statement was found to be factually incorrect, the sequitur was
that an interim injunction should follow in favour of the plaintiff. The
conduct of the defendant in misleading the learned Single Judge into
proceeding on the footing that it had commenced supplies to the Army since
2005 should by itself have disentitled the defendant to any relief.
21\. It was contended by learned counsel for the respondent defendant that the
plaintiff had approached the Court with unclean hands and that it had
suppressed the fact that it had participated in the tenders in which the other
bidders had also participated; that the plaintiff knew that these tenders were
for „SUPER BRIGHT‟ products; that the plaintiff therefore made a FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 15 of 24 false averment that he knew of the award of the tender
to the defendant only sometime in March 2007. It was sought to be contended
that being in the same trade it would have been impossible for the plaintiff
not to know that the tender had in fact been awarded to the defendant,
particularly when the plaintiff was not awarded the tender.
22\. We are not impressed with the above submissions. It appears that the Army
in fact does not announce publicly or place in the public domain information
as to who has been awarded the contract for supply of the product. It is
plausible therefore that the aggrieved party would come to know that it has
not been awarded the tender only when supplies are made by some other party
pursuant to that tender. When the admitted position is that the defendant made
the supplies only in March 2007, it is quite possible that the plaintiff knew
of the award of the tender to the defendant only thereafter. We also do not
appreciate the submission about the plaintiff having acquiesced in the
defendant supplying the goods under the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. Till such
time the defendant in fact supplied the goods under that trade mark, the
plaintiff could not have been said to have suffered any injury on account of
the infringement.
23\. This Court is also not impressed by the distinction sought to be drawn by
the defendant between a PAC tendering process and an open tendering process.
The defendant cannot be seen to take advantage of the lapse of the FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 16 of 24 army in inviting tenders for supply of a non-generic
goods through an open tender process particularly when it is the plaintiff
alone which has been manufacturing the said product under the said mark. The
defendant cannot claim to be unaware of the legal consequences of knowingly
using the plaintiff‟s mark on similar goods and supplying them to the army.
24\. It was sought to be contended that for the purpose of an action in
passing off it would have to be shown that the person to whom the goods were
supplied would have been deceived into believing that the goods were that of
the plaintiff when in fact they were not. The case of the defendant is that
the army was under no such deception or confusion as it knew that the goods
supplied by the defendant under the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ were not
manufactured by the plaintiff. Reliance was placed on the judgments in Harrods
Ltd. v. Harrodian School Ltd. (1996) RPC 697 where certain tests have been
laid down for determining if there is deception. To underscore the distinction
between an action on passing off and an action in infringement reliance was
also placed on the decisions in Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions Pvt.
Ltd. (2004) 6 SCC 145, Bhavnesh Mohanlal Amin v. Nirma Chemicals Works Ltd.
(2006) 1 SCC 185, Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
(2001) 5 SCC 73, Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories
(1965) 1 SCR 737 and Wander Ltd. v. Antox India Pvt. Ltd. 1990 (Supp) SCC 727.
As regards the contention that the plaintiff had acquiesced in the supply by
the defendant of the „SUPER BRIGHT‟ product, reliance was FAO(OS) No. 364/2008
Page 17 of 24 placed on the decision in Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet
Machines Pvt. Ltd. (1994) 2 SCC 448 and M.Gurudas v. Rasaranjan (2006) 8 SCC
367\.
25\. On the other hand learned counsel for the appellant plaintiff emphasised
that the supply by the defendant of the detergent using the trade mark „SUPER
BRIGHT‟ was plainly dishonest and such supply would result in the dilution of
the plaintiff‟s trade mark and loss of goodwill particularly if the quality of
the product supplied by the defendant was poor. It would adversely affect the
plaintiff‟s trade mark. Reliance is placed on Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo
Kushalani 1998 PTC (18) 580 which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Baker
Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Kushalani (2004) 29 PTC 153 (SC).
26\. The law in regard to the distinction between an action for infringement
and an act for passing off is well settled. In Cadila Health Care the Supreme
Court, after referring to its earlier decisions, reiterated that "what has to
be seen in the case of a passing off action is the similarity between the
competing marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of deception or
causing confusion. It is not correct to say that the difference in essential
features is more relevant. The principle of phonetic similarity cannot be
jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words are written are
different."
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 18 of 24
27\. As far as the present case is concerned there are no two competing marks
one by the plaintiff and the other by the defendant. There is only one mark
used and that belongs to the plaintiff. Admittedly, the defendant is supplying
the product in question, using the plaintiff‟s trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. The
only defence of the defendant is that as far as the army is concerned there is
no deception and since the supplies are being made only to the army and in
strict consonance with the terms of the tender and therefore there is no cause
of action in a suit for passing off. The precise averment made by the
defendant/respondent in para 8 of its reply dated 1 st September 2008 in the
present appeal is: "...the Respondent only supplies its product to the Army
and has been using the words „Super Bright‟ in relation to its product and in
connection with the tenders invited by the Army since 2005." It is not
possible to accept the submission of the defendant that the army is under no
deception that the product supplied by the defendant is manufactured by the
plaintiff and not the defendant. Admittedly, the defendant does not
manufacture the product in question under the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. It
uses this mark for its products only when supplying to the Army. This alone
should be sufficient to negate the claim of the defendant about there being no
deception. Further, it is clear from the authorisation letter dated 4th June
2007 that what was tested by the Army authorities and cleared for supply were
only the product of the plaintiff and that "no other products were
tested/approved." Given the open tender process it is possible that the army
was under the impression that the FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 19 of 24 defendant
and other manufacturers had purchased the product of the plaintiff in the
market and were supplying it to the army. This is very much contemplated from
the questions asked of each tenderer in the open tendering process, which have
been set out earlier. The defendant in the instant case does appear to have
held out to the army that the product supplied by it is „SUPER BRIGHT‟. It is
not as if the defendant informed the Army that the product supplied by it is
not the plaintiff‟s product purchased from the market. In the circumstances,
it is not possible to accept the defendant‟s contention that the Army was not
under any confusion that the defendant is supplying its own product and not
that of the plaintiff‟s. The supply of its product by the defendant under the
mark SUPER BRIGHT without informing the army that it is not manufacturing the
said product under the mark SUPER BRIGHT is prima facie a dishonest use of the
plaintiff‟s mark. This essential feature of the case cannot be ignored and
belies the claim of the defendant about there being no deception.
28\. We also find considerable merit in the submission of the appellant about
the likely loss of goodwill and reputation by the plaintiff if the injunction
were refused. The factors to be taken into consideration for grant of
injunction in an action of passing off, as explained in Satyam Infoway Ltd.
(supra) includes the loss or likelihood of reputation. In Baker Hughes Ltd. v.
Hiroo Khushalani, 1998 (18) PTC 580 a learned Single Judge of this Court,
after noticing several judicial decisions summarised the position thus (at
page 618):
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 20 of 24
> "If the defendant is in direct competition with the plaintiff, the court
> will readily infer the likelihood of the damage to the plaintiff‟s goodwill
> not only through loss of sales but also through loss of exclusive use of his
> name or mark in relation to the particular goods or business."
A reference was made to para 5.04 of the treatrise "Pasing Off Law and
Practice" by John Drysdale and Michael Silverleaf (Second Edition, 1995,
Butterworths) which reads thus (at page 618):
> "5.04. If a defendant is in direct competition with the plaintiff, the court
> will readily infer the likelihood of damage to the plaintiff‟s goodwill, not
> merely through loss of sales but also through loss of the exclusive use of
> his name or mark in relation to the particular goods or business concerned,
> on evidence of the plaintiff‟s reputation in the goods or business and a
> relevant misrepresentation by the defendant in relation to the same or
> similar goods or the same or a similar business."
Reference was also made to the observations of Neville, J. in Warwick Tyre Co.
v. New Motor and General Rubber Co., [1910] 1 Chancery Division 248 (at page
255):
> "Practically the sole asset possessed by the plaintiff is the goodwill which
> attaches to the name of Warwick in the tyre market, and I think the evidence
> shows that the goodwill is an asset of great value. It would not be doubted
> that the value of the trade name Warwick in the tyre market would be
> considerably lessened by the fact that there was another person in the
> market who was entitled to deal in tyres in connection with the name
> Warwick. In the first place it would limit the right of the owner of the
> name Warwick in the tyre market, to the use of his name in respect of those
> articles only those actual articles on which he had used it hitherto, and in
> the second place, it puts the reputation of the plaintiffs in the hands of
> persons over whom they have no control whatever."
We are informed that although a Division Bench of this Court had reversed
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 21 of 24 the above judgment of the learned Single
Judge, the Supreme Court in Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Kushalani 2004 (29)
PTC 153 (SC) affirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge by setting
aside the judgment of the Division Bench. We are in complete agreement with
the exposition of the law by the learned Single Judge and are of the view that
it would apply on all fours in the instant case.
29\. Admittedly, the appellants have been using the mark in question earlier
than the defendant. The balance of convenience in granting the injunction is
clearly therefore in favour of the Appellant. The observations of the Supreme
Court in N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation 1996 (16) PTC 583 and Milment
Oftho Industries v. Allergan Inc. 2004 (28) PTC 585 (SC) as to the equities
weighing in favour of the prior user are equally relevant in the present
context.
30\. The law being sufficiently clear, this Court is of the view that the
Appellants have demonstrated that not only they have a prima facie case but
that the balance of convenience in granting the interim injunction as prayed
for is entirely in their favour.
31\. We are not impressed with the submission of the Defendant Respondent that
the plaintiff should be denied an injunction on the grounds of delay and
acquiescence. The decision Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt.
Ltd. in fact does not support the defendant. On the facts of FAO(OS) No.
364/2008 Page 22 of 24 the said case the Supreme Court held that there was
nothing on record to show that the first Defendant in that case was an earlier
manufacturer and that "there can be only one mark, one source, and one
proprietor. It cannot have two origins." On the materials placed on record in
the said case it was held that "the denial of injunction, once the
infringement of trade mark, copyright and design is established, cannot be
supported." Reverting to the case on hand, for the reasons already explained,
in the present case we are satisfied that the plaintiffs have been able to
show prima facie that they are the prior users of the mark and that they have
made out a prima facie case for grant of an ad interim injunction in their
favour.
32\. Accordingly the impugned order of the learned Single Judge is set aside.
There will be injunction in favour of the plaintiff appellant restraining the
respondent defendant from manufacturing or authorising the manufacture,
selling or offering for sale, marketing, advertising, promoting, displaying or
in any other manner whatsoever using the trade mark SUPER BRIGHT and/or SUPER
BRIGHT EL and/or SUPER BRIGHT EL-C and/or SUPER BRIGHT EL 81and/or SUPER
BRIGHT HD ULTRA and/or SUPER BRIGHT Bleach and/or any other trade mark which
is deceptively or confusingly similar to the above trade marks. The injunction
will operate prospectively subject to the condition that the defendant will
maintain complete accounts of all the sales made by it of the products sold to
the army or any other persons till the date of the present order. The
injunction will continue till the disposal of the Suit. We are informed that
FAO(OS) No. 364/2008 Page 23 of 24 the Army authorities have since desisted
from inviting tenders for supply of SUPER BRIGHT products through the open
tender process. In any event, the law as explained in this judgment will
continue to govern future similar tenders.
33\. The observations in this judgment are for the purposes of determining the
case for grant of injunction pending the final disposal of the suit. The final
determination of the issues in the suit will be arrived at on an independent
assessment of the evidence uninfluenced by this judgment.
34\. The appeal is allowed with costs of Rs.20,000/- which will be paid by the
Respondent to the Appellant within a period of four weeks.
