1\. The two accused Amit Kumar and Rajeev Kumar were sent up for trial in this
case for the offences u/s 63/68­A Copyright Act, 1957 as also for the offence
u/s 292 IPC. Both the accused are real brothers.
2\. It is the case of prosecution that on 19­06­2007 SI Amit Issar, who was
posted in IPR Section, EOW, Crime Branch, New Delhi, received a secret
information that in shop no. 8­A/155, Gulab Bagh, Uttam Nagar, Delhi
infringement of VCDs/CDs and DVDs were being committed. Accordingly, a raiding
party comprising of said SI, HC Devender Kumar, HC Leela Dhar, was organized
under the supervision of Inspector Raj Kishore and a raid was conducted at the
shop where accused Amit was found physically present sitting on the sale
counter of the shop. In the shop various CDs/DVDs of English/Hindi movies and
songs and pornographic DVD/VCD were displayed for sale/letting/hire and on
checking a total of 776 DVDs of various Hindi movies; 411 DVDs of various
English movies; 1220 VCDs of various Hindi films and songs; 900 MP3 audio CDs
and 174 pornographic DVDs/VCDs were recovered. These articles were not
containing mandatory particulars as required u/s 52­A of Copyright Act.
Accordingly, case was registered and accused Amit was arrested. During
investigation, it was learnt that accused Rajeev, brother of accused Amit, had
obtained this premises on rent where the shop in question was being run and
infringement was committed by both of them.
3\. Accordingly, charges u/s 63/68­A Copyright Act, 1957 and section 292 IPC
were framed against both the accused to which both accused claimed trial.
4\. To prove its case, prosecution examined six witnesses namely PW1 Inspector
Amit Issar, PW2 HC Ranbir Singh, PW3 Vivek Kumar, PW4 HC Leela Dhar, PW5
Devender Kapoor and PW6 SI Suresh Kumar.
5\. The defence of the accused was of total denial and, when incriminating
evidence was put to both the accused u/s 313/281 Cr. P. C., they denied that
any such recovery was effected from them. Both the accused claimed that they
have been JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act &
292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 2 of 18 falsely implicated and the case
property was planted upon them as on 19­06­2007 the police party brought the
case property from an adjacent shop and planted the same on them. Both accused
claimed that in the shop in question they deal in sale/purchase of mobile and
recharge coupons etc but not in CDs/VCDs. Both of them admitted that shop in
question was taken on rent from its landlord and on the date of alleged
recovery the shop was under the tenancy of accused Rajeev. Accused did not opt
to lead any defence evidence in their favour.
6\. I have heard Ld. APP for State and counsel for two accused.
7\. Ld. Counsel for two accused argued that case of the prosecution is not
proved since there is no complainant in this case and the case was registered
on the complaint of a police official on the basis of secret information only.
It is also argued that no decoy customer was sent to the shop in order to find
out whether DVDs etc were meant for sale or not , nor there is evidence that
any customer was present purchasing the articles. It is also argued that in
the rent receipt, allegedly proved on record, no shop no. is mentioned;
Inspector Raj Kishore has not been examined; no public witness was joined in
the raid and even the alleged Panwala, whose shop was adjacent, was not joined
; the VCDs/DVDs were sent to FSL; no DD entry of departure/arrival of police
is proved; scooter number/vehicle number on which the raiding party traveled
to the spot, is not proved; contents of CDs were not checked by the
investigating agency. It is lastly argued that there are contradictions in the
testimony of witnesses regarding time of preparation of rukka; sending the
rukka; arrival of IO etc. It is thus argued that both accused deserve
acquittal as the case of the prosecution is not proved.
8\. PW2 HC Ranbir Singh was a formal witness who registered FIR on 19­06­ 2007
and his testimony is not of much importance to the case of prosecution. PW3
Vivek Kumar was the landlord, who deposed that he is the owner of the shop in
question and he had let out the shop to accused Rajeev Kumar from April 2007
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 3 of 18 onwards and accused Rajeev Kumar took
the shop for running a music shop. Emphasis is supplied on this part of the
testimony of this witness who specifically deposed that shop in question was
taken on rent by accused Rajeev for a music shop and not for mobile/recharge
coupons etc. This witness also deposed that he gave rent receipt and rent
agreement to the police which is Ex. PW3/A and mark B, C and D. Nothing
material could be brought on record from the cross­examination of this
witness. All that was suggested to this witness by the accused is, that in the
rent agreement shop no. 8A is not mentioned nor it was mentioned in the rent
receipt. Besides this, not even a single suggestion was given to this witness
that shop was not obtained for music shop or that shop was obtained for mobile
sale/purchase or repair. It was not suggested to the witness that on the date
of alleged recovery, the accused were not running the music shop or were
running shop of mobile sale/purchase. This fact coupled with the admission of
two accused in their statement that shop in question was obtained on tenancy
by accused Rajeev clearly proves that on 19­06­2007 the shop was in occupation
of accused Rajeev as a tenant and mere contradiction in the number of shop in
the testimony of witness or absence of the same in the rent agreement/rent
receipt does not help the accused at all.
9\. PW1 Inspector Amit Issar and PW4 HC Leela Dhar both are recovery witnesses
who deposed that on 19­06­2007 a raid was conducted in the shop in question
where accused Amit was present and in the shop DVDs/VCDs of English/Hindi
movies; Hindi songs MP3 audio CDs, DVDs/VCDs of pornographic films were
displayed and recovered. It is also deposed that those articles were not
containing mandatory particulars as required u/s 52­A of Copyright Act, 1957.
The case property was identified by both the witnesses in the court very
clearly as the same which was recovered on that day from the possession of
accused Amit, who was physically present in the shop. Accused Amit was also
specifically identified by both of them in the court as the person who was
present inside the shop. The quantity JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO.
500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 4 of 18 of
recovery was also correctly specified by both the witnesses and the case
property was proved as Ex. P1 to P6. Nothing material could be brought out on
record in the cross­examination of these witnesses also except some minor
contradictions regarding the vehicle used for travel to the place of recovery;
time of sending of rukka, time of arrival of second IO etc. But all those
contradictions are very trivial in nature and does not affect the
trustworthiness of any of these two witnesses.
10\. PW6 SI Suresh Kumar was the Second IO who reached the place of occurrence
when he got information from PW1 and he deposed that when he reached the place
of recovery, the case property was already sealed in six gunny bags and
accused Amit Kumar along with case property was handed over to him with a
carbon copy of rukka and FIR. Thereafter, he prepared site plan Ex. PW6/A and
he seized the rent documents from the owner of premises and later on accused
Rajeev was arrested. The witness proved the rukka, seizure memo, arrest memo
and personal search memo etc. In the cross­examination of PW6, nothing
material could be brought out on record except some minor contradictions as
mentioned above.
11\. PW5 Devender Kapoor proved the assignment deeds of movies 'Shootout at
Lokhandwala' and 'Sarhad Paar' as Ex. PW5/A and B. It is the case of
prosecution that from the recovered DVDs/VCDs, infringed DVDs/VCDs of these
movies were also recovered from the two accused. Perusal of the assignment
deeds Ex. PW5/A and B show that producer of these movies have assigned the
copyright of these cinematographic films in favour of M/s Super Cassettes
Industries Ltd.
12\. The arguments of Ld. Counsel for accused that there was no complainant in
the matter and therefore the case could not have been investigated is without
any force. The offences u/s 63 and 68­A Copyright Act are both cognizable
offences and, in a cognizable offence there is no legal requirement that
police cannot investigate without proper complaint or without orders of the
court. A police officer who receives information regarding commission of a
cognizable offence can investigate the matter JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit
Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 5
of 18 directly. In the present case, the secret information which was received
by police was regarding infringement of cinematographic films and audio CDs
and information was not regarding infringement of any particular copyright
owner. In such circumstances, this argument is absolutely without any force.
13\. The next contention raised is that there is no decoy customer sent to the
shop or that there was no customer present in the shop therefore there is no
material with the prosecution that articles were meant for sale, is also
without any force. Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957 defines as to what is
infringement and when copyright is deemed to be infringed. It provides that
copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed when any person makes for
sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade displays or offers
for sale or hire any infringing copies of the work, copyright shall be deemed
to be infringed. Therefore under clause (b) of section 51 of Copyright Act,
1957, mere displaying by way of trade or offering for sale or hiring
infringing copies is deemed to be infringement. In the present case, it is
specifically deposed by the prosecution witnesses that DVDs/VCDs were
displayed for sale in the shop. Even otherwise, there is no justification by
the accused regarding possession of such huge quantity of DVDs/VCDs of various
English/Hindi movies and songs. Recovery of such huge quantity of these
articles gives rise to a legitimate presumption that it were meant for sale/
hire and nothing else. In all probability, these articles were meant for
sale/hire only and nothing else. Therefore there is deemed infringement u/s 51
of the Act.
14\. It is next argued that Inspector Raj Kishore is not examined in this
case. This arguments is also without force as it is not the quantity of
evidence which matters in a criminal case but it is the quality of evidence
which matters. What is to be seen is whether the witness examined by
prosecution were trustworthy and not the number of witnesses are to be
counted.
15\. Section 134 of the Indian Evidence Act clearly provides that no
particular number of witnesses in any case be required for the proof of any
fact. This shows that JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A
CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 6 of 18 conviction can be based on
solitary witness which is trust worthy and what matters is quality.
In AIR 2005 SUPREME COURT 2503 Seeman alias Veeranam, Vs. State by Inspector
of Police, It was observed in Para 4 "It is now well settled that the evidence
of witness cannot be discarded merely on the ground that he is a related
witness or the sole witness, or both, if otherwise the same is found credible.
The witness could be a relative but that does not mean to reject his statement
in totality. In such a case, it is the paramount duty of the court to be more
careful in the matter of scrutiny of evidence of the interested witness, and
if, on such scrutiny it is found that the evidence on record of such
interested sole witness is worth credence, the same would not be discarded
merely on the ground that the witness is an interested witness. Caution is to
be applied by the court while scrutinizing the evidence of the interested sole
witness. The prosecution's non­production of one independent witness who has
been named in the FIR by itself cannot be taken to be a circumstance to
discredit the evidence of the interested witness and disbelieve the
prosecution case. It is well settled that it is the quality of the evidence
and not the quantity of the evidence which is required to be judged by the
court to place credence on the statement."
Similarly in the case of State of U.P.
vs. Anil Singh AIR 1988 Sc 1998 it was held that in some cases the entire
prosecution case is doubted for not examining all witnesses to the occurrence.
We have recently pointed out to the indifferent attitude of the public in the
investigation of crimes. The public are generally reluctant to come forward to
depose before the Court. It is, therefore, not correct to reject the
prosecution version only on the ground that all witnesses to the occurrence
have not been examined. Nor it is proper to reject the case for want of
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 7 of 18 corroboration by independent witnesses
if the case made out is otherwise true and acceptable.
In the case of Dr Krishna Pal and another vs. State of U. P.1996 (7) SCC 194
non examination of eyewitnesses was held to be not a ground to discard the
convincing and reliable evidence produced in the case.
16\. It is next argued that no public witness has been joined. It is a matter
of common knowledge that public persons are reluctant to become witnesses of
criminal trial. It has been held in a number of judgments by Hon'ble Supreme
court and High Courts that merely because public witnesses are not joined in a
case, prosecution case cannot be thrown out.
17\. Hon'ble Supreme court in the case Ambika Prasad & anr vs. State 2002 (2)
CRIMES 63 (SC) held that it is known fact that independent persons are
reluctant to be a witness or to assist the investigation. Reasons are not far
to seek. Firstly, in cases where injured witnesses of the close relative of
the deceased are under constant threat and they dare not depose the truth
before the Court, independent witnesses believe that their safety is not
guaranteed. That belief cannot be said to be without any substance. Other
reason may be the delay in recording the evidence of independent witnesses and
repeated adjournments in the Court. In any case if independent persons are not
willing to cooperate with the investigation, prosecution cannot be blamed at
and it cannot be a ground for rejecting the evidence of injured witnesses. It
was also held that non examination of investigating officer of the case is no
ground to discard the evidence of eye witnesses. Similarly in the case of
State of U.P. vs. Anil Singh AIR 1988 Sc 1998 ; Dr Krishna Pal and another vs.
State of U. P.1996 (7) SCC 194 and in the case of Appabhai Vs. State Of Gujrat
AIR 1988 SC 696 it was held that These days people in the vicinity where the
incident took place avoid to come forward to give evidence and civilized
people are in­ JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act
& 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 8 of 18 sensitive when crime is committed
even in their presence and they withdraw both from the victim and vigilante.
18\. Law is not that testimony of police officers is absolutely untrustworthy
or that it can never be acted upon. Rather, the law is that even the testimony
of a police officer can be acted upon and a conviction can be based on such
testimony if the testimony is unimpeached and found to be trustworthy.
19\. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anil @ Andya Sadashiv Nandorkar Vs. State J. T.
1996 (3) SC 120 has held that testimony of the police officials cannot be
discredited merely because they are police officials if otherwise, their
testimony is found to be cogent, trustworthy and reliable. Further, Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Akmal Ahmad Vs. State of Delhi J. T 1999 (2) SC 388 held that
''it is now well settled that evidence of search and seizure made by police
will not become vitiated only for the reasons that the evidence is not
supported by independent witnesses.''
20\. In the present case, I have already mentioned above that there is nothing
on record to suggest untrustworthiness of the police official witnesses.
Although the two accused persons in their statements claimed that they are
innocent and that case property was planted upon them by the police after
bringing the same from an adjacent shop but the defence taken by the two
accused does not inspire any confidence whatsoever. It would be anybody guess
as to why police officials would do this. If the accused want this court to
believe that they have been implicated falsely, the least which was expected
from the accused was to at least come out as to what could have been the
motive for the police for their false implication and as to what was that
reason for which police official could have done so. But no such reason is
even mentioned. The accused cannot expect this court to believe their version
by simple bare allegation that they have been falsely implicated. At least
some reason should have been put forth by the accused to suggest as to what
could have been motive of the police in implicating them. In the absence of
this, I do not find any reason to throw JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO.
500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 9 of 18 out the
testimony of police officials.
21\. The other contention raised by counsel for accused is that there are
contradictions in the testimony of witnesses regarding time of preparation of
rukka, sending of rukka, arrival of Second IO etc and also non­mentioning of
the vehicle number. In my considered view, again these contradictions are very
trivial in nature and does not affect merits of the case at all. Such trivial
contradictions are bound to occur in the testimony of witnesses. In the
present case, the evidence is recorded after about 2 years from the date of
recovery and such minor contradictions were bound to occur. These minor
contradictions cannot be given any undue weightage.
22\. In my considered view none of the contradictions as appearing in the
statement of the witnesses and as pointed out are material enough to create
doubt about the truthfulness of the case of the prosecution. It may be
mentioned here that the accused took up a defence that he has been falsely
implicated in the present case but no cogent reason for false implication has
been shown. Whenever an accused takes up a plea that he has been falsely
implicated the first question which arises is as to what was the ground for
false implication. This question in the present case has not been answered. It
may be mentioned that for any false implication there has to be some or the
other motive which is in the best knowledge of the accused and the onus to
tell the motive of false implication is on the accused which could not be
discharged in the present case. Simply by alleging that we have been falsely
implicated ­falsely implicated would not be sufficient to create doubt about
the case of the prosecution. The accused does not have any kind of enmity with
any of the prosecution witnesses therefore there is no question of his false
implication. The nature of contradictions pointed out in the present case are
minor and are infact simple errors of observation which occurs in human
nature. The testimony of the witnesses are otherwise corroborating each other
in all necessary material particulars. Simply because there occurs some minor
variations in their powers of observation and retention would not
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 10 of 18 make the case of the prosecution
unbelievable.
                                              Yadav     & ors. Vs State of Bihar (2001) 8 SCC 86  it  
                    In the case of Sukhdev
was held by Hon Supreme Court that that once the trustworthiness of evidence
stated in a case stands satisfied, the court should not hesitate in accepting
the same . If the evidence in its entirety appears to be trustworthy, it
cannot be discarded merely on the ground of presence of minor variations in
evidence. Relying upon an earlier decision in Leela Ram vs. State of Haryana
(1999) 9 SCC 525 it was observed that there are bound to be some discrepancies
between the narrations of different witnesses when they speak on details, and
unless the contradictions are of a material dimension, the same should not be
used to jettison the evidence in its entirety. Incidentally, corroboration of
evidence with mathematical niceties cannot be expected in criminal cases.
Minor embellishments, there may be, but variations by reason therefore should
not render the evidence of eyewitnesses unbelievable. Trivial discrepancies
ought not to obliterate an otherwise acceptable evidence.
(1999) 8 SCC 649 it Relying upon an earlier decision in Ramani vs. State of
M.P. was also observed that when an eye witness is examined at length it is
quite possible for him to make some discrepancies. No true witness can
possibly escape from making some discrepant details. Perhaps an untrue witness
who is well tutored can successfully make his testimony totally
non­discrepant. But courts should bear in mind that it is only when
discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with the
credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning his
evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling in
the narration of an incident either as between the evidence of two witnesses
or as between two statements of the same witnesses is an unrealistic approach
for judicial scrutiny. It was also held that it is a common practice in trial
courts to make out contradictions JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO.
500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 11 of 18 from
the previous statement of a witness for confronting him during cross­
examination. Merely because there is inconsistency in evidence it is not
sufficient to impair the credit of the witness. No doubt section 155 of the
Evidence Act provides scope for impeachment the credit of a witness by proof
of an inconsistent former statement. But a reading of the section would
indicate that all inconsistent statements are not sufficient to impeach the
credit of the witness.
In Krishna Mochi and Others Vs. State of Bihar, (2002) 6 SCC 81, it was held
that it is the quality of evidence that matters and not the number of
witnesses. It was further held that credible evidence of even a solitary
witness can form the basis of conviction. That contradictions,
inconsistencies, exaggerations or embellishments are inevitable. It was
further held that a discrepancy existing in a prosecution case should not
weigh with the Court so long it does not materially affect the case. It was
further held that the duty of the Court is not only to see that no innocent
man should be punished but also to ensure that no person committing an offence
should get scot­ free. It was also held that even if a major portion of
evidence is found to be deficient, in case residue is sufficient to prove the
guilt of an accused, notwithstanding acquittal of number of other co­accused
persons, his conviction could be maintained.
It is now well settled that the principal 'falsus in uno falsus in omnibus'
does not apply to criminal trials and it is the duty of the court to disengage
the truth from the falsehood, to sift the grain from the chaff. Instead of
rejecting the evidence in its entirety merely on the basis of few infirmities
and merely because in one respect it is unsafe to rely on the testimony of a
witness it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be
discarded in all other respects also. A person, whose evidence is false or
evasive in part, of the case, may be perfectly reliable in another part.
Reliance is placed upon the case of Kesho Ram vs. State AIR 1978 Supreme Court
1096 ; Sukhdev Yadav & ors. Vs. State of Bihar (2001) 8 SCC86.
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 12 of 18 In the case of Shakila Abdul Gafar khan
vs. Vasant Raghunath Dhoble 2003 (3) JCC 1586 it was held the doctrine of
falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is a dangerous one especially in India for if
a whole body of the testimony were to be rejected, because witness was
evidently speaking the untruth in some aspect, it is to be feared that
administration of criminal Justice would, come to a dead stop. Witnesses just
cannot help in giving embroidery to a story, however, true in the main.
Therefore, it as to be apprised in each case as to what extent the evidence is
worthy of acceptance, and merely because in some respects the Court considers
the same to be insufficient for placing Reliance on the testimony of a
witness, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be
disregarded in all respects as well. The evidence is to be sifted with care.
The aforesaid term is not a sound rule for the reason that one hardly comes
across a witness whose evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any
rate exaggerations, embroideries or embellishment. It was also held that
normal discrepancies in evidence are those which are due to normal errors of
observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental
disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence and those are
always there however honest and truthful a witness may be. Material
discrepancies are those which are not normal, and not expected of a normal
person. Courts have to label the category to which a discrepancy may be
categorised. While normal discrepancies do not corrode the credibility of a
party's case, material discrepancies do so. To the same affect our judgments
in the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Kalki and another AIR 1981 SC 1390;
Krishna Mochi and others vs. State of Bihar JT 2002 (4) SC 186; Gangadhar
Bahera and others vs. State of Orissa 2002 (7) Supreme 276; Rizan and another
vs. State of Chhattisgarh 2003 (2) SCC 661.
23\. The next contention is that DD entry of the police officials regarding
their JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 13 of 18 departure/arrival is not proved is also
without any force. In the statement of accused, there is admission of two
accused that police officials came to their shop on 16­09­ 2007\. The defence
of the accused is of false implication by the police by planting the case
property by bringing it from another shop and not that the police officials
never came to their shop. Mere non­proving the DD entry does not entitle the
two accused to claim that case of prosecution should be thrown out.
24\. The last contention that case property was not sent to FSL for
examination is also without force. The case property was proved in the court
physically. The case property was not containing mandatory particulars as
required u/s 52­A of Copyright Act, 1057. Some of the DVDs/VCDs were played
and they were found to be of movies, songs and pornographic video clippings.
Section 52­A Copyright Act, 1957 provides that no person shall publish a sound
recording unless it contains the particulars viz. name and address of person
who has made the sound recording; name and address of the owner of the
copyright in such work; and year of its first publication. Similarly,
sub­section (2) of section 52­A provides that no person shall publish a video
film in respect of any work without particulars viz. certificate for
exhibition under Cinematograph Act 1952; certificate granted by Board of Film
Certification; name and address of the person who has made the video film and
declaration that he has obtained necessary license or consent from the owner
of the copyright in such work for making said video film and name and address
of the owner of copyright in such work. The recovered articles were not
containing any of these particulars therefore Section 52­A Copyright Act is
breached which is punishable u/s 68­A Copyright Act, 1957.
25\. It is already mentioned above that there is an infringement of copyright
committed by the accused u/s 51 of the Act which is punishable u/s 63 of the
Act. It may be mentioned here that in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh Vs.
Nagoti Venkataramana IV(1996) CCR 42 (SC) the following observations were made
by JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 14 of 18 Hon'ble Supreme Court:­ ownership by
the author of the pirated articles are not required for the purpose of trial
for offence u/s 68A Copyright Act.
26\. The prosecution has proved few copyright of few movies and the infringed
copies of the same were recovered from the possession of the accused without
any authority or assignment of the copyright in favour of the two accused. It
may also be mentioned that registration of copyright is not mandatory under
the provisions of the said Act..
27\. Lastly, there are DVDs/VCDs recovered from the possession of accused
which were containing obscene material i.e. nude sexual video clippings which
are obscene in nature and therefore section 292 of IPC also clearly gets
attracted since the accused had publicly exhibited/displayed for sale/hire
these DVDs/VCDs containing obscene material.
28\. Accused Amit was physically present at the shop when recovery was
effected and he was sitting at the sale counter. Accused Rajeev is the person
who was occupying the shop on tenancy and both the brothers were running the
shop. Accordingly, both the accused are guilty for the offence u/s 63 and 68­A
of Copyright Act, 1957 as well as Section 292 IPC. Both the accused are
convicted accordingly. ANNOUNCED IN OPEN COURT ON 05th May 2009 (DIGVINAY

AMIT KUMAR & Anr FIR NO. 500/07 U/s. 63/68­A Copyright Act & 292 IPC P.S.
Uttam Nagar (IPR) ORDER ON SENTENCE Pre: Ld. Sub. APP for State Ms. Suchitra
Singh Chauhan.
Both convicts Amit Kumar and Rajeev Kumar both s/o Phool Chand are present on
bail with counsel Sh. N. S. Malik, Adv.
Both convicts have been found and held guilty for the offence u/s 63/68­A
Copyright Act, 1957 and u/s 292 IPC vide judgement of this Court dated
05­05­2009.
Arguments on sentence heard. Ld. Counsel for convicts requests for a lenient
view on the ground that both convicts are of young age and convict Amit is
also a student and they have family to support. It is also stated that there
is no previous involvement of the two convicts in any other offence
whatsoever.
Section 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 provides minimum sentence of a term of six
months and minimum fine of Rs. 50,000/­ and the maximum sentence provided is
upto three years with maximum fine of Rs. Two lakhs in a case where the
offender is first time offender. Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of G.
Buttan Vs. State & Anr 2007 (34) PTC 636 (Delhi) observed in paragraph no. 9
as follows:
"More than two decades have gone by when the amendment in the penal provisions
was brought about. There is a sea change in crime situation since then. As
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR NO. 500/07/U.S.63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/05.05.2009/Page 16 of 18 the experience would show the extent of
punishment provided by the Amendment Act 65 of 1984 has failed to yield
desired result. The view of piracy instead of showing any decline keeps
registering a spiralling rise in crime graph. Such a trend is indicative of a
crying need for a much more stringent and deterrent legislative measures.
Viewed in this perspective extent of punishment provided for the offenes which
the petitioner is alleged to have committed cannot be the only indicator
factor to find the gravity of the offences complained of. Such like acts of
piracy as alleged in the case on hand, if not effectively curbed rather
allowed to thrive, will pose a serious threat to very survival of the whole
film industry apart from having a cascading effect on revenue thereby
impacting the national interest in the ultimate. Such acts of piracy
constitute a class apart and must be distinguished from acts of piracy in
relation to isolation individual ownership in copyright."
In those cases in which minimum sentence is provided, this Court cannot award
a lesser sentence than the minimum sentence provided by the statute. Keeping
in view the young age of two convicts with no previous involvement and the
fact that they are bred­ winners of the family, in my considered view a
lenient view be taken but it cannot be lesser than the minimum sentence
provided by the statute. In such circumstance, both convicts are sentenced to
simple imprisonment for a period of six months each and fine of Rs. 50,000/­
each for the offence u/s 63 Copyright Act, 1957. In default of payment of
fine, further SI for 45 days each.
For the offence u/s 68­A Copyright Act, 1957, in view of the facts and
circumstances, a sentence of simple imprisonment of two months and fine of Rs.
5,000/­ each is imposed. In default of payment of fine, further SI for 15 days
each.
U/s 292 IPC both convicts are sentenced to simple imprisonment for a period of
one month and fine of Rs. 1,000/­ each. In default of payment of fine, further
SI for 7 days each. All the three sentences qua both the convicts shall run
concurrently. Earlier Bail bonds/Surety Bonds of both the convicts are
cancelled. Both convicts are ordered to be JUDGMENT/State Vs. Amit Kumar/FIR
