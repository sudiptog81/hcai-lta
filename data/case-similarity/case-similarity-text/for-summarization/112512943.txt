           Present:      Mr.Pravin Anand, Ms.Archana Shankar, Mr.Devinder
           Rawat, Mr.Nishchal Anand and Mr.Sanchith Shivakumar, Advs. for
           the plaintiffs.
Section 64 (1) (a), 64(1)(d), 64(1)(f) and 64 (1)(k) of the Patent Act. The
issues raised render the suit patents vulnerable to challenge.
84\. In view of the aforementioned reasons, I am of the view that the
plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie case. The balance of
convenience is also in favour of the defendant. This is especially so as the
original patent in question IN 229 has already expired on 14.07.2018.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 56 of 57
Further, the drugs being sold by the defendants are substantially at a lower
price.
85\. Hence, I vacate the interim order passed by this court on different
dates. The defendants will however continue to maintain correct and true
accounts regarding the sale of the impugned drugs which are sold or dealt by
them in any manner. They will also file quarterly accounts in this court
supported by the affidavit of one of its directors affirming the veracity of
the account. The defendant will also file account statements of sale figures
of the said drug duly authenticated by the chartered accountant of the
           the plaintiffs.

1\. These are three suits filed by the plaintiffs seeking a decree of
permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from marketing, selling,
distributing, etc. any product that infringes the subject matter of Indian
Patent Nos. IN 209907 (hereinafter referred to as ―IN 907‖, i.e. the Species
Patent), IN 247984 (hereinafter referred to as ―IN 984‖, i.e. the Polymorph
Patent) and IN 272674 (hereinafter referred to as ―IN 674‖, i.e. the
Formulation Patent).
2\. By the present judgment, I will deal with the injunction applications
filed by the plaintiffs being IA No. 3986/2018 filed in CS(COMM) 749/2018, IA
No.4771/2018 filed in CS(COMM) 792/2018, IA No.9332/2018 filed in CS(COMM)
1023/2018 and IA 5096/2018 filed in CS(Comm.) 749/2018 by the defendants under
Order 39 Rule 4 CPC seeking vacation of the interim orders.
3\. The injunction applications are filed under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC
seeking an injunction to restrain the defendants from selling, marketing or
dealing with TICAGRELOR or any product which is in violation of the registered
patent of the plaintiff's company IN 907, IN 984 and IN 674.
4\. CS(COMM) 749/2018 came up for hearing on 22.03.2018 when in IA No.
3986/2018 this court passed an interim order in favour of the plaintiffs
restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or dealing with TICAGRELOR
tablet or any drug which is in violation of the registered patents of the
plaintiffs being IN 907, IN 984, and IN 674. On 23.04.2018 a similar interim
order was passed in IA No.4771/2018 in CS(COMM) 792/2018. This court had then
noted that when the written statement was filed a stand had been taken by the
defendants that they had not launched the CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 2 of
57 drug in question. However, this court on 23.04.2018 noted that while the
matter was pending in court, the defendant had launched the drug. In CS(COMM)
1023/2008, a similar interim order was passed on 18.07.2018 in IA No.
9332/2018.
5\. The case of the plaintiff is that the drug TICAGRELOR falls within the
scope of Indian Patent No.907 and 984. The finished formulation of TICAGRELOR
is said to be covered within the scope of IN 674. The said compound TICAGRELOR
is said to have proved to be an effective platelet aggregation inhibitor. The
said TICAGRELOR is the INN (international non- proprietary name) assigned to
the molecule having the IUPAC name
(1S,2S,3R,5S)-3-[7-[(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-Difluorophenyl) cyclopropylamino] 5-
(propylthio)-3H-[l,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-5-(2-hydroxyethoxy)
cyclopentane-l,2-diol. The empirical formula of TICAGRELOR is C23H28F2N6O4S
and its molecular weight is 522.57. TICAGRELOR has the following structural
formula:
7\. Claim 1 of IN '907 discloses a class of compounds with the following
Markush formula:
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 3 of 57
6\. TICAGRELOR is said to fall within the scope of claim 1 wherein R is
OCH2CH2OH1, R' is propyl, R2 is phenyl group substituted by two fluorine
atoms, R3 and R4 are hydroxyl groups. Further, TICAGRELOR is specifically
claimed as the third compound in Claim 5 of the said patent. The process for
making TICAGRELOR has also been specifically disclosed in example 3 of IN
'907.
7\. The Indian Patent No.907 is said to be a valid and subsisting patent which
has remained unchallenged even though it was published way back in the year
2005. It was not subjected to any pre-grant or post-grant opposition under
sections 25(1) and 25(2) of the Patents Act, 1970. However, in 2015 Micro Labs
Limited i.e. defendant No.2 in CS(COMM) 749/2018 filed a petition for
revocation of the said patent which is said to be pending before the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board.
8\. The plaintiff has also made reference to two other patents including
Indian Patent No.984(polymorph patent) which is said to be a Crystalline form
of A Triazolo (4.5-D) Pyrimidine Compound. It is stated that four Crystalline
forms of TICAGRELOR are disclosed in patent No. IN 984.
The said patent is said to be a subsisting patent.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 4 of 57
Similarly, reference is made to Indian Patent No.674(formulation patent) which
relates to a pharmaceutical composition of TICAGRELOR. It is said to be
disclosed in claims 1-10 of IN 674.
It is pleaded that by virtue of section 48 of the Patents Act, the plaintiffs
have exclusive rights to prevent others from making, using, selling, offering
for sale or importing TICAGRELOR as well as its crystalline form (IN ‗984) and
its finished formulation (as claimed in IN'674) or any other product that
falls within the scope of the claims of IN'907 and the above two noted
patents.
9\. TICAGRELOR is said to be an antiplatelet drug prescribed to patients who
have suffered a recent heart attack or unstable angina (chest pain) for
reducing the chances of a thrombotic events such as a heart attack or a
stroke. It is stated that before the introduction of TICAGRELOR, despite the
widespread adoption of intensive monitoring and prompt treatment with existing
medications, approximately 1 in 3 ACS patients died or had a repeat myocardial
infraction, or required re-hospitalisation within six months. TICAGRELOR works
by preventing the formation of new blood clots, thus maintaining blood flow in
the body to help reduce the risk of another cardiovascular event.
10\. It is stated that TICAGRELOR was first approved in the USA in 2011 and is
marketed under the trademark BRILINTA. It has been approved in more than 100
countries. In India the plaintiff received drug regulatory approval in May
2012 and was commercially launched in India in October 2012 under the same
trademark BRILINTA. The price of a tablet is said to be Rs.50/-.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 5 of 57
11\. In CS(COMM) 749/2018 where defendant No.2 is Micro Labs Ltd, the
plaintiff states that in the month of March 2018 plaintiff received business
information through credible market sources that the defendants are planning
to launch a generic version of TICAGRELOR under the probable name BIGRELOR in
the first week of April 2018. It was also learnt that the defendants have
printed their packaging for their generic product and their representatives
are speaking with doctors about the same. It is stated that the defendants
have filed revocation petition in respect of trademark IN 984 and IN 907
before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB). It was pleaded that
the acts of the defendant would cause immense damage to the plaintiff's
business and public interest which cannot be accounted for in monetary terms.
It would also be in blatant disregard of the plaintiff's intellectual property
rights. Hence, the suit.
12\. In CS(COMM) 792/2018, where defendant No.2 is Natco Pharma Ltd., the
plaintiff has been pleaded that in the first week of April 2018, the
plaintiffs received business information regarding the plan of the defendants
to launch a generic version of TICAGRELOR in the third week of April 2018\. It
has also been stated that the defendants have uploaded their product list on
the website where TICAGRELOR has been listed under the category of ‗APIs-Under
Development‖. It has also been pleaded that to the plaintiffs' best knowledge,
the defendants have not yet commercially launched/marketed TICAGRELOR but
based on the background facts and credible business intelligence, the
defendants' imminent launch of the product TICAGRELOR has been received by the
plaintiffs. It has also been pleaded that the defendants are known habitual
offenders. Hence, the present suit was filed against the said defendants.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 6 of 57
13\. In CS(COMM) 1023/2018, where the defendant is Dr.Reddy's Laboratories
Ltd. the plaintiff has pleaded that in April 2018, plaintiff No.2 received
certain caveats filed by the defendant which were vague and unambiguous. On
17.07.2018, it is stated that the plaintiffs received business information
that the defendant is planning to launch a generic version of TICAGRELOR under
the brand name TICAFLO. In fact, it is pleaded, the defendant has taken steps
to introduce and offer the same for sale to its business partners and C&F
Agents. The defendant has also obtained a manufacturing license for TICAGRELOR
and is ready for a full commercial launch of the product. Hence, the present
suit filed against the said defendant.
14\. The defendants have filed their respective written statement to submit
that the suit has no merit. Most of the submissions raised by the defendant
are common. I may note some of salient submissions made which are relevant for
disposal of these applications.
15\. In CS (COMM) 749/2018 (defendant No.2 here is Micro Labs Ltd.) the
defendant has broadly pleaded in the written statement as follows:
(i) that the pharmaceutical formulation containing TICAGRELOR is purportedly
sold in India by the plaintiffs under the name BRILINTA and AXCER. It is
stated that it is the own admission of the plaintiff that the formulation is
not manufactured in India but is apparently imported from Sweden and China. It
is stated that the plaintiffs' own affirmations before Regulatory Agencies,
Courts and different patent offices would show that TICAGRELOR is covered by
several patents with different dates of expiry including Indian Patent 241229
and its equivalents.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 7 of 57
(ii) It is further pleaded that the plaintiffs have deliberately suppressed
material facts. The plaintiff has failed to mention that the patent No.241229
(the genus patent) expressly covers and discloses TICAGRELOR and has expired
on 14.7.2018. It is stated that the plaintiff has given a false impression
that the TICAGRELOR cannot be recognized from the said patent No.241229. It is
pleaded that there is sufficient material which also comprises admissions by
the plaintiffs to show that TICAGRELOR is encompassed and claimed in IN241229
(hereinafter referred to as IN 229) and its equivalent patents across the
world. Reliance is placed on Form 27 filed in India for IN 229 which expressly
refers to BRILINTA and AXCER products being covered by IN 229. Reliance is
also made on Patent Term Extension request filed before USPTO in respect of US
910(equivalent to IN
229). Reference is also made to other such documents to plead that there are
clear admissions of the plaintiff that TICAGRELOR is encompassed and claimed
in IN 229 which patent expired on 14.07.2018.
(iii) It is further pleaded that the plaintiffs have deliberately failed to
state and mention that the foreign patent equivalents of the said patents have
been held invalid in contested proceedings. Reference is made to the
proceedings in China, Europe and South Korea.
(iv) It is further pleaded that the present case is a textbook instance of
patent Ever-greening by the plaintiffs perpetuated with the intent of
illegally extending patent monopoly granted to them vide IN'229 with respect
to TICAGRELOR. It is pleaded that any party in India is free to manufacture or
sell a generic version of TICAGRELOR after expiry of IN'229 on 14.7.2018. It
is further stated that the malafide of the plaintiff is also established by
the fact that the plaintiffs sought illegal extension of this
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 8 of 57 patent monopoly available under IN'229
as is evident from the fact that the plaintiffs have filed/obtained patent
protection with respect to the same Markush, namely, TICAGRELOR subsequently
in IN'907 and IN'984 as well.
(v) It is further pleaded that the plaintiffs are guilty of latches and delay.
It is pleaded that the plaintiffs were aware about the factum of grant of
approvals by the Indian Drug Regulator to defendant No.2 to manufacture
TICAGRELOR in 2015. Hence, it is pleaded that the averments made in the plaint
that the plaintiff had knowledge about the launch of the defendants' product
in only 2017 and thereafter is absolutely false.
(vi) It is further stated that the defendants are neither manufacturing nor
selling any products claimed by the suit patents. Therefore, there is no case
for infringement of the suit patent. It is stated that defendant No.2 has not
commercialized the pending TICAGRELOR in any form and does not intend to do so
at least till 14.7.2018 when IN'229 expires.
(vii) It is further stated that no part of the cause of action has arisen in
Delhi.
16\. It is further stated in the written statement that the suit patents are
invalid on the grounds stated in section 64 of the Indian Patent Act. It is
pleaded that under section 107 of the Act, every ground under which a patent
can be revoked based on Section 64 is available as a defence in a suit for
infringement.
Regarding the patent IN 907 the following broad submissions are raised:
(i) Reliance is placed on Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act to state that IN
907 lacks novelty as the same is comprehensively covered in IN 229
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 9 of 57 which has an earlier priority date than
IN 907 i.e. 22.07.1997. Compounds as disclosed and covered in IN 907 are known
and anticipated through prior claiming based on IN 229. Such compounds are
easily developed by a person skilled in the art based on performing
routine/regular experimentation including making substitution as disclosed in
IN 229. Hence, it is prayed that IN 907 is liable to be revoked being invalid
based on anticipation by prior claiming through IN 229.
(ii) Reliance is also placed on Section 64(1) (f) of the Act to contend that
the claims in IN 907 are obvious to a person skilled in the art and do not
involve any inventive steps on the basis of prior art documents which provide
sufficient teaching, suggestion and motivation to enable a person skilled in
the art to prepare the compounds claimed in the impugned patents. There is
sufficient teaching also in the common general knowledge that was prevalent in
the field of drug designing/pharmaceuticals/chemistry before the priority date
of the suit patent.
(iii) Reliance is also placed on Section 64(1)(d) and 64(1)(k) of the Act to
state that the subject matter of the claims IN 907 does not qualify as an
invention within the meaning of the Patents Act and is invalid and liable to
be revoked. It is reiterated that the compound TICAGRELOR lacks novelty being
comprehensively anticipated by prior claiming through the claims in IN 229. It
is reiterated that this is admitted by the plaintiff by their affirmative acts
when they filed Form 27 from 2012 to 2018 for IN 229 and IN 907.
(iv) Reliance is also placed on Section 64(1)(h) to submit that complete
specifications to sufficiently and fairly describe the invention have not been
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 10 of 57 given. Reliance is also placed on
Section 64(1)(j) to plead that the patent was obtained by false suggestions
and representations.
(v) Reliance is also placed on Section 64(1)(m) to claim that the applicant
failed to disclose to the Controller information required under Section 8 of
the Act.
17\. Somewhat identical submissions are made to submit that the patent IN 984
and IN 674 are invalid.
18\. In CS(COMM) 1023/2018, written statement has been filed after the
arguments were concluded. However, a reply was filed to IA No.9332/2018.
Defendant here is Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.
The following broad defences have been raised by the said defendant to plead
that the suit is devoid of merits:-
(i) It is pleaded that the plaintiffs' own case is that the TICAGRELOR is
covered within the generic scope of IN 229 genus patent which has expired on
14.07.2018. However, to overcome the effect of the expiry of the said patent,
the plaintiffs are trying to create a false dichotomy between coverage and
disclosure by asserting that IN 229 generically covers but does not
specifically disclose TICAGRELOR. It is stated that this false dichotomy of
―coverage‖ and ―disclosure‖ is created to artificially extend its monopoly
through subsequent patents on TICAGRELOR.
(ii) It is further pleaded that the plaintiffs have attempted to Ever-Green
its invention. It is stated that the present case is a classic case of Ever-
greening of a life saving drug. It is further stated that primarily patent of
IN 229 has expired on 14.07.2018 and that the plaintiffs are cleverly
asserting three subsequent patents to overcome the limitation caused due to
the said expiry. It is stated that that the present suit is merely a ploy to
artificially CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 11 of 57 extend the period of IN
229. It is pleaded that the suit patents lack any inventive step. Further the
suit patents do not exhibit any therapeutic efficacy over the known substances
disclosed in IN 229.It is pleaded that there are no pleadings in the plaint
regarding the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy of the subject matter of the
suit patents. Hence, it is stated that the patent of the plaintiff is liable
to be revoked under Section 64(1)(K), Section 2(1) (ja) and Section 3(d) of
the Patent Act, 1970.
(iii) Reliance is also placed on sections 64(1)(d) and 2(1) (ja) of the Patent
Act to claim that a patent can be revoked if it is not an invention under the
meaning of the Act. It is pleaded that the patent IN 907 does not involve any
inventive step vis-à-vis the existing knowledge contained in IN 229 patent. It
is stated that the plaintiffs are trying to plead that a person skilled in the
art could not have recognized TICAGRELOR from the generic disclosure of IN229.
The plaintiffs also assert that TICAGRELOR is a genus patent over a Markush
structure which covers 150 quintillion compounds (1.5 x 10 20). It is pleaded
that as per the plaintiffs own case, the US counterpart of IN 229 (US
910) specifically indentifies and exemplifies 144 compounds, 134 out of which
are specifically disclosed in claim 8 of IN 229. Thus a person skilled in the
art does not have to experiment with 150 quintillion compounds but only with
144 or 134 compounds which are readily available for him to further experiment
and create/identify derivatives suitable as drug candidates.
(iv) It is further stated that the defendant is selling TICAFLO i.e.
TICAGRELOR and TICAGRELOR is generically disclosed in IN 229 which is
admittedly sold in India under the name BRILINTA and AXCER.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 12 of 57
The defendant, it is pleaded, is practicing IN 229 which is now in the public
domain by virtue of the expiry of IN 229.
(v) The pleas under Section 64(1) (a), (d), (e), (i), (j) and (k) are
reiterated to plead that the suit patents are liable to be revoked.
(vi) It is further pleaded that the plaintiff alleged loss and harm can be
easily compensated as the loss of revenue and profits are clearly calculable
and determinable. In case the plaintiff succeeds in the suit this loss can
easily be compensated.
19\. In CS(COMM) 792/2018, the main defendant here is Natco Pharma Ltd. Apart
from repeating most of the above contentions, the defendants in the present
suit reiterate that to the best knowledge of the defendant, the patent has
been refused in several countries including China, Europe and South Korea.
These details, it is pleaded, have been suppressed in the present suit.
20\. The said defendant has also filed counter claims for revocation of Indian
Patent IN 907, IN 984 and IN 674.
21\. In the counter-claim filed to seek revocation of IN 984 some of the
salient contents raised are as follows:-
(i) It is pleaded that the suit patent is not novel having regard to what was
publicly known or published in India or elsewhere. Reliance is placed on
Section 64(1)(e) to contend that it lacks novelty. It is claimed that the
impugned claim is not novel in view of WO 00/034283 (WO'283). Reliance is
placed on an experiment conducted by Dr.Fritz B. Blatter on 27.8.2012 where it
was demonstrated that the final product of example 3 of WO 283 is nothing but
a crystal compound claimed in the impugned patent. It is stated
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 13 of 57 that as a result of the above
disclosure the European Patent Office revoked the patent.
(ii) It is further stated that the subject matter patent is obvious in nature
and does not involve any inventive step having regard to what was publicly
known or published in India or anywhere else. Reliance is placed on Section
64(1)(f) of the Act. It is pleaded that the aforesaid claims are obvious in
view of the prior art WO 283. It is stated that WO―283 taken together with
other prior art documents as well as available common general knowledge would
enable a person skilled in the art to identify the polymorph claimed in the
impugned patent.
(iii) It is further stated that impugned patent is not sufficiently or
properly described. Reliance is placed on section 64(1) (h).
(iv) It is also pleaded that the patent is not patentable under the Act.
Reliance is placed on section 3(d) read with section 64(1) (k) of the Act. It
is stated that there is no data to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of the
compound over known compounds specially TICAGRELOR which is disclosed by WO
283. Hence, the claim is invalid in view of section 3(d) of the Patent Act.
(v) Reliance is also placed on section 64(1)(d) to contend that the said claim
is not an invention within the meaning of the Act. The impugned suit patent
does not possess an inventive step and is obvious to a person skilled in the
art.
(vi) It is also pleaded that the plaintiff has failed to comply with section 8
of the Act. It is stated that the plaintiff has failed to intimate the Indian
Patent Office of the status of all corresponding foreign applications
including details regarding grant, refusal, abandonment etc. Reliance is also
placed on CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 14 of 57 section 64 (1)(m) of the Act
to state that the impugned patent is liable to be revoked.
22\. Counter-claim is also filed for revocation of Indian Patent 209907. It
has been claimed in the counter-claim that the invention as claimed was
claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date i.e. IN 229. It is stated
that the compound already claimed and granted in IN 229 has once again been
claimed and granted in IN 907. It is pleaded that the plaintiff has played a
fraud on the Indian Patent Office and before this court as the correct picture
has not been placed before the court. It is pleaded that based on prior claim
the claims of the impugned patent are liable to be rejected.
Reliance is also placed on section 64(1)(f) of the Act. It is reiterated that
the impugned patent does not involve any inventive step having regard to what
was publicly known and used in India. A person skilled in the art armed with
the prior art and with common general knowledge would be in a position to
arrive at TICAGRELOR.
Reliance is also placed on section 64(1)(h) of the Act. It is stated that the
impugned patent is not properly described. Reliance is also placed on section
64(1)(k) read with section 3(d) of the Act. It is stated that the
specification of the plaintiff does not provide any data to demonstrate
therapeutic efficacy of the compound or know compounds especially TICAGRELOR
which is disclosed by IN 229.
Reliance is also placed on section 64(1)(d) and section 2(1)(j) of the Act to
claim that the patent is liable to be revoked.
Reliance is also placed on section 8 read with section 64 (1)(m) of the Act.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 15 of 57
23\. Another counter-claim is also filed seeking revocation of Indian Patent
No.272 674 substantially on the same aforenoted grounds.
24\. The plaintiff has filed its replication/written statement to the counter-
claim.
25\. I have heard the learned counsel for the plaintiffs and the learned
senior counsel/counsel for the defendants. Learned senior counsel/counsel for
the defendants have raised somewhat common contentions. I may note some of the
salient contentions.
26\. Learned senior counsel for the defendants i.e. Micro Labs Ltd. in CS(COMM
749/2018 has broadly raised the following contentions to plead that this court
may vacate the interim orders passed by this court:
(i) It has been pleaded that IN 229 discloses TICAGRELOR which patent has
expired on 14.07.2018. It is stated that this is evident from the fact that in
the US equivalent of IN229 i.e. US910, the plaintiffs have expressly made an
admission that US 910 discloses and claims TICAGRELOR. Reliance is also placed
on Section 13(1)(b) of the Act.
(ii) It has further been pleaded that the suit patents are a classic instance
of Ever-Greening. IN 229 expressly discloses and covers through its claims 1
and 7 TICAGRELOR. The product TICAGRELOR, it is reiterated, has been admitted
by the plaintiffs in US litigations for infringement of US 910 to be revealed
in IN 229. It is further stated that even before the Indian Patent Office
while filing forms 27, the plaintiffs expressly admit that IN 229 covers and
claims TICAGRELOR. It is pleaded that Form 27 filed by the plaintiff for IN
229 is identical to Form 27 filed in respect of IN 907, IN 984 and IN 674.
Hence, it is stated that at this stage, in view of the stated
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 16 of 57 admissions made by the plaintiff, this
court may not grant interim injunction to protect the plaintiffs.
(iii) It has been further pleaded that the patents which correspond to IN 907
and IN 984 have been refused in various countries. It is stated that the
European Patent corresponding to IN 984 has been revoked by the European
Patent Office Opposition Board, Chinese Patent corresponding to IN 907 was
invalidated in October 2017. It is pleaded that these material facts have been
suppressed by the plaintiffs. It is further pleaded that there is non-
compliance of Section 8(1) & Section 8(2) of the Act since details of this
revocation and such proceedings were concealed from the Indian Patent Office.
(iv) It has further been pleaded that defendant No.2 filed two separate
revocation petitions before IPAB in respect of IN 907 and IN 984 in October
2015 much prior to filing of the present suit. The revocation petitions, it is
urged, are bona fide and not a counter blast to the suit. It has been pleaded
that a credible challenge to the two patents is pending prior to filing of the
present suit and that itself would be a ground for this court to vacate the
present interim orders passed. Reliance is placed on the judgment of a
Division Bench of this court in F.Hoffman LA Roche Ltd. vs. Cipla Ltd., 2009
(40) PTL 125 (Del) to argue that where there is a credible challenge to the
validity of the patent it is sufficient to deny interim relief to the
plaintiff.
(v) It is further submitted that the plaintiff has not come to court with
clean hands. The plaintiff has impleaded defendant No.1 as one Mr.P.Kumar
whereas the main defendant is Micro Labs Ltd. Hence, Mr.P.Kumar was added only
to mask the target Micro Labs Ltd.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 17 of 57
27\. Learned senior counsel for the defendants Natco Pharma Ltd. in CS(COMM)
792/2018 has broadly urged as follows to plead that this court may vacate the
interim orders passed:-
(i) It has been strongly pleaded that the plaintiffs have deliberately and
mischievously impleaded Mr. T. Rao as defendant No. 1. The suit and the cause
of action is actually against defendant No. 2 which is Natco Pharma Ltd. The
plaintiffs have deliberately and mischievously filed the memo of parties in
this manner impleading defendant No. 1 who has no role to play in the present
litigation to mislead the defendant and the court.
(ii) He submits that IN 229 discloses TICAGRELOR which is prior claimed.
TICAGRELOR was already claimed in claim 2-7 of IN 229. Reliance is also placed
on admissions made by the plaintiff while filing Form 27 which as filed for IN
907 are the same as the Form 27 filed for IN
229\. Reliance is also placed on similar admissions made by the plaintiff in
USA for patent term extension. It is further pleaded that this is a case of
re- patenting or re-claiming. Hence, it is pleaded that the said patent is
liable to be revoked under Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 64(1)(a) of the
Act.
(iii) It has been strongly reiterated that TICAGRELOR is very much disclosed
in IN 229. Working statements of the two patents, namely, IN 229 and IN 907
are identical. The drug which has been marketed by the plaintiffs BRILINTA and
AXCER is TICAGRELOR only. TICAGRELOR forms an integral part of IN 229 which
patent has expired.
(iv) It has been further stressed that other countries have revoked the
patents of the plaintiffs which is equivalent to IN 907. Chinese patent
equivalent to IN 907 was invalidated in China. European patent equivalent to
IN 984 was revoked, the Korean patent was also revoked. Chinese patent
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 18 of 57 equivalent to IN 674 was refused. It is
stated that all these facts have been suppressed by the plaintiff before the
India Patent Office and before this court. Hence, it is pleaded that the
patents of the plaintiffs are liable to be revoked on account of suppression
of facts and this court should on this ground alone vacate the interim orders.
(v) It has also been strongly urged that the drug in question is being sold by
the plaintiffs at Rs.50 per tablet whereas the defendants propose to sell the
same at Rs.20 each. It is stated that in view of this fact the interim order
passed will cause grave and irreparable loss and injury and hence the interim
order be vacated by this court.
28\. Learned counsel appearing in CS(COMM) 1023/2018 has reiterated the above
contentions to plead that this court may vacate the interim orders passed. He
broadly pleads as follows:
(i) He submits that the defendant is using IN 229 which is an expired patent.
It is pleaded that the plaintiffs admit that TICAGRELOR is covered by IN 229.
It is further stated that the plaintiff claims that TICAGRELOR is covered but
not disclosed by IN 229. It is pleaded that such a contention was completely
rejected by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case of Novartis AG. v.
UOI, 2013 (6) SCC 1. It is hence pleaded that the contentions of the plaintiff
cannot be accepted.
(ii) It is reiterated that IN 229 is admittedly a valid prior art for IN 984
and IN 674. To support this contention, it is stated that IN 229 was published
on 04.02.1999 prior to the priority date of IN 984 (02.02.2000) and IN 674
(21.08.2006). Clearly, it is pleaded that these two patents are in any case
invalid.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 19 of 57
(iii) It is further stated that the suit patent IN 907 has been revoked in
China. IN 984 has been revoked in China, Europe and South Korea. It has been
refused in Brazil and Argentina. Hence, it is pleaded that the suit patent is
clearly vulnerable to challenge in these proceedings.
(iv) It is further stated that it is the admission of the plaintiffs that
TICAGRELOR is structurally closest to the compound of example 68 of IN
229\. It is hence stated that being a derivative of a known substance,
TICAGRELOR is squarely hit by Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act. It is
pleaded that there is not a whisper in the plaint claiming enhanced
therapeutic efficacy for IN 907 i.e. the suit patent. Reliance is again placed
on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Novartis AG. v. UOI (supra) to contend
that in the absence of enhanced efficacy, the said product would not be
patentable.
29\. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs has however rebutted the aforesaid
contentions of the defendants and pleaded that the interim orders passed be
confirmed by this court. He has pleaded as follows:-
(i) On the plea of the defendants on anticipation i.e. section 13(1)(a) of the
Act it is stated that the genus patent (IN 229) was published on 2nd February
1999 i.e. after the priority date of the species patent (IN 907) (4.12.1998).
Therefore, it is stated that the genus patent cannot constitute a prior art
document for evaluating the novelty of the species patent. Hence, it is stated
that the plea of anticipation raised by the defendant is not applicable to the
present case. It is further stated that there is no specific or enabling
disclosure of TICAGRELOR in the genus patent. Genus patent only discloses (1.5
x 1020) compounds one of which was later discovered to be TICAGRELOR. A person
of ordinary skill in the art would not have been CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page
20 of 57 able to identify or isolate TICAGRELOR based on the teaching of the
genus patent.
It is further pleaded that that the analysis undertaken by the defendant to
show that TICAGRELOR can be derived from general Markush formula in the genus
patent is untenable and is a case of hind sight bias i.e. cherry picking of
substituents based on ex post facto knowledge of the final molecule to be
obtained.
(ii) On the contention of the defendants of prior claiming i.e. section
13(1)(b) of the Act, it is stated that the same requires a specific
individualized claim. A broad claim which may cover TICAGRELOR among millions
of other compounds is insufficient for the purpose of prior claiming. It is
reiterated that there is no claim in the genus patent which specifically
claims TICAGRELOR. Hence, it is stated that the plea of Prior Claiming of the
defendant is not applicable.
(iii) On the applicability of section 3(d) of the Patent Act i.e. Ever-
greening it is pleaded that the defendants have not been able to point out any
known substance from the genus patent of which TICAGRELOR could be considered
a new form/derivative. Merely because examples 32 and 68 are structurally
close to TICAGRELOR does not mean that TICAGRELOR is a new form or derivative
of the former. Mere structural similarity is not sufficient to trigger section
3(d) of the Act.
It is further stated that even otherwise TICAGRELOR has demonstrably greater
therapeutic efficacy as can be seen from the affidavit of Dr.Robert Riley
which is relied upon by the defendant's Dr.Reddy's Laboratory. It is stated
that this affidavit shows that TICAGRELOR has a CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page
21 of 57 vastly superior metabolic stability and its availability in the body
would be far greater.
(iv) On the argument about non disclosure of various revocation proceedings
outside India i.e. alleged non-compliance of Section 8 of the Act it is stated
that equivalent of IN 907 was revoked in China but an appeal has been filed
which implies an automatic stay of the operation of the revocation order. It
is further stated that 57 countries have granted patent for the same.
Regarding IN 984 it is accepted that in Europe and China the patent was
revoked. However, as an appeal has been filed and there is an automatic stay
in operation. It is reiterated that the patent has been granted in 55
countries. Regarding the patent IN 674 it is stated that there is no
revocation order passed and the patent is subsisting in 60 countries, It is
stated that there is substantial compliance by the plaintiff of the statutory
provisions and there is no mala fide suppression and hence section 8 of the
Patent Act would have no application.
(v) Regarding the reliance of the defendants on the alleged admissions made by
the plaintiff in the US Patent Term extension applications and in form 27
filed by the plaintiff in India, it is stated that form 27 only states that
the genus patent has worked through TICAGRELOR. This does not mean that
TICAGRELOR has been disclosed therein. It is stated that multiple patents can
cover a single product. It is further stated that the genus patent discloses
an entire class of compounds and thus does not pertain to a commercialized
substance. It is the only after the act of isolation of TICAGRELOR through
species patent that the plaintiff has been able to state that the genus patent
is being worked or commercialized through Brilinta.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 22 of 57
Regarding the litigation filed in USA and the alleged admission in the
proceedings, it is stated that the plaintiff's action is consistent with the
US Laws in the said proceedings.
(vi) It has been reiterated that the plaintiffs are servicing around 6 lac
patients a year and not 72,000/- as claimed by the defendants. Hence, it is
prayed that the interim order passed by this court may continue as plaintiff
has a strong prima facie case.
(vii) Learned counsel has also vehemently argued that the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Novartis v. UOI, (supra) has no application to
the facts of this case. It is stated that the Supreme Court in the said case
has stated that coverage (for the purpose of infringement) will not be granted
by the court unless a specific disclosure has been made in the patent. This
does not mean that disclosure can be deemed to the extent of coverage
asserted. It is stated that in the said case there had been an actual
disclosure of Imatinib Mesylate in the Zimmermann patent.
30\. I may now deal with the submissions of the parties. [I] Is TICAGRELOR
disclosed and covered in the now expired patent IN229
31\. One of the main disputes relates to the contention of the defendants that
IN 229 covers/discloses TICAGRELOR and that the suit patents cannot be said to
be an invention. It is stated that compounds as claimed in the suit patents
are known and anticipated in the light of IN 229. The plaintiff claims that
TICAGRELOR is not disclosed in IN 229 and that TICAGRELOR is an invention and
is patentable.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 23 of 57
32\. To determine the dispute, I may look at some of the relevant statutory
provisions. Reference may be had to Section 2(j), 2(ja), 2(m) and Section
3(a), (c) and (d) of the Patent Act. The said sections read as follows:-
> ―2. Definitions and interpretation. -
> (1) xxx [(j) "invention" means a new product or process involving an
> inventive step and capable of industrial application;] [[(ja) "inventive
> step" means a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as
> compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both
> and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art;]]
> xxx
> (m) "patent" means a patent for any invention granted under this Act;] xxx‖
> 3\. What are not inventions. -The following are not inventions within the
> meaning of this Act,-
> (a) an invention which is frivolous or which claims anything obviously
> contrary to well established natural laws;
> (b) xxx
> (c) the mere discovery of a scientific principle or the formulation of an
> abstract theory 20 [or discovery of any living thing or non- living
> substances occurring in nature];
> [(d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not
> result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the
> mere discovery of any new property or new use for a known substance or of
> the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless such known
> process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.
> Explanation. -For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers,
> CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 24 of 57 polymorphs, metabolites, pure form,
> particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and
> other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same
> substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to
> efficacy;]‖
33\. Reference may be had in this context to the judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of Novartis AG vs. Union of India, 2013 (6) SCC 1 where the
Supreme Court held as follows:-
> ―74. Section 2(1)(j) requires a product to satisfy three conditions to
> qualify as an invention:
> (i) It must be ―new‖, that is to say it must not have been anticipated;
> (ii) Its coming into being must involve an ―inventive step‖; and
> 34\. It must be ―capable of industrial application‖, that is to say it must
> be capable of being made or used in an industry [Section 2(1)(ac)].
> 75\. ―Inventive step‖ is separately defined in Section 2(ja) to mean a
> feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the
> existing knowledge, or having economic significance or both and that makes
> the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art. To paraphrase, the
> invention that creates the product must have a feature that involves
> technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic
> significance or both and this feature should be such as to make the
> invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.
> 76\. On a combined reading of clauses (j), (ac) and (ja) of Section 2(1), in
> order to qualify as ―invention‖, a product must, therefore, satisfy the
> following tests:
> (i) It must be ―new‖;
> (ii) It must be ―capable of being made or used in an industry‖;
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 25 of 57
> (iii) It must come into being as a result of an invention which has a
> feature that:
> (a) entails technical advance over existing knowledge;
> or
> (b) has an economic significance;
> and
> (c) makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.
> 77\. We have seen the meaning of ―invention‖; we have also seen earlier that
> the Patents Act, 1970, dealt with ―invention‖ and ―patentability‖ as two
> distinctly separate concepts. The duality of the two concepts is best
> illustrated by Section 4 of the Act, which prohibits the grant of patent
> (either process or product) ―in respect of inventions relating to atomic
> energy falling within sub- section (1) of Section 20 of the Atomic Energy
> Act, 1962‖, and which has not undergone any change since inception. It is,
> therefore, fundamental that for grant of patent the subject must satisfy the
> twin tests of ―invention‖ and ―patentability‖. Something may be an
> ―invention‖ as the term is generally understood and yet it may not qualify
> as an ―invention‖ for the purposes of the Act. Further, something may even
> qualify as an ―invention‖ as defined under the Act and yet may be denied
> patent for other larger considerations as may be stipulated in the Act.
> Having, therefore, seen the meaning of ―invention‖, we may now advert to
> Section 3 as it stands after the amendment of the Act in 2005.
34\. For the purpose of deciding the aforesaid dispute, reference may also be
had to the judgment of the Supreme court in the case of Bishwanath Prasad
Radhey Shyam vs. Hindustan Metal Industries, AIR 1982 SC 1444. The Supreme
Court held as follows:-
> ―25 Whether an alleged invention involves novelty and an 'inventive step',
> is a mixed question of law and fact, depending largely on the circumstances
> of the case. Although no absolute test uniformly applicable in all
> circumstances can be devised, certain CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 26 of 57
> broad criteria can be indicated. Whether the "manner of manufacture"
> patented, was publicly known, used and practised in the country before or at
> the date of the patent ? If the answer to this question is 'yes', it will
> negative novelty or 'subject matter'. Prior public knowledge of the alleged
> invention which would disqualify the grant of a patent can be by word of
> mouth or by publication through books or other media. "If the public once
> becomes possessed of an invention", says Hindmarch on Patents (quoted with
> approval by Fry L. J. in Humpherson v. Syer, "by any means whatsoever, no
> subsequent patent for it can be granted either to the true or first inventor
> himself or any other person; for the public cannot be deprived of the right
> to use the invention........ the public already possessing everything that
> he could give."
> 26\. The expression "does not involve any inventive step" used in Section
> 26(1) (a) of the Act and its equivalent word "obvious", have acquired
> special significance in the terminology of Patent Law. The 'obviousness' has
> to be strictly and objectively judged. For this determination several forms
> of the question have been suggested. The one suggested by Salmond L. J. in
> Rado v. John Tye & Son Ltd. is apposite. It is: "Whether the alleged
> discovery lies so much out of the Track of what was known before as not
> naturally to suggest itself to a person thinking on the subject, it must not
> be the obvious or natural suggestion of what was previously known."
> 27\. Another test of whether a document is a publication which would
> negative existence of novelty or an "inventive step" is suggested, as under:
> "Had the document been placed in the hands of a competent craftsman (or
> engineer as distinguished from a mere artisan), endowed with the common
> general knowledge at the 'priority date', who was faced with the problem
> solved by the patentee but without knowledge of the patented invention,
> would he have said, "this gives me what I want?" (Encyclopedia Britannica;
> ibid). To put it in another form: "Was it for practical purposes obvious to
> a skilled worker, in the field concerned, in the state of knowledge existing
> at the date of the patent to be found in the literature then
> CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 27 of 57 available to him, that hewould or
> should make the invention the subject of the claim concerned ?" Halsbury,
> 3rd Edn, Vol. 29, p. 42 referred to by Vimadalal J. of Bombay High Court in
> Farbwrke Hoechst & B. Corporation v. Untchan Laboratories, MNU/MH/0064/1969
> : AIR 1969 Bom 255.‖
> 35\. It is the case of the plaintiffs that the ‗genus patent' being IN 229
> discloses a huge class of 1.5 x 1020 compounds one of which was later
> discovered to be TICAGRELOR. It further stated that claim 5 of the species
> patent i.e. IN 907 covers the molecule TICAGRELOR selected out of 150
> quintillion compounds covered by IN 229. It is further the case of the
> plaintiffs that a person ordinarily skilled in the art would not have been
> able to identify or isolate TICAGRELOR based on the teachings of the genus
> patent.
36\. The defendants have denied the said contention of the plaintiffs. The
defendants submit that TICAGRELOR can be achieved from substitution and
preferences listed in IN 229. They also rely upon various admissions to this
effect allegedly made by the plaintiffs while filing statutory details in
India and abroad and also while pursuing litigation abroad to support their
case.
37\. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. raises a plea that TICAGRELOR is covered
and disclosed in the claims of IN 229 which are elaborated as follows:-
> ―Furthermore, that Ticagrelor is explicitly covered and disclosed in the
> claims of IN229 can been demonstrated from the below table, which shows how
> Ticagrelor can be achieved from the limitations of claims of IN229:-

CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 30 of 57 a phenyl, the phenyl group itself being
substituted by one or more halogen, C3-8-alkyl, phenoxy or phenyl groups
38\. The defendant Micro Labs Ltd. states that IN 229 specifically discloses
and covers through claim 1 and claim 7 the product TICAGRELOR. The defendant
NATCO Ltd. states that claims 2-7 of IN 229 leads to TICAGRELOR. It is stated
that claims 2 to 7 specifically claim certain compounds and TICAGRELOR can be
derived from the substitution as suggested in the claim. IN 229 claims ―A
Triazolo (4, 5-0) Pyrimidine compound of formula (I)‖ IN 907 it is stated
claims the same product.
39\. It is manifest from the above submission that there are two rival stands
available on record. The stand of the defendants is that there is similarity
of structure that exists between the prior patent IN 229 and the subsequent
patents. They plead that IN 229 discloses TICAGRELOR. The plaintiff denies
this. The Supreme Court in Biswnath Prasad Radhey Shyam v. Hindustan Metal
Industries Ltd.(supra) held that as to whether an alleged invention involves
novelty or is an inventive step is a mixed question of law and facts. A Co-
ordinate Bench of this court in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company & Ors. v.
Mr.J.D.Joshi & Anr., 2015 (64) PTC 135 (Del) has noted that the challenges
which can be raised under the provisions of the section 64 of the Patents Act,
1970 are in the nature of questions dependent on facts or the mixed question
of facts and laws. The claim of the defendant stated above i.e. that IN 229
discloses TICAGRELOR would be a mixed question of law and fact.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 31 of 57
40\. A Co-ordinate Bench of this court in the case of Merck Sharp & Dohme
Corporation & Anr. v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 223 (2015) DLT 454, on
this context noted as follows:
> ―57. From the facts narrated hereinabove it is clear that matter involves
> invention of a chemical molecule/compound in the medicinal field and is of
> highly technical nature. In such like matter Court has to go by the opinion
> of the experts in the field, whose testimony is found trustworthy and
> reliable, inasmuch as, is supported by the documents. The Court has not to
> super impose its view over and above the technical experts, more so when
> judges are not experts in chemical and medicinal filed. In Martin F.D'Souza
> v. Mohd. Ishfaq, 157(2009) DLT 391 (SC) = 12(2009) CPJ 32 (SC) = II(2009)
> SLT 20 = (2009) 3 SCC 1, Supreme Court held thus: ―the Courts and Consumer
> Fora are not experts in medical science, and must not substitute their own
> views over that of specialists‖.
41\. I may only note that at this stage the parties have yet to lead their
evidence. It is only once the evidence of the experts is recorded and
subjected to appropriate cross-examination, a conclusion can be reached as to
whether the submissions as stated above would show as to whether the claims of
the genus patent IN 229 discloses TICAGRELOR.
42\. However, for the purpose of this application there are other facts i.e.
alleged admissions said to have been made by the plaintiffs which have been
heavily relied upon by the defendants to argue and submit that the plaintiffs
have themselves admitted that TICAGRELOR is disclosed in IN 229. I may look at
some of these alleged admissions.
43\. A reference has been made by the defendants to the Statement of Working
stated in Form 27 filed by the plaintiffs before the Controller of
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 32 of 57 Patents. It is stated that the
plaintiffs have declared TICAGRELOR as patented invention of IN 229. For IN
229, on 21.03.2018, the plaintiffs filed the following Form 27 which reads as
follows-
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 33 of 57
44\. Similarly, for IN 907 the following Form 27 was filed on the same date
i.e. 21.03.2018 for the same period i.e. 2017:-
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 34 of 57
45\. Similar information has been filed for IN 984 and IN 674 for the same
period i.e. 2017 which read as follows:-
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 35 of 57 CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 36 of 57
46\. A perusal of the above forms would show that the same and identical
returns are being filed for different patents by the plaintiff i.e. for IN
229, IN 907, IN 984 and IN 674. The above returns show that for the year 2017,
a sale of BRILIANTA of 1,884,470 PACKS has been shown in the returns for each
of the four noted patents. Similarly, for drug AXCER, the same quantum, namely
1,797,194 PACKS sale have been stated under the four patents. Some of the
defendants have also filed the said Form 27 filed by the plaintiff for the
previous years starting from 2014. In each of the returns the same situation
exists. It is clear from a reading of the said forms that the plaintiffs are
not in any manner showing separate figures for the working of the said four
patents or the quantum and value of the patented products that was sold. The
same product and quantity is stated to show the working of the three suit
patents and the expired patent IN 229.
47\. Reference may also be had to another document/ alleged admissions relied
upon by the defendants which relates to a litigation in US against Mylan INC
to enforce US Patent 6251910 (equivalent to IN 229). In the said proceedings
filed before the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
the plaintiffs stated as follows:-
> ―1. This is an action for patent infringement arising under the patent laws
> of the United States, Title 35, United States Code, against defendants Mylan
> Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively "Mylan" or "Defendant").
> This action relates to Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") No. 208597
> ("ticagrelor ANDA") filed by Defendant with the U.S. Food and Drug
> Administration ("FDA") for approval to market generic versions of
> AstraZeneca's BRILINTA® (ticagrelor) drug product in tablet forms and in 60
> mg and 90 mg dosage strengths, prior to expiration of AstraZeneca's U.S.
> Patent Nos. 6,251,910 ("the '910 patent"); 6,525,060 ("the '060 patent");
> 7,250,419 ("the '419 CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 37 of 57 patent");
> 7,265,124 ("the '124 patent"); and 8,425,934 ("the '934 patent") that are
> listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence
> Evaluations ("Orange Book") for BRILINTA® (collectively "the Orange Book
> Patents"). ...
5\. Plaintiff AstraZeneca UK Limited is a company operating and existing under
the laws of United Kingdom, with its principal place of business at 15
Stanhope Gate, London, United Kingdom WIY 6LN. AstraZeneca UK Limited is the
owner of the '910, '060, and '419 patents, and Defendant specifically directed
its Notice Letters to AstraZeneca UK Limited.‖ Hence, in the above noted
proceedings the plaintiffs have acknowledged and stated that dealing in
TICAGRELOR is in breach of US patent 910 (equivalent of IN 229) also.
48\. Similarly, the defendant-Micro Labs Ltd. also relies upon the stated
admissions of the plaintiffs in the Orange Book of US FDA, Estonian
Supplementary Protection Certificate and Canadian Patent Office Health
Register where it is stated that the plaintiffs have voluntarily listed US 910
as TICAGRELOR.
49\. Regarding Form 27 the plaintiffs deny the above submissions of the
defendant being any admission that TICAGRELOR is disclosed in IN 229. The
plaintiffs state that Form 27 only states that the genus patent (IN 229) has
worked through TICAGRELOR and that this does not mean that the TICAGRELOR has
been disclosed therein. It is pleaded that multiple patents can cover a single
product. It is further pleaded in the written submissions filed that the genus
patent ―IN229‖ discloses an entire class of compound. Thus, it does not
pertain to commercialized substances. It is only after isolation of TICAGRELOR
through species patent IN 907, the plaintiffs CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 38
of 57 have been able to state that the genus patent is being worked or
commercialized through BRILINTA.
50\. Regarding the proceeding in Delaware the plaintiff has taken the stand
that the assertion that genus patent is also infringed in the litigation above
in the US is as it is permissible in USA. Coverage is sufficient to institute
an infringement action in the US. It has been stated that the plaintiff's
action in the US are consistent with US laws.
51\. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also relied upon the judgments in
the case of Dr.Reddy's Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly & Co.Ltd., (2008)
EWHC 2345 (Pat) of the Royal Courts of Justice, London; Eli Lilly & Company
Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd., (2013) FCA 214 of Federal Court of Australia; and a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo
Canada Inc., Sanofi- Synthelabo & Minister of Health, (2008) 3 S.C.R. 265 to
stress his submission about difference between coverage of a genus patent and
disclosure.
52\. I may look at the aforenoted judgments relied upon by learned counsel for
the plaintiff. In Dr.Reddy's Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly &
Co.Ltd.(supra), the court held as follows:
> ―91. The notion that a prior disclosure does not take away the novelty of a
> claim to a specific compound unless the compound is disclosed in
> ―individualised form‖ is, I believe, a sound one. I will endeavour to
> explain why.
> 92\. Firstly, a general formula is an extremely powerful way of covering
> large number of chemical compounds: hence their frequent use in patent
> disclosure. It is, of course possible that someone could write down in
> succession all the compounds covered by all possible permutations of the
> variable substituents of the formula: but it is wholly artificial to suppose
> that anyone would. Attention would focus on CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 39
> of 57 compounds actually described, the remainder of the class being no more
> than a theoretical penumbra around those compounds.‖
53\. In Eli Lilly & Company Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd.(supra), the court held as
follows:
> ―326. I do not consider that it is as simple as he suggests, namely, that
> the skilled addressee would begin with the thienobenzodiazepine of the core
> and ‗build' appropriate analogies by the use of the variable substituents
> that need to be added to the core to arrive at olanzapine. No other witness
> accepted that this was the position. I accept the submission of Eli Lilly
> that it is not only the ex post facto ―cherry-picking‖ of specific
> substituents that one is liable to reach olanzapine from the compounds
> disclosed in the 235 Patent. The large number of compounds disclosed in the
> 235 Patent reflects the breadth of the teaching of that patent, and
> underscores the magnitude of the difficulty in selecting a single compound
> from the extensive class identified. Even if the skilled addressee limited
> attention to the most preferred class, there is no real guidance as to why
> it is preferred.‖
54\. In Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., Sanofi- Synthelabo &
Minister of Health(supra), the court held as follows:
> ―96. The concern expressed by Apotex is that the doctrine of selection
> patents allows a patent holder to ―evergreen‖ an invention. The original
> genus patent is granted for a finite period of years. If a selection patent
> is later obtained by the owner of the genus patent covering the same
> invention as the genus patent, the number of years the owner is entitled to
> exclude other from making or using the invention is extended, contrary to
> the limited period of exclusivity provided by the original patent.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 40 of 57
> 97\. Evergreening is a legitimate concern and, depending on the
> circumstances, strategies that attempt to extend the time limit of
> exclusivity of a patent may be contrary to the objectives of the Patent Act.
> The Act aims to promote inventiveness by conferring exclusivity for a
> limited period of time while providing for public disclosure of the
> invention to enable others to make or use it after expiry of the period of
> exclusivity.
> 98\. However, a generalized concern about evergreening is not a
> justification for an attack on the doctrine of selection patents for two
> reasons. First, a selection patent may be sought by a party other than the
> inventor or owner of the original genus patent. In such a case, anticipation
> or obviousness may be an issue, but evergreening does not arise.
> 99\. At the hearing, counsel for Apotex submitted that, in the
> pharmaceutical industry, the only party that would ever attempt to obtain a
> selection patent would be the genus patent holder. This is a highly
> competitive industry and a market participant who is able to develop a more
> effective product might be expected to be anxious to do so and seek patent
> protection through a selection patent even if it requires the making of an
> agreement with the holder of the genus patent to allow for the marketing of
> the selected product. However, even if counsel is correct, the doctrine of
> genus and selection patents is not restricted to the pharmaceutical
> industry. It is of general applicability.
> 100\. Second and more importantly, selection patents encourage improvements
> by selection. The inventor selects only a bit of the subject matter of the
> original genus patent because that bit does something better than and
> different from what was claimed in the genus patent.‖ CS(COMM.)749/2018 &
> etc. Page 41 of 57
55\. The said issue relating to coverage and disclosure of a genus patent was
raised by the appellant before the Supreme Court in Novartis AGs v. Union of
India & Ors.(supra). In the said judgment the Supreme Court noted the
submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, namely, that the
scope of coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a patent. It was
further contended that coverage under a patent of the Markush kind cannot lead
to any presumption of disclosure, much less any enabling disclosure of all the
compounds. The plea was rejected by the Supreme Court stating as follows:
> ―118. The submissions of Mr. Andhyarujina and Mr. Subramanium are based on
> making a distinction between the coverage or claim in a patent and the
> disclosure made therein. The submissions on behalf of the Appellant can be
> summed up by saying that the boundary laid out by the claim for coverage is
> permissible to be much wider than the disclosure/ enablement/ teaching in a
> patent.
> 119\. The dichotomy that is sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on
> the one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on the
> other hand, seems to strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of
> patent. Under the scheme of patent, a monopoly is granted to a private
> individual in exchange of the invention being made public so that, at the
> end of the patent term, the invention may belong to the people at large who
> may be benefited by it. To say that the coverage in a patent might go much
> beyond the disclosure thus seem to negate the fundamental rule underlying
> the grant of patents.
xxxxx
134\. However, before leaving Hogan and proceeding further, we would like to
say that in this country the law of patent, after the introduction of product
patent for all kinds of substances in the patent regime, is in its infancy. We
certainly do not wish the CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 42 of 57 law of patent
in this country to develop on lines where there may be a vast gap between the
coverage and the disclosure under the patent; where the scope of the patent is
determined not on the intrinsic worth of the invention but by the artful
drafting of its claims by skillful lawyers, and where patents are traded as a
commodity not for production and marketing of the patented products but to
search for someone who may be sued for infringement of the patent.‖ Hence, the
Supreme Court negated the argument that is sought to be made by learned
counsel for the plaintiff that coverage in a patent might go much beyond
disclosure. The plea of the plaintiff that genus patent has worked through
TICAGRELOR though TICAGRELOR is not disclosed in IN 229 cannot prima facie, at
this stage, be accepted. For the purpose of the present injunction
application, it can be said that the plaintiff have prima facie failed to
explain the admissions/conduct as contained in Form 27 filed as noted above
and the litigation commenced in USA against Mylan INC.
56\. What is further surprising is that the plaint is strikingly silent about
the said aspect of the patent IN 229 especially keeping in view the own
admissions of the plaintiff whereby they have claimed that IN 229 is worked
through TICAGRELOR.
57\. The date of grant of IN 229 is 24.06.2010. The date of grant of IN 907 is
11.09.2007.
The plaintiff states in the plaint that the drug regulatory approval for the
drug TICAGRELOR came in May 2011 and the same was commercially launched in
India in October, 2012 under the trademark BRILINTA. It is the case of the
plaintiffs in their submissions that it is only the act of isolation of
TICAGRELOR through the species patent i.e. IN 907 that the plaintiffs have
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 43 of 57 been able to state that the genus
patent is being worked or commercialized through Brilinta. Hence, the stand is
that prior to isolation of TICAGRELOR through species patent, there was no
commercial working of IN 229. Surprisingly, no such averment has been made in
the plaint by the plaintiffs. The only averment in the plaint about the patent
IN 229 is that the same is a genus patent covering vast number of compounds
and TICAGRELOR is not specifically disclosed in the genus patent though it is
technically within the generic scope of numerous compounds including in
Formula-I of the said application. It is further stated that a person skilled
in the art could not have recognized TICAGRELOR from the genus patent. That is
the sum and substance of the averment made by the plaintiffs in the plaint
regarding the patent IN 229 and it's connect with TICAGRELOR. None of the
above facts/explanations were pleaded or stated in the plaint. There is no
averment in the plaint to claim that IN 229 (genus patent) was worked through
TICAGRELOR though not disclosed in the said patent as is now sought to be
pleaded in course of arguments. There is no averment in the plaint that IN 229
does not pertain to a commercialized patent.
58\. The Division Bench of this court in F. Hoffmann-LA Roche Ltd. & Ors. vs.
Cipla Ltd. (supra) had on the question of disclosure as in the facts of that
case noted as follows:-
> ―40. This Court holds that in an application seeking ad interim injunction
> in a suit for infringement of patent, it would be incumbent on the
> plaintiffs to make a full disclosure of the complete specification of the
> product whose patent is claimed to have been infringed. The plaintiffs will
> also have to disclose to Court the x-ray diffraction data of the product,
> particularly if it is a pharmaceutical drug. The plaintiffs have to make an
> unequivocal disclosure that the patent they hold covers the drug in
> question;
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 44 of 57
> whether there are any other pending applications seeking the grant of patent
> in respect of any derivatives or forms of the product for which they already
> hold a patent and the effect of such applications on the suit patent. Short
> of the above details, the Court being approached for the grant of an ad
> interim relief will be unable to form a view on whether the plaintiff has
> made out a prima facie case. Otherwise it would be a case of suppression of
> material facts that would have a bearing on the question.‖
59\. As noted above, the facts here show that the plaintiffs have been showing
working of IN 229 through TICAGRELOR to the Controller of Patents while filing
Form 27. The plaintiffs have filed proceedings for breach of IN 229 when the
drug in question was TICAGRELOR in USA. These are important facts which have a
material bearing on the issue as to whether TICAGRELOR is disclosed in IN 229
and is known and anticipated. The plaintiffs were obliged to have revealed the
full facts in the plaint. This is especially so, keeping in view the fact that
Micro Labs Ltd. had already filed an application for revocation of the suit
patents before IPAB in 2015 where various grounds were urged including the
fact that the suit patents are disclosed and covered in IN 229. The said
petition clearly states that the compounds as disclosed in IN 907 and IN 984
are known and anticipated in light of IN 229 and could have been developed by
a person skilled in the art. There is clear omission of the plaintiff to
mention these materials and important facts in the plaint.
60\. The above facts, in my opinion, show that the claim of the plaintiff that
TICAGRELOR is not disclosed in IN 229 and is not anticipated is subject to a
strong challenge by the defendant. This is so on account of the admissions
which prima facie the plaintiff have not been able to explain
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 45 of 57 properly. This is also shown on account
of the conduct of the plaintiff as noted above.
(II) Objections under section 3(d) of Patents Act
61\. Another plea strongly raised by the defendant including Dr.Reddy's
Laboratories Ltd. is that TICAGRELOR is derived from a known substance/element
disclosed in IN 229. Being a derivative of a known substance, it is pleaded
that the suit patents are squarely hit by 3(d) of the Patent Act inasmuch as
there is no statement claiming enhanced therapeutic efficacy over IN 229. In
fact it is stated that there is no whisper in the plaint claiming that the
suit patents have enhanced therapeutic efficacy vis-à-vis IN
229\. Hence, it is pleaded that the patent is even otherwise liable to be
revoked.
62\. The plaintiffs have denied the aforesaid submissions. It is stated that
mere structural similarity is not sufficient to trigger Section 3 (d) of the
Act. TICAGRELOR is not a new form or derivative of a known substance. Hence,
it is pleaded that section 3(d) of the Act has no application. It is further
stated that even if for some reason it is held that section 3(d) of the act is
applicable to the present case, it has been pleaded that, TICAGRELOR has a
greater therapeutic efficacy. Reliance is placed on the affidavit of Mr.Robert
Riley which has been filed by the defendant Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. It
is stated that as per the said affidavit, TICAGRELOR has a vastly superior
metabolic establishment which has a direct bearing on the curative effect of
the substance. Hence, it is stated that TICAGRELOR falls outside the scope of
Section 3(d) of the Act.
63\. It is a matter of fact that the plaint is completely silent about any
therapeutic efficacy of the suit patents vis-à-vis IN 229.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 46 of 57
64\. For the sake of completeness, reference may again be had to section 3(d)
of the Patent Act, which reads as follows:
> 3\. What are not inventions. -The following are not inventions within the
> meaning of this Act:-
> xxxxxx [(d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does
> not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the
> mere discovery of any new property or new use for a known substance or of
> the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless such known
> process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.
> Explanation. -For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers,
> polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of
> isomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance
> shall be considered to be the same substance, unless they differ
> significantly in properties with regard to efficacy;]‖
65\. The CIPIH (Commission on Intellectual Property Rights Innovation and
Public Health) describes evergreening as occurring when, ―in the absence of
any apparent additional therapeutic benefits, patent-holders use various
strategies to extend the length of their exclusivity beyond the 20-year patent
term.‖
66\. Reference in this context may again be had to the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Novartis AGs v. Union of India & Ors.(supra). While interpreting
section 3(d) of the Patent Act, the Supreme Court held as follows:
> ―88. We have so far seen Section 3(d) as representing "patentability", a
> concept distinct and separate from "invention". But if Clause (d) is
> isolated from the rest of Section CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 47 of 57 3,
> and the legislative history behind the incorporation of Chapter II in the
> Patents act, 1970, is disregarded, then it is possible to see Section 3(d)
> as an extension of the definition of "invention" and to link Section 3(d)
> with Clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1). In that case, on reading Clauses
> (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) with Section 3(d) it would appear that the Act
> sets different standards for qualifying as "inventions" things belonging to
> different classes, and for medicines and drugs and other chemical
> substances, the Act sets the invention threshold further higher, by virtue
> of the amendments made in Section 3(d) in the year 2005.
> xxxx
> 157\. What is "efficacy"? Efficacy means "the ability to produce a desired
> or intended result". Hence, the test of efficacy in the context of Section
> 3(d) would be different, depending upon the result the product under
> consideration is desired or intended to produce. In other words, the test of

> With regard to the genesis of Section 3(d), and more particularly the

> by the 2005 amendment lays down the condition of "enhancement of the known

> therefore, is that not all CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 48 of 57
> advantageous or beneficial properties are relevant, but only such properties
> that directly relate to efficacy, which in case of medicine, as seen above,
> is its therapeutic efficacy.‖ xxxxx
> 169\. Section 2(1)(j) defines ―invention‖ to mean, ―a new product or ...‖,
> but the new product in chemicals and especially pharmaceuticals may not
> necessarily mean something altogether new or completely unfamiliar or
> strange or not existing before. It may mean something ―different from a

67\. In this context reference may also be had to the judgment of the Division
Bench of this court in F.Hoffman LA Roche Ltd. vs. Cipla Ltd.(supra), where
the court held as follows:
> ―60. The above submissions have been considered. It is not possible to
> accept the contention of the plaintiffs that the Section 3(d) does not bring
> any significant change to the Patents Act. Not only has the substantive
> portion of Section 3(d) indicated a change in 2005 but the Explanation which

CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 49 of 57
> Therefore, unless the enhanced efficacy as mandated by Section 3(d) was
> demonstrated, patent could not have been granted. The defendant has been
> able to show that order of the Controller of Patents was arguably deficient
> on this aspect. The defendant therefore must be taken to have raised a
> credible challenge to the validity of the patent.‖
68\. I have already noted in the above paras the admissions of the plaintiffs
as contained in the Form 27 filed before the concerned authority in India
where the patent IN 229 is shown to be working through TICAGELOR and the
admissions made in the proceedings in the American Court filed against Mylan
INC. Prima facie, I have held that the plaintiffs have not been able to
explain these admissions. It appears that prima facie in the light of the
above facts, the suit patents cannot said to be something altogether new or
completely unfamiliar. The said suit patents would have to pass the test of
enhanced efficacy as provided under section 3(d) read with its explanation.
69\. The plaintiffs had to show compliance of section 3(d) of the Patent Act.
As noted above, the plaint is completely silent about any enhancement of known
therupatic efficacy for the suit patents.
However, plaintiff states that even if for some reason it is held that the
said Section applies, reliance is placed on an affidavit of Dr.Robert J. Riley
which has been filed by the defendant-Dr. Reddy Laboratories Ltd. to state
that IN 907 has better therapeutic efficacy.
70\. This belated reliance of the plaintiffs on the affidavit filed by
Dr.Rober J. Riley does not help the case of the plaintiff. Relevant part of
the affidavit dated 8.3.2000 reads as follows:
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 50 of 57
> ―2. I am aware of both US patent number 6,251,910 (Guile et al) and US
> patent application number 09/508,195 (Hardern etal) that each disclose
> compounds which act as P2T-receptor antagonists. These compounds may be used
> as pharmaceutical agents for Inhibition of platelet aggregation. Both the
> patent (Guile et at) and the patent application (Hardern et at) have been
> assigned to AstraZeneca UK Limited. I am familiar with the compounds
> disclosed and I have been involved in testing and analyzing their biological
> activity.
> xxx
> 10\. For the compounds exemplified in Hardern et al it can be shown that
> these compounds demonstrate the unexpected advantage of being active at a
> lower predicted dose in man as a result of a combination of increased
> metabolic stability together with high affinity for the P2T-receptor.‖
71\. No doubt, the affidavit does state that equivalent of IN 907 (Hardern)
has some advantages over equivalent of IN 229 (Guile). However, it
categorically states that both the compounds, namely, equivalent of IN 229 and
IN 907 can be used as pharmaceutical agents for ―inhibition of platelet
aggregation‖. This view re-inforces my prima facie finding above that the suit
patents are not something altogether new or completely unfamiliar or
unconnected to IN 229.
72\. Coming to the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy, the affidavit of
Dr.Riley states that equivalent of IN 907 shows advantage of a lower
predicated dose and increased metabolic stability. There is no explanation
from the plaintiff as to how the stated advantage, namely, lower dose and
increased metabolic stability would tantamount to enhancement of therapeutic
efficacy over IN 229. As noted by the Supreme Court in the case of Novartis v.
UOI (supra) not all advantageous or beneficial properties are
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 51 of 57 relevant but only such properties that
directly relate to therapeutic efficacy. The belated reliance on the affidavit
of Dr.Riley does not help the case of the plaintiff. Clearly, the plaintiff
have prima facie failed to show enhancement of known efficacy of the suit
patents over the products and fail the test of section 3(d) of the Act.
[III] Non-compliance of Section 8 read with section 64(1)(m) of the Act
73\. Another contention of the defendants is that the plaintiffs have
suppressed the pendency of the litigations in USA, South Korea and China and
that plaintiffs have also suppressed that China Patent application which
corresponds to IN 907 was invalidated on 17.10.2017, European Patent which
corresponds to IN 984 was revoked by EPO on 24.06.2014. Hence, it is pleaded
that the patent is liable to be invalidated under Section 8 and Section
64(1)(m) of the Patent Act.
74\. A Co-Ordinate Bench of this court in Chemtura Corporation v. Union of
India & Ors., 2009 (41) PTC 260 (Del) noted the requirements of section 8 of
the Act stating that section 8 (1) (a) requires an applicant for a patent to
file along with his application a statement setting out the detailed
particulars of the application filed by such applicant ―in any country outside
India in respect of the same or substantially the same invention‖. Section 8
(1) (b) requires such applicant to also furnish an undertaking that up to the
date of the grant of patent in India he will keep the Controller of Patents
informed in writing ―from time to time‖ of detailed particulars as required
under clause (a) in respect of such application made in a country outside
India. The corresponding rule is Rule 12 (1) of the Rules which states that
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 52 of 57 the statement and undertaking to be
filed in terms of Section 8 (1) of the Act will be in Form 3.
75\. In the present case as noted above, the plaintiffs have given reasonable
explanation about the proceedings abroad. It is explained that IN 907 was
revoked in China. However, an appeal was filed and there is an automatic stay
of the operation of the impugned order. Similarly IN 984 was revoked by EPO
and China and an appeal was filed and here there is an automatic stay of the
operations. Equivalent of IN 907 has been granted by 57 countries. Equivalent
to IN 984 has been granted by 55 counties and equivalent to IN 674 have been
granted by 60 countries.
76\. In my opinion, in the given facts there is reasonable disclosure of the
relevant facts in the case. It cannot be said that there has been suppression
of any material facts on this account which have a material bearing on grant
of the injunction application by the plaintiffs to warrant vacation of the
stay order.
77\. The Co-Ordinate Bench of this court in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company &
Ors. v. Mr.J.D.Joshi & Anr.(supra) regarding non-compliance of provisions of
section 8 of the Act, noted as follows:
> Non Compliance of Section 8 ―58. ...... I have gone through the objection
> taken by the defendants as to non compliance of the provisions of Section 8
> of the Act. Although, the said plea raised by the defendants is not argued
> at the time of hearing. Still, I am inclined to deal with it. The provisions
> of Section 8 are already discussed at great length by the courts as such
> wherein the Court may or may not revoke the patent depending upon the nature
> of the information not supplied to the controller, relevance of the
> information and the conduct of the patentee etc......‖ CS(COMM.)749/2018 &
> etc. Page 53 of 57
78\. Reference may also be had to the judgment of this court in the case of
F.HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE LTD & ANR vs. CIPLA LTD., 2015 (225) DLT 391. The Division
Bench of this court noted as follows:-
> ―90. Thus though as a general rule if a consequence is provided then the
> rule has to be interpreted as mandatory however in the present case the
> consequence itself is not mandatory because of use of the word ‗may' in
> Section 64(1). This issue came up for consideration before Division Bench of
> this Court in Maj.(Retd.) Sukesh Behl (supra) wherein this Court held that
> though it is mandatory to comply with the requirement under Section 8(1) of
> the Patents Act and non-compliance of the same is one of the grounds for
> revocation of the patent under Section 64(1)(m), however the use of the word
> ‗may' in Section 64(1) itself indicates the intention of the legislature
> that the power conferred thereunder is discretionary and consequently it is
> necessary for the Court to consider the question as to whether omission on
> the part of the applicant was intentional or whether it was a mere clerical
> and bona-fide error.‖
79\. In my opinion, there is prima facie substantial compliance of the
statutory requirements of Section 8 of the Act by the plaintiffs. The failure
of the plaintiffs to mention about the proceedings in China, proceedings
regarding the European Patent are not material enough to warrant vacation of
the interim orders passed by this court.
[IV] Conclusion
80\. Should the court continue the interim injunction granted earlier?
81\. The Division Bench in F. Hoffmann-LA Roche Ltd. & Ors. vs. Cipla Ltd.
(supra) on this aspect had noted as follows:-
> ―55. The question before this Court is when can it be said that the
> defendant has raised a credible challenge to the validity of a patent held
> by the plaintiff in an infringement action? During the course of the
> argument it was suggested by counsel that the CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page
> 54 of 57 challenge had to be both strong and credible. Also, the defendant
> resisting the grant of injunction by challenging the validity of the patent
> is at this stage required to show that the patent is ―vulnerable‖ and that
> the challenge raises a ―serious substantial question‖ and a triable issue.
> Without indulging in an exercise in semantics, the Court when faced with a
> prayer for grant of injunction and a corresponding plea of the defendant
> challenging the validity of the patent itself, must enquire whether the
> defendant has raised a credible challenge. In other words, that would in the
> context of pharmaceutical products, invite scrutiny of the order granting
> patent in the light of Section 3(d) and the grounds set out in Section 64 of
> the Patents Act 1970. At this stage of course the Court is not expected to
> examine the challenge in any great detail and arrive at a definite finding
> on the question of validity. That will have to await the trial. At the
> present stage of considering the grant of an interim injunction, the
> defendant has to show that the patent that has been granted is vulnerable to
> challenge. Consequently, this Court rejects the contentions of the
> plaintiffs on this issue and affirms the impugned judgment of the learned
> Single Judge.
> xxxxxx
> 85\. To summarise our conclusions:
> xxx
> (vi) Notwithstanding the above, assuming that the plaintiffs held a patent
> for the product which was the subject matter of the suit for infringement,
> the grant of such patent to the plaintiffs will not ipso facto entitle them
> to an interim injunction if the defendant is able to satisfy the court that
> there is a serious question to be tried as to the validity of the patent. In
> the present case, the defendant has raised a credible challenge to the
> validity of the patent by raising a serious triable and substantial question
> that renders it vulnerable to challenge. xxx‖
82\. A Co-Ordinate Bench of this court in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company & Ors.
v. Mr.J.D.Joshi & Anr.(supra) stated as follows:
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 55 of 57
> ―54. It is noteworthy to mention here that the challenges which can be
> raised under the provisions of the Section 64 of the Patents Act 1970 (as
> amended in the year 2005) are in the nature of the questions dependent on
> facts or the mixed question of facts and laws. Where in the case after
> applying the facts in the form of challenge and legal position, it can be
> prima facie readily inferred that the good ground for the challenge is made
> out which raises a credible challenge to the validity of the patent, then
> such inference can be drawn prima facie to state that the credible challenge
> to the validity is raised. As against the same, there are certain questions
> within the challenges which requires the enquiry into more facts or
> complicated questions on which no opinion by the preference one set of facts
> over the other can be formed at the prima facie stage till the time those
> facts are ascertained in the trial as they are disputed question of the
> facts. .......‖
83\. Hence, the legal position as follows is that the grant of patent does not
ipso facto entitle the plaintiff to an interim injunction. If the defendant is
able to show that there exist serious and substantial questions which render
the patent vulnerable to its validity, an injunction may not be granted.
In view of the prima facie finding recorded by me above in Paras I and II, it
is clear that the defendants have raised a strong credible challenge to the
validity of the suit patent under Section 64(1)(f) read with Section 3(d) and
Section 64 (1) (a), 64(1)(d), 64(1)(f) and 64 (1)(k) of the Patent Act. The
issues raised render the suit patents vulnerable to challenge.
84\. In view of the aforementioned reasons, I am of the view that the
plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie case. The balance of
convenience is also in favour of the defendant. This is especially so as the
original patent in question IN 229 has already expired on 14.07.2018.
CS(COMM.)749/2018 & etc. Page 56 of 57
Further, the drugs being sold by the defendants are substantially at a lower
price.
85\. Hence, I vacate the interim order passed by this court on different
dates. The defendants will however continue to maintain correct and true
accounts regarding the sale of the impugned drugs which are sold or dealt by
them in any manner. They will also file quarterly accounts in this court
supported by the affidavit of one of its directors affirming the veracity of
the account. The defendant will also file account statements of sale figures
of the said drug duly authenticated by the chartered accountant of the
defendant on the basis of the records including tax returns.
86\. The applications stand disposed of as above.
