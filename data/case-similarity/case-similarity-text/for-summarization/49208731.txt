    CUSTOMS, EXCISE & SERVICE TAX APPELLATE TRIBUNAL

                    Service Tax Appeal No. 51796 of 2015 [DB]
    [Arising out of Order-in-Appeal No. 1-4/ST/D-1/2015 dated 29.01.2015 passed by
    the Commissioner, CE, Delhi]

    Commissionerate, Delhi-III 37,

WITH Service Tax Appeal No. 52268 of 2015 [DB] & Service Tax Cross Appeal No.
51858 of 2015 [DB] [Arising out of Order-in-Appeal No. DEL-
3\. Rs. 1175000/- in respect of show cause notice dated 20.12.2012
4\. Rs. 57 lacs in respect of show cause notice dated 25.04.2014
18\. The grievance of department in their appeal is that the quantum of
penalty could not have been predetermined and finalized at the time of passing
of order since the penalty has to be calculated with the first date after the
due date till the date of actual payment of outstanding amount of service tax.
But the said contention is opined to be not acceptable. Above all the order
confirming demand is already set aside. The order imposing penalty of any
amount cannot sustain.
19\. In view of entire above discussion, we are of the opinion that the
adjudicating authority below has concluded the erroneous findings. Not only
this, the judicial indiscipline on the part of the authority is very much
apparent. Consequently, we hereby set aside the demand and penalties/interest
not only on the merits thereof but also for the show cause notice being not
maintainable.  14

The show cause notice of 29.09.2010 was earlier assailed before this Tribunal.
Vide final order No. 55142/2017, this Tribunal had remanded the matter back to
the adjudicating authority for denovo adjudication. It is thereafter that the
aforesaid order under challenge  4 ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] was passed not
only with respect to the show cause notice of the year 2010 but with respect
to the subsequent three show cause notices as well.
3\. We have heard Shri T.R. Rustagi, learned Advocate for the Appellant and
Shri Vivek Pandey, learned DR for the Department. It is submitted on behalf of
the Appellant that :
> (1) There is no classification of the taxable services given in the later 4
> SCNs.
> (2) The later 4 SCNs are entirely based on balance-sheet figures without any
> investigation being conducted. (3) There are case laws which suggests that
> show cause notices based only on balance sheet figures cannot stand in law.
> (4) Place of provision of service rules have not been quoted in the later 4
> show cause notices.
> (5) Negative list provisions have not been quoted in the show-
cause-notices.
4\. It is also submitted that Chartered Accountant certificate was given which
has not been considered by the Adjudicating Authority. Learned Counsel has
relied upon the decision of Commissioner Central Excise, Patna vs. Universal
Polythylene Industries reported as 2011 (270) ELT 168 (Pat) to impress upon
that balance sheet shall not prevail in case of conflict between the balance
sheet and the returns filed. Reliance has also been placed on the decision of
Tribunal, Mumbai in the case of Raymond Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Service Tax,
Mumbai-ii reported as 2018 (19) GSTL 270 to impress upon that the amount
deducted in foreign currency from export proceed on account of collection
charges of  5 ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] foreign bank are not taxable at the
hands of Indian recipients in as much as such changes were not directly
collected from him by the foreign bank. Finally, laying emphasis upon the
decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise,
Bangalore Vs Brindavan Beverages Pvt. Ltd. reported as 2007 (213) ELT 487 that
if the allegations in show cause notice are not specific, the same is
sufficient to hold that noticee was not given proper opportunity to meet the
allegations in the said show cause notice, the Appellant has prayed for the
appeal filed by them to be allowed and the crossed appeal filed by the
department objecting the quantum of penalty under Section 76 of Finance Act,
1962 to be dismissed.
5\. Per contra learned DR has submitted that infact Appellant failed to
provide the relevant evidence despite demand from the department. It is due to
lack of such evidence that the adjudicating authority below has decided the
appeal confirming the proposed demand. The meticulous and detailed reasoning
by the Adjudicating authority with respect to as many as 11 services is
impressed upon for order-under-challenge to be a justified one. Appeal filed
by the Appellant is accordingly prayed to be dismissed. Simultaneously, it is
impressed upon that the quantum of penalty imposed by the Adjudicating
authority is not in consonance with the provision i.e. Section 76 of the
Finance Act that the appeal of the department is prayed to be allowed.
6\. After hearing the rival contentions of the parties and perusing the entire
record, we foremost deem it necessary to reproduce the  6 ST-51796-51858 of
2015 [DB] necessary legal provisions about the services involved herein. The
same reads as follows:
> S65(105) "taxable service" means any 1[service provided or to be provided],-
> 1\. Renting of Immovable Property service : (zzzz)5[to any person, by any
> other person, by renting of immovable property to any other service in
> relation to such renting for use in the course of or, for furtherance of
> business commerce.]
> 2\. Scientific & technical consultancy service: (za) to a client, by a
> scientist or technocrat or any science or technology institution or
> organisation, in relation to scientific or technical consultancy;
> 3\. Business Auxiliary Service :
> (zzb) to a client, by8[any person] in relation to business auxiliary
> service;
> 4\. Scientific & technical consultancy service: (zzh) to any person, by a
> technical testing and analysis agency, in relation to technical testing and
> analysis;
> 5\. Business consultancy service :
> (r) [to any person] by a management or business consultant in connection
> with the management of any organization or [business,]* in any manner;]
> 6\. Advertisement Service :
> (e)[to any person], by an advertising agency in relation to advertisement,
> in any manner;
> 7\. Marketing research Agency Service :
> (y)[to any person], by a market research agency in relation to market
> research of any product, service or utility, in any manner;
> 8\. Convention Service :
> (zc)[to any person], by any 3[person] in relation to holding of convention,
> in any manner;
> 9\. IPR Service :
> (zzr) to any person, by the holder of intellectual property right, in
> relation to intellectual property service;
> 10\. Commercial Coaching & Training Service : (zzc) to any person, by a
> commercial training or coaching centre in relation to commercial training or
> coaching;
> 11\. Banking & other Financial Services :
> [(zm)4[to any person], by a banking company or a financial institution
> including a non-banking financial company or any other body corporate 5 [or
> commercial concern], in relation to banking and other financial services;]
7\. From the order in original dated 29.01.2015 as has been challenged in the
impugned appeals, we observe that demand has been confirmed on the following
grounds :
7
ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB]
(i) R&D Income (under Scientific & technical consultancy service): service
provided by the appellant to M/s Solvey that all the conditions of export as
per rule 3(1)(iii) of the Export of Service Rules, 2005.
(ii) The demand with respect to lease rent income know-how fee, professional
and consultancy expenses has been confirmed for want of any supporting
evidence. In this respect, we observe that demand on all above accounts has
been raised based on the details of the balance sheet which are contrary to
the details of the returns. Appellants have placed on record the Chartered
Accountant certificate acknowledging that the statements showing amount of
expenses booked as accruals in foreign currency are verified by the Chartered
Accountant to have been prepared by them. The procedure performed has also
been specified in the said certificate with the clarification that the
expenses do not include any such expenses which are to be paid in Indian
currency. But the original adjudicating authority has not relied upon this
certificate. Nothing has been specified in order under challenge as what is
the evidence available on record to falsify the said certificate. Thus the
findings that there is no other evidence than balance sheets which reflect the
alleged short payment on part of the Appellant is opined to be a decision
contrary to the law as has already been settled that there is no proposition
of law for balance sheet to prevail in case of conflict between balance sheet
prepared by a professional Chartered Accountant and RT-  8
> ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] 12 Returns. The Hon'ble High Court at Patna in
> the case of Commissioner Central Excise, Patna Vs. Universal Polyethylene
> reported as 2011 (270) ELT 168 has held that in case of such conflict facts
> and circumstances of the case are to be considered. Since both are the
> pieces of evidence thus which deserve acceptance is to be decided on the
> basis of further evidence available. The SLP against this judgement of High
> Court was dismissed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court in CCE, Patna Vs. Universal
> Polythylene reported as 2016 (342) ELT A226 Recent Tribunal Mumbai in Kamboj
> Ispat P. Ltd. & Shri Chatar Singh Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise,
> Mumbai-2016(1) TMI 560-CESTAT Mumbai, it was held that show cause notice
> based only on balance sheet figures is not sustainable in law. The Tribunal
> ruled that the department has to prove the allegation of evasion of duty by
> tangible evidence.
> 8\. The burden was on the Revenue to prove the alleged shortcoming after the
> records of Appellant along with their C.A. certificate was already produced
> before the adjudicating authority. In the given circumstances, neglecting
> those evidences and without referring to any other evidence proving short
> payment on part of Appellant, confirmation of demand to our opinion is not
> sustainable. The same is to be set aside.
9\. Coming to the plea that a show cause notice dated 20.10.2008 cannot be
referred to as "the previous" show cause notice for proposing the demand in
impugned four show cause notices,  9 ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] appellants
had submitted that no elaborate basis of charge was given in any of the
subsequent show cause notices except making a reference to the previous show
cause notice of 20.10.2008. No scrutiny of record was done nor any document
was examined. The demand is alleged to have been mechanically raised by simply
ascertaining that the difference between the tax payable on balance sheet
figures of income/expenditure and the tax paid as per ST-3 Returns is alleged
to have been evaded that too by suppression of facts.
10\. We observe that there is no denial of the department about Appellants to
have provided the information as was demanded by the department about the
income earned and expenses incurred for the period in question.
11\. Perusal of four of these show cause notices shows that nothing has
precisely been discussed in the show cause notice for the impugned period. All
these show cause notices are speaking about the records from 01.04.2009 to
31.03.2010 which apparently and admittedly is not the period of demand in any
of these show cause notices. The show cause notices are opined to be vague. We
draw our support from the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Brindavan Beverages (supra) wherein show cause notice is held to be the
foundation for the Department to have built up the case. Any lack of detail
therein amounts to denial of opportunity to the assessee to meet the
allegations.
12\. Though the department has laid emphasis upon the Finance Act 2012,
Section 73 thereof, but we are of the opinion that the said legal  10
ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] provisions for treating a subsequent show cause
notice as continuation of the previous show cause notice where issue remains
same, came only in the year 2012. The same cannot be made applicable
retrospectively. Thus, we are of the opinion that each show cause notice had
to be self contained, including all the details and basis for arriving at the
allegation of short/non-payment of service as already observed above. Thus two
of the SCNs are out of the scope of this provision. SCN of 2014 could rely
upon the contents of the SCN of the year 2012 but later also a no detail
except reliance upon SCN of 2008 which is not permissible for the reason
stated above. Resultantly, all four SCNs here are silent providing any basis
to proceed against the appellant.
13\. Otherwise also legal provisions for charging service tax on export of
services cited in the previous SCN of 20.10.2008 have no relevance for
subsequent period for the reasons elaborated below :
(i) Export of service was determined by the Export of Service Rules, 2005,
effective from 15.03.2005. They were amended more than once.
(ii) Subsequently, there were replaced by the Place of Provision of Services
Rules, 2012, effective from 01.07.2012 that determined when a service can be
said to be imported or exported.
(iii) Thus the legal basis of demanding tax on the interpretation that a
service was not exported mentioned in the SCN of 20.10.2008 did not apply at
all to the subsequent show cause notices.
11
ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] Also there was change in the procedure relating to
the point of payment of tax because :
(i) Before 01.04.2011, the service tax was payable on the amount of payment
"received" in the given month. From 01.04.2011, the tax became payable on the
amount "billed" that is on the value of service „provided‟ in the month, Rule
6 of the Service Tax Rules, 1944. Above all cases the facts stated in the
prevsious SCN did not apply to subsequent notice due to the reason that :
(i) In the present case some vital facts also changed. For example, in
2012-13, the export of R&D service was provided to Osmotica Kereskedeimis of
Hungary [ref: para 121.2 at page 218], an altogether different company than
Solvey Pharmaceuticals of Netherlands [ref: para 14 at page 107] to who the
export of R&D was made in 2003-04 to 2008-09. The terms of contract were
different. Therefore, no reliance can be placed upon the reasoning of the
contract of „Solvey‟ to the export made in 2012-13.
(ii) In the previous notice in respect of the allegation of non-
> payment of service tax on renting, the reference was to income earned from
> renting of immovable property. This is not the case in subsequent notices.
> In these notices the reference is to income from residential flat renting.
> The legal provisions are different for these two.
14\. None of the show cause notice confirms the said criteria above all four
of these show cause notices involved the period prior  12 ST-51796-51858 of
2015 [DB] the aforesaid amendments. Hence, this amendment is of no benefit to
the department in impugned case.
15\. We further that Tribunal, vide final order No. 55142/2017 vide which the
appeal of the present assessee with respect to the earlier Order dated
24.12.2010 was allowed, had while remanding the matter held as follows:
> 1\. If the beneficiary of taxable service is situated abroad then the
> service provider under the export service rules should qualify him under
> "export of service" for the purpose of tax liability. Decision of Hon'ble
> Apex court in the case of All India Federation of Tax Practitioners vs.
> Union of India reported 2007(7) STR (625) (SC) was relied upon.
> 2\. With respect to other services provided by the assessee within the
> country, the adjudicating authority was directed to verify the payment
> particulars need by the Appellant.
16\. The order under challenge is the outcome of the said remand not only for
the show cause notice under adjudication in the said order but to the
subsequent three show cause notices. As already observed above these
subsequent show cause notices have no specific allegation for the period
therein. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the order under challenge has
actually not complied with the directions of said verification s. Lack of
evidence in the given circumstances is held to be erroneous ground to confirm
the demand as the evidence to be verified has been observed to be already
available on record.  13
ST-51796-51858 of 2015 [DB] Thus seen from the above discussion, the order
confirming the demand as proposed by four separate show cause notices is
erroneous is rather contrary to the settled case law and the evidence on the
record.
17\. Coming to the scope of appeal filed by the department, it is observed
that the challenge in the said appeal is very narrow confining to the quantum
of penalty imposed under Section 76. It is observed that the order-under-
challenge has imposed the following penalties:
1\. Rs. 5 lace in respect of show cause notice dated 29.09.2010.

4\. Rs. 57 lacs in respect of show cause notice dated 25.04.2014
18\. The grievance of department in their appeal is that the quantum of
penalty could not have been predetermined and finalized at the time of passing
of order since the penalty has to be calculated with the first date after the
due date till the date of actual payment of outstanding amount of service tax.
But the said contention is opined to be not acceptable. Above all the order
confirming demand is already set aside. The order imposing penalty of any
amount cannot sustain.
19\. In view of entire above discussion, we are of the opinion that the
adjudicating authority below has concluded the erroneous findings. Not only
this, the judicial indiscipline on the part of the authority is very much
apparent. Consequently, we hereby set aside the demand and penalties/interest
not only on the merits thereof but also for the show cause notice being not
maintainable.  14
