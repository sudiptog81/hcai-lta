    PER SUSHMA CHOWLA, JM:
           The     appeal     filed   by     the   Revenue       is   against     the    order    of
CIT(A)-V, Pune, both dated 14.03.2014 relating to assessment year 2008-09
against order passed under section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (in
short 'the Act').
The assessee has also filed its Cross Objections against the appeal filed by
the Revenue.
2\. The appeal filed by the Revenue and Cross Objections filed by the assessee
were heard together and are being disposed of by this consolidated order for
the sake of convenience.
3\. The Revenue in ITA No.1 375/PN/2014 has raised the following grounds of
appeal:-
> 1\. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law,
> the CIT(A) is justified in accepting the average profit margin @ 20% as
> against the average margin of profit at 10.6% taken by the A.O. for
> calculating the deduction u/s 10B of the Act?
> 2\. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law,
> the CIT(A) is justified in restricting the disallowance u/s 10B, by
> considering the locational saving in respect of axle plant, without
> appreciating the fact that the argument regarding locational advantage put
> forth by the assessee company before the CIT(A) in the course of appellate
> proceedings and was not placed before the AO during assessment proceedings?
4\. The assessee in CO No.86/PN/2014 has raised the following grounds of
objections:-
> On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law
> 1\. The learned CIT (A) erred in curtailing the deduction claimed by the
> cross objector under Section 10B of Income Tax Act 1961 in respect of profit
> derived from manufacture and exports of light axle components on selective
> basis by taking for comparison an adhoc benchmark profit mark up of 20% and
> in doing so confirming the resort of the AO to the provisions of section 10B
> (7) read with 80lA (l0) and thereby disallowing the deduction of profit
> claimed to the extent of Rs.4,12,00,000/- allegedly as being profit in
> excess of expected ordinary profits.
3
> ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
> 2\. The learned CIT (A) in confirming the aforesaid disallowance failed to
> appreciate that substitution of third party costs to rework profit mark up
> in the case of light axle components manufactured and sold by the cross
> objector in its 10B undertaking led to absurd results due to artificial
> inflation of cost base of the cross objector especially when the export
> sales price was fixed and unchanged. The learned CIT (A) failed to
> appreciate that the transactions with Associated Enterprise (AE) of the
> cross objector viz. export sales from the 10B undertaking had been accepted
> to be at Arm's length Price (ALP) by the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) and
> therefore the AO was bound by the order of the TPO as mandated by the
> provisions of Section 92CA(4).
> 3\. The learned CIT(A) further erred in reducing the deduction claimed by
> the cross objector under section 10B on selective basis in case of exports
> of light axle components only when the mark up earned by the cross objector
> in case of manufacture and exports of propeller shaft components exported
> from the 10B undertakings was accepted by the TPO/AO after duly considering
> the effect of locatinal savings in the indicative profit mark up given by
> the outside Transfer Pricing Sonsultant.
5\. The issue raised in the appeal filed by the Revenue and Cross Objections
filed by the assessee is in respect of claim of deduction under section 10B of
the Act.
6\. The learned Authorized Representative for the assessee pointed out that
the Revenue is in appeal against the order of CIT(A) in allowing the said
relief partially and the assessee has filed the Cross Objections vis-à-vis
claim of deduction under section 10B of the Act not being allowed by the
CIT(A) in respect of profits derived from exports of light axle components
made to associate enterprises. It was further pointed out by him that the
issue raised in present appeal of the Revenue and Cross Objections is squarely
covered by the order of Tribunal in assessee's own case relating to assessment
years 2006-07 and 2007-08. He further pointed out that the assessee had
claimed deduction under section 10B of the Act against manufacture and export
of propeller Shafts and light axle components. The Transfer Pricing Officer
(TPO) had accepted the cost plus margins method and has also accepted the
exports to associate enterprises at arm's length price. However, the deduction
claimed under section 10B of the Act was curtailed by invoking the provisions
of section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act for higher mark up of 28.13% in
the case of profits shown at Chakan plant, Pune for export of light axle
components vis-à-vis the  4 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India
Ltd.
average profit mark up of 10.6% of external overseas comparables. The
deduction under section 10B of the Act was disallowed only in respect of
profits from export of light axle components.
7\. The learned Departmental Representative for the Revenue on the other hand,
placed reliance on the orders of Assessing Officer and CIT(A).
8\. Briefly, in the facts of the case, the assessee was engaged in the
business of manufacture of drive train components, namely shafts, universal
joints, axles and components thereof, which constitute heart of the
transmission system. The assessee was set up as a joint venture company by
Anand Group of companies and Dana Corporation, USA. The assessee had set up
the unit to manufacture assembly/components of propeller shafts at Jodalli,
Karnataka, assembly / components of propeller shafts at Hosur in Karnataka and
assembly / components of propeller shafts and fully assembled propeller shafts
at Satara in Maharashtra.
Further, it manufactures axles and assembly of axles at Chakan, Pune. The
export of assessee company was to Dana group, in addition to local sales of
fully assembled propeller shafts and axles to OEMs in India. For the year
under consideration, the assessee had furnished the return of income declaring
nil income. The total turnover of the assessee was Rs.628 crores, on which
book profits of Rs.59 crores was shown. Out of total turnover of Rs.628
crores, export turnover was Rs.206 crores, out of which the export from 10B
units was Rs.184 crores and the balance exports from domestic units, which
were non 10B units. The assessee had declared book profits of 10B units at
Rs.35 crores. The Assessing Officer made a reference under section 92CA(1) of
the Act to the TPO for computation of arm's length price in relation to
international transaction undertaken by the assessee. The TPO vide its order
passed under section 92CA(3) of the Act, dated 13.10.2011 accepted the  5 ITA
No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
international transaction of the assessee to be at arm's length price and
proposed no adjustment to the value of international transaction entered into
by the assessee.
The Assessing Officer while computing the income in the hands of assessee,
referred to the provisions of section 10B(7) of the Act and show caused the
assessee to explain as to why it had shown disproportionately higher profit
margins on 10B units as compared with domestic sales and comparables in TP
benchmarking report and had further claimed higher deduction from its profits.
The reply of the assessee is incorporated at pages 10 to 12 of the assessment
order. The Assessing Officer accepted the first plea of the assessee that the
profit margins on domestic sales could not be compared with margins of export
sales since the domestic sales were to OEMs and were of fully assembled
propelled shafts and fully assembled axles, unlike export to Dana Corporation,
which was only components propeller shafts and axles.
The next contention of the assessee that there was no close connection between
the assessee and Dana Corporation was rejected and also the contention of
assessee was that where the TPO had accepted the transaction with it associate
enterprises in all the years and no adjustment had been made, then no
disallowance could be made under section 10B of the Act, was not accepted by
the Assessing Officer.
Accepting the plea of the assessee that cost plus mark-up basis should be
applied for comparison, the other plea of the assessee that it had similar
profit margins as other concerns in market was not accepted as the assessee
had not compared and shown the profit margins / cost plus mark-up on export
sales to associate enterprises.
Another argument raised by the assessee before the Assessing Officer was that
the profit margins of exports had remained in the same range both before 10B
units were set up and after it. The Assessing Officer observed that the
assessee had incurred losses in the earlier years and deduction under section
10B of the Act was claimed only after the set up of said unit and the said
unit was showing profitability. The Assessing Officer further compared the
profit margins of assessee with the set of  6 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO
No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
comparable results and pointed out that the profit margins of assessee in case
of light axle components export by it were high. The Assessing Officer was of
the view that mark-up of 10.6% in case of Axle was an indicator of normal
profit. However, the assessee had declared a mark-up of 28.13% and the
Assessing Officer held that the selling price between closely related
enterprises was structured to give rise to very high profit to the assessee in
case of exports of axle components, since the profit of 10B unit was tax
deductible. The assessee admittedly, was not paying royalty on exports and
warranty liability borne by Dana Corporation in respect of exports, the
Assessing Officer re-computed the deduction under section 10B of the Act and
disallowed sum of Rs.9.30 crores.
9\. The CIT(A) upheld the order of Assessing Officer. However, accepted the
plea of assessee for the proposition that there was locational advantage in
case of both manufacturing of axle components and propelled shaft components.
Where the assessee had accepted the locational advantage in the case of
propelled shafts, the CIT(A) held that it could not be said that there was no
locational advantage in the case of axles. Accordingly, the CIT(A) was of the
view that 20% profit margins would take care of locational advantage as well
as other issues like warranty claims, etc and accordingly, excess deduction
under section 10B of the Act was worked out and the addition was scaled down
to Rs.4.12 cores.
10\. The Revenue is in appeal against the order of CIT(A) and the assessee has
filed Cross Objections against the same.
11\. The issue arising in the present appeal is the claim of deduction under
section 10B of the Act in respect of profits of EOU units, wherein the
assessee had made exports to its associate enterprises and had declared
margins of 28.13% in its unit of  7 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014
Spicer India Ltd.
manufacture and export of axle components established at Chakan, Pune. The
Assessing Officer had compared the margins of assessee by adopting cost plus
method with the margins of comparable external cases as per E and Y transfer
pricing reports submitted by the assessee at 10.6% being the indicator of
normal profit. The assessee had claimed deduction under section 10B of the Act
in respect of unit of axle components at Rs.14.92 crores and the same was
curtailed by the authorities below. On the other hand, 10B deduction claimed
by the assessee in respect of manufacture and export of propelled shafts
components at Jodalli and Hosur, Karnataka at Rs.19.37 crores was accepted by
the authorities below. The case of the authorities below was that the assessee
had shown more than ordinary profits in its unit at Chakan, Pune in order to
claim higher deduction under section 10B of the Act, which was to be curtailed
based on the provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act . The
issue which arises before us is that can 10B deduction claimed by the assessee
under the Act be curtailed by invoking the provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s.
80IA(10) of the Act on the premise that the assessee had earned higher profits
than normal on exports made to its associate enterprises. At this juncture, it
may be pointed out that against the reference made by the Assessing Officer
under section 92CA(1) of the Act, the TPO vide order passed under section
92CA(3) of the Act had held that the arm's length price of international
transaction between the assessee and its associate enterprises was nil.
In other words, the international transaction undertaken by the assessee by
way of exports from its EOU unit was accepted by the TPO and no adjustment was
made on the aforesaid international transaction. However, the Assessing
Officer while computing the income in the hands of assessee was of the view
that on similar profits earned by the assessee in respect of its EOU unit,
where exports were made by it to its associate enterprises, the assessee had
earned higher profits than normal on such exports.

12\. The Pune Bench of Tribunal in M/s. Honeywell Automation India Ltd. Vs.
DCIT in ITA No.18/PN/2011, relating to assessment year 2006 -07, order dated
25.02.2015 while deciding the issue of claim of deduction under section 10A of
the Act vis -à-vis provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act had
deliberated upon the issue at length and had held that the provisions of
section 10A(7) of the Act were attracted where closely connected parties were
taxable in India. The Tribunal vide order dated 25.02.2015 (supra) further
held as under:-
> "22. Before we proceed further, it would be appropriate to examine the scope
> and intent of the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80-IA(10) of the Act.
> In this context, a reference has been made to the CBDT Circular No.308 dated
> 29.06.2008 wherein the reasons for introduction of sub-section (7) to
> section 10A of the Act has been explained. In-particular, reference has been
> made to the following contents of the Circular :-
> "The provisions of sub-section (8) and sub-section (9) of section 80-I will
> also apply in relation to the industrial undertaking referred to in the new
> section 10A as they apply in relation to an industrial undertaking referred
> to under section 80-I. Under the applied sub-section (8) of section 80-I, it
> is provided that where an Assessee has several units, some in the free trade
> zone and some outside, the profits of the unit in the free trade zone will
> be computed after taking the cost of the goods transferred to or from the
> unit on the basis of the market value of such goods. The applied sub-section
> (9) of section 80-I empowers the Income-tax Officer to determine the
> reasonable profits that could be attributed to the qualifying undertaking in
> the free trade zone in cases where, owing to the close connection between
> the Assessee and any other persons or for any other reason, the course of
> the business is so arranged that the industrial undertaking set up in the
> free trade zone derives more than ordinary profits which may be expected to
> arise in that business. This provision has been made with a view to avoiding
> abuse of the new tax concessions by manipulation of profits between
> associate concerns or different units of the same concern."
> [underlined for emphasis by us]
> 23\. Quite clearly, the provisions of section 10A(7) of the Act intend to
> plug abuse of tax concession by manipulation of profits between associated
> concerns or between different units of the same concern. The objective of
> the aforesaid Provision is that the tax concessions are not abused by
> manipulation of profits. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid
> explanation in the CBDT Circular (supra) signifies the legislative intent
> and it is also manifested in the language of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -
> IA(10) of the Act. We say so for the reason that the phraseology of section
> 80-IA(10) of the Act itself suggests that the profits and gains of an
> eligible business cannot be tinkered with by the Assessing Officer merely
> because they are more than the ordinary profits or that they are quite high.
> The existence of substantial or more than ordinary profits by itself does
> not sufficiently empower the Assessing Officer to disregard them and
> determine the profits which he may consider to be reasonably deemed to have
> been derived therefrom. The presence of the expression "the course of
> business ............ is so arranged ............. that the business
> transacted ............... produces to the assessee more than ordinary
> profits" is significant and its understanding has to be prefaced by the
> legislative objective of plugging abuse of the tax concessions granted u/s
> 10A of the Act by manipulation of profits between  9 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO
> No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
> associated parties. In other words, the import of the expression "so
> arranged" has to be read in conjunction with the legislative intent that
> there should not be any abuse of tax concession by manipulation of profits.
> Therefore, section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act can be invoked only
> where it is shown that the course of business is so arranged which reflects
> an abuse of tax concession whereby the business transacted between two
> entities is so arranged, which produces to the assessee more than the
> ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in such eligible business.
> The emphasis is to eschew those 'more than the ordinary profits' which are
> as a result of a business between two closely connected concerns having been

> present case, the Revenue would have to justify that the course of business

> produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be
> expected to arise in such eligible business with the intention of abusing

> (i) a close connection between the assessee and the other person; and, (ii)
> more than ordinary profits is not sufficient to justify invoking of section
> 80-IA(10) of the Act in the absence of there being any material to say that
> the course of business between them is "so arranged" to abuse the tax

> the expression "so arranged" has to be understood in the context of the
> abuse of tax concession which is sought to be plugged by the provisions of
> section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act."
13\. The other aspect noted by the Tribunal was the arrangement between the
parties for earning more than ordinary profits wherein onus was upon the
Department to prove that an arrangement existed. The findings of the Tribunal
are as under :-
> "30. Now, the case of the Assessing Officer is that the profits derived by
> the assessee from the eligible business are more than the ordinary profits
> and therefore he is empowered to arrive at what could be a reasonable profit
> from such eligible business and such profit be taken as reasonably deemed to
> have been derived from the eligible business for the purposes of computing
> the deduction u/s 10A of the Act. We find that in the entire assessment
> order, there is no material or any evidence which has been brought out to

> enterprises has been so arranged that the business transacted has produced
> to the assessee more than the ordinary profits.
> 31\. No doubt, there is a close connection between assessee and the
> associated enterprises and to that extent section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10)
> of the Act has been rightly examined by the income-tax authorities. The

> Assessing Officer. There is no material or evidence referred to in the

> However, from the side of the Revenue, it was pointed out that the Transfer

business between the assessee and the associated enterprises has been so
arranged, so as to result in 'more than the ordinary profits' within the
meaning of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act. In this context, we
may refer to the decision of the Chennai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
Visual Graphics Computing Services India (P) Ltd. vs. ACIT, 148 TTJ 621
(Chennai), wherein following discussion is relevant :-
> "We heard both sides in detail and considered the issue. As far as the
> present case is concerned, the Transfer Pricing Officer has made a
> categorical finding that the operating profit reported by the assessee is
> higher than the profit worked out on the basis of arm's length price. The
> Transfer Pricing Officer, therefore, concluded that no transfer pricing
> adjustment is called for in the present case. The Assessing Officer has made
> the reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer under section 92CA. The
> reference is made for the purpose of computing income arising from an
> international transaction with regard to the arm's length price as provided
> in section 92. Therefore, it is to be seen that the scope and extent of
> reference made by the Assessing Officer to the Transfer Pricing Officer is
> confined to the singular purpose stated in section
> 92\. Sections 92A, 92B, 92C, 92CB, 92D, 92E and section 92F are all
> precisely defining and facilitating provisions ultimately for the purpose of
> computing the income as stated in section 92. All the above stated sections
> provided in Chapter X of the Income-tax Act, 1961 belong to a separate code
> as such, enacted for the purpose of computing income from international
> transactions having regard to the arm's length price so as to confirm that
> there is no avoidance of tax by an assessee. Therefore, where in a case, the
> Transfer Pricing Officer suggests that the operating profit declared by an
> assessee is compatible to the arm's length price norms and no adjustment is
> necessary, the operation of all those provisions come to an end. If the,
> Assessing Officer has to make any other adjustment towards computing
> deduction available under section 10A, the computation has to be made in the
> context of section 10A(7) read with section 80-IA(10).

14\. The said proposition laid down by the Pune Bench of Tribunal in M/s.
Honeywell Automation India Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra) was applied by Pune Bench of
12 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
Tribunal in assessee's own case while deciding the issue of grant of deduction
under section 10B of the Act, wherein the Commissioner while exercising the
powers under section 263 of the Act had held that where the assessee had shown
more than ordinary profits in respect of export of its EOU unit were to be
curtailed in view of the provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the
Act. The asses see filed an appeal against the order of Commissioner under
section 263 of the Act and the Tribunal in ITA No.1 112/PN/2012 in assessee's
own case relating to assessment year 2006-07 vide order dated 08.07.2015 noted
the factual aspects of the case and applied the ratio laid down by the
Tribunal in the case of M/s. Honeywell Automation India Ltd.
Vs. DCIT (supra) and held that the provisions of section 10B of the Act are
parametria to the provisions of section 10A of the Act, the propositions
proposed by the Commissioner were mis-placed in holding that the provisions of
section 10B(7) of the Act are applicable and 10B deduction claimed could be
curtailed. The relevant findings of the Tribunal read as under:-
> "15. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the record. The issue
> arising in the present appeal filed by the assessee is against the invoking
> of jurisdiction by the Commissioner under section 263 of the Act in holding
> that the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer was without any

> accepted to be at arm's length price by the Transfer  13 ITA No.1375/PN/2014
> CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
Pricing Officer, without making any adjustment. The TPO had not given any
finding that the profit mark-up on cost, reported by the assessee, in its
transaction with its AE was in excess of the profit mark-up of external
comparables. In the absence of any adjustments having been made by the
Transfer Pricing Officer, the Assessing Officer had to accept the order of the
TPO as mandated by the provisions of section 92CA(4) of the Act, wherein the
TPO had accepted the exports and other international transactions with the AE
to be at arm's length price without any adjustment. The Assessing Officer in
consequence determined the income of the assessee inconformity with the order
of the TPO. The issue arising before us in such circumstances is that where
the assessee had claimed deduction under section 10B of the Act on such
exports to its AE, can the same be curtailed by invoking the provisions of
section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act on the premise that the assessee had
earned higher profits than normal on exports made to its AEs.
17\. In the facts before the Tribunal in M/s Honeywell Automation India
Limited vs. DCIT (supra), the dispute arose vis-à-vis the entitlement of the
assessee for the claim of deduction under section 10A of the Act which was
curtailed based on the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the
Act. The TPO in the said case had restricted the profits eligible for the
claim of deduction under section 10A of the Act, as the profits in relation to
the 10A units were more than the ordinary profits. The Assessing Officer
accordingly re-computed the amounts of profit which he considered as
reasonable to have been derived in terms of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of
the Act. The assessee in its Transfer Pricing Study in the said case had
benchmarked the international transaction by selecting the TNM Method. The TPO
on a reference by the Assessing Officer passed an order under section 92CA(3)
of the Act accepting the international transaction with respect to the
software engineering services segment to be at arm's length. However, the
Assessing Officer was of the view that the profit margins in respect of the
10A unit was substantially higher than the profit margin of the comparables
chosen by the assessee while carrying out the comparability analysis under the
TNM Method and therefore according to him the profits declared by the assessee
in the 10A units was not the ordinary profits and had to be restricted under
section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act.
18\. We find that similar issue for grant of deduction u/s 10A of the Act by
invoking provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act, arose
before the Tribunal in assessee's own case relating to assessment year 2006-07
(supra). The Tribunal had considered the provisions of section 10A(7) of the
Act and it was observed that the said provisions are attracted where closely
connected party are taxable in India. In this regard, the relevant portions of
the order of the Tribunal dated 25.02.2015 (supra) read as under :-
> "7. Before proceeding further, we may briefly touch-upon the relevant
> provisions of the Act, which have a bearing on the controversy before us.
> Sub-section (7) of section 10A of the Act reads as under :-
> "(7) The provisions of sub-section (8) and sub-section (10) of section 80-IA
> shall, so far as may be, apply in relation to the undertaking referred to in
> this section as they apply for the purposes of the undertaking referred to

> 8\. Further, sub-sections (8) and (10) of section 80-IA of the Act referred

> "(8) Where any goods [or services] held for the purposes of the eligible

9\. Section 10A of the Act is a special provision in respect of newly
established undertakings in free trade zone, etc.. Section 10A postulates a
deduction of such profits and gains as are derived by an undertaking from the
export of articles or things or computer software for a period of ten
assessment years beginning with the assessment year relevant to the previous
year in which the undertaking begins to manufacture or produce such articles
or things or computer software, as the case may be, while computing the total
income of an assessee. Shorn of other details, for the present it would
suffice to note that the three units of the assessee, namely, Unit No.I & II
at Pune and Unit at Chennai are recognized as STPI Units in accordance with
the Software Technology Park Scheme of the Government of India and they are
eligible for the benefits of section 10A of the Act.
10\. The bone of contention in the present case between the assessee and the
Revenue is invoking of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act. Section
80-IA(10) of the Act, reproduced above, empowers the Assessing Officer to re-
compute the profits and gains of the eligible business for the purposes of
deduction u/s 10A of the Act if it appears to him that the profits declared by
the assessee are more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to
arise in such an eligible business. So however, the aforesaid power of the
Assessing Officer is subject to the pre-requisites contained in sub-section
(10) of section 80-IA of the Act itself. The circumstances in which such a
course is available to the Assessing Officer is contained in section 80-IA(10)
itself. A perusal of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act would show
that the two essential conditions are to be established before the Assessing
Officer can proceed to disregard the profits declared by the assessee and
determine the amount of profits which may reasonably deemed to have been
derived from such business. Notably, such conditions are (i) existence of a
close connection between the assessee carrying on eligible business and any
other person; and, (ii) that the course of business is so arranged that the
business transacted produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits.
11\. At the outset, it is to be noted that the opening sentence in section 80-
IA(10) of the Act contains the expression - "where it appears to the Assessing
Officer that ............". This would show that the onus is on the  15 ITA
No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
Assessing Officer to justify invoking of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of
the Act, having regard to the facts circumstances of a given case. Evidently,
the primary rule of evidence is that "what is apparent is real" unless proved
otherwise by the person alleging it so. Ostensibly, if the Assessing Officer
is to invoke the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act
then the onus is on him to justify such invocation having regard to the cogent
material and evidence on record. On this aspect of the matter, there was no
dispute between the rival counsels inasmuch as the Ld. CIT-DR quite fairly
agreed that the onus was on the Assessing Officer to justify invoking of
section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act in the facts of a given case.
Nevertheless, on this aspect, we may also make a reference to the judgement of
the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of CIT vs. H.P. Global Soft Ltd.,
342 ITR 263, which was referred to in the course of hearing before us. In the
case before the Karnataka High Court, the issue was similar inasmuch as
therein, the Assessing Officer had invoked the provisions of section 80-I(9)
r.w.s. 10A(6) of the Act while re-determining the claim of exemption in terms
of the then prevailing section 10A(4) of the Act, and the assessment years
were 1995-96 to 1998-99. The provisions of section 10A(6) r.w.s. 80 -I(9) of
the Act, which were before the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court are quite similar
to the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act before us.
The Hon'ble Karnataka High Court, upheld the stand that the requirements of
the provisions of section 80-I(9) of the Act are two-fold, namely that there
should be a close connection between the assessee and the other person, which
may be a reason for the assessee to earn higher profits but, more importantly
there should be material to indicate that assessee had indulged in an
arrangement with the other person so as to produce to the assessee more
profits than ordinarily what profits the assessee might have expected to arise
from such business. As per the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court, it was for the
Assessing Officer to indicate any material or evidence to disclose any such
arrangement between the assessee and the other person. The aforesaid judgement
of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court justifies the assertion of the assessee
before us that the onus for justifying the invoking of section 80-IA(10)
r.w.s. 10A(7) of the Act is on the Revenue based on cogent material. At this
point, we may also make a reference to the judgement of the Hon'ble Bombay
High Court in the case of CIT vs. M/s Schmetz India Pvt. Ltd. vide Income Tax
Appeal No.4508 of 2010 dated 04.09.2012, which is also to the similar effect.
In the case before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court assessee was a wholly owned
subsidiary of a German Company. It had two divisions - one at Kandla in the
Kandla Free Trade Zone, engaged in the manufacture and export of industrial
sewing machine needless; and other at Mumbai, engaged in trading in industrial
sewing machine needless. The manufacturing division at Kandla exported its
entire production of industrial machine needless to its holding company in
Germany. For the assessment year 2004-05 assessee declared an income of
Rs.20.54 crores from its manufacturing division at Kandla and claimed 100%
deduction u/s 10A of the Act. During the course of the assessment proceedings,
Assessing Officer was of the view that abnormal profits had been declared in
respect of the Kandla division, only in view of the income therefrom being
exempt u/s 10A of the Act, and that the trading division at Mumbai showed a
loss of Rs.70.29 lacs. The Assessing Officer invoked the provisions of section
10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act to hold that profits of Kandla Division
were abnormal profits. The Tribunal disagreed with the Assessing Officer. The
Tribunal, inte r-alia, held that the Assessing Officer has not been able to
prove that any arrangement had been arrived between the parties which resulted
in extraordinary profits to the respondent- assessee's manufacturing division
at Kandla. Consequently, the working o f the profits by the Assessing Officer
was not approved. The aforesaid action of the Tribunal was upheld by the
Hon'ble Bombay High Court. On this aspect, the Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal
in the case of Digital Equipment India Ltd. vs. DCIT, 103 TTJ 3 29 (Bang.) has
also held that the conditions of the  16 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014
Spicer India Ltd.
section have to be objectively satisfied by the Assessing Officer, based on
cogent reasoning and evidence.
12\. At the time of hearing, the Ld. Representative for the assessee
vehemently argued that the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of
the Act are inapplicable in the present case because there is no material lead
by the Revenue to say that there was any arrangement between the assessee and
the associated enterprises which produced to the assessee more than the
'ordinary profits' within the meaning of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of
the Act. According to the Ld. Representative, the transactions of the assessee
by way of rendering software engineering services to its associated
enterprises abroad are not arranged so to yield any extraordinary profits to
the assessee. The Ld. Representative pointed out that assessee was charging
the same rate for services rendered to associated enterprises as well as to
the non-related parties. The details of rates charged by the assessee to the
third parties vis- à-vis the related parties have also been placed in the
Paper Book along with sample copies of invoices raised on the and non-related
parties. It was also pointed out with reference to the submissions made to the
Assessing Officer, which have been reproduced in para 2.6 of the assessment
order, that the assessee has continued to charge similar rates even after the
tax holiday period of STPI Unit had ended.
13\. At the time of hearing, it was explained that the tax holiday u/s 10A of
the Act was available for Unit No.I at Pune upto assessment year 2007-08; that
for Unit No.II at Pune upto assessment year 2011-12; and, that for Chennai
Unit upto assessment year 2009-10. A statement showing operating margins to
total cost earned by the assessee from the STPI Units relatable to the
software engineering services segment was furnished to show that even after
the expiry of the tax holiday period the profits of the Units is higher than
the other Units of the assessee.
14\. In this context, a reference has also been made to the commercial reasons
explained before the Assessing Officer for the high profits earned by the
assessee's STPI Unit. From the submissions furnished to the Assessing Officer,
which have been reproduced in para 2.6 of the assessment order, it is revealed
that reasons were advanced to justify the higher margins of the STPI Units.
Firstly, it was contended that there was substantial cost savings in terms of
costs on sales, marketing, sale promotion and advertisement because majority
of the business in the engineering services segment was with affiliates only.
Secondly, it was pointed out that assessee is in the business of IT enabled
services rendering engineering consultancy services in execution of industrial
automation and building automation and control projects and it does not incur
much product development costs or investments which are usually incurred by
other software companies. Thirdly, it was pointed out that the salary levels
in the case of the assessee are much lower than other software companies
because assessee was hiring electronics and process engineering
Graduates/Diploma holders and not software professionals. It is also pointed
out that assessee has a lower rate of idle staff as it works mostly on in-
house Honeywell Technology and therefore the productivity of the employees is
much higher than other software companies. Further, it was also pointed out
that assessee was reimbursed all the costs, like foreign travel and living
expenses incurred abroad by its employees in the course of rendering
engineering/software services. Assessee was also reimbursed incidental
expenses incurred by it viz. visa costs, work permit costs, etc. and therefore
the cost of sales was on lower side, as a result of which the percentage of
Operating profit to total cost shows a higher percentage, although the impact
on profit remains unaltered. All these points, which were raised before the
Assessing Officer, have been reiterated before us to show that the higher
profits are not attributable to any arrangement with associated enterprises
but due to business reasons.
17
ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
15\. Apart therefrom, it has also been pointed out that assessee is a public
limited company listed on the stock-exchange wherein the overseas Honeywell
entities owned 81.24% of shareholding and the public shareholding is to the
extent of 18.76%. It was pointed out that initially TATA group was also owning
shares in the assessee company to the extent of 40% and Honeywell entities
held 41% and the balance 19% was held by the public. This pattern had changed
from November, 2004 onwards when the TATA group gave up its shareholding in
the assessee company. On the basis of the aforesaid shareholding pattern, a
plea setup by the assessee is that if there was any manipulation of profits by
assessee charging higher rates to its overseas Honeywell group entities
resulting in shifting of profits from overseas entities to the assessee-
company, it would not be a prudent exercise by the Honeywell group because it
does benefit the Honeywell group as a whole. Since there is a significant
public shareholding in the assessee company, it would mean that the any
extraordinary benefit passed on by overseas Honeywell group entities to
assessee would result in a loss for Honeywell group on an overall basis to the
extent of public shareholding in the assessee company. It was, therefore,
contended that in such a scenario, it could not be said that there was any
arrangement between the assessee and the overseas Honeywell entities to
produce higher profits to the assessee. In support of such proposition,
reliance has been placed on the decisions of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal
in the case of ITO vs. Zydus Nycomed Healthcare (ITA Nos.4013/Mum/208,
4206/Mum/2009 and 4343/Mum/2009 dated 31.10.2013).
16\. Apart from the aforesaid, it has been vehemently argued that ordinary
profits for the purposes of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80-IA(10) of the Act cannot
be computed relying upon the Transfer Pricing documents prepared by the
assessee. The Ld. Representative pointed out that having regard to the
intention of the Transfer Pricing Provisions, the margins determined under the
TNM Method are to be taken as indicative of the least profits that must be
retained in India and it cannot be used to benchmark the 'ordinary profits' as
referred to in section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act. The sum and
substance of the plea setup by the assessee is that the legislative intent
behind the Transfer Pricing Provisions is different from the intent behind
section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act.
17\. The Ld. CIT-DR has made detailed submissions in support of the invoking
of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act in the present case. The Ld.
CIT-DR submitted that section 80-IA(10) of the Act placed much lighter burden
of proof on the Assessing Officer because of the presence of the expression
"it appears" in section 80-IA(10) of the Act. According to the Ld. CIT-DR,
section 80-IA(10) can be invoked by the Assessing Officer when 'it appears' to
him, and it is not subject to the Assessing Officer's belief or satisfaction
as is the case with invoking of section 147/148, etc.. The following portion
of section 80-IA(10) of the Act was emphasized "...........the Assessing
Officer shall, in computing the profits and gains of such eligible business
for the purposes of the deduction under this section, take the amount of
profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived........." to say that
it does not require the Assessing Officer to precisely determine the eligible
profits, but only a prima-facie satisfaction about presence of more than the
ordinary profits would suffice. It is sought to be emphasized that because of
the presence of the words ".......as may be reasonably deemed to have been
derived......." in section 80-IA(10) of the Act, a much lighter burden of
proof is put on the Assessing Officer for computing tax avoidance. As per the
Ld. CIT-DR, similar to the Transfer Pricing Provisions, the said Provision
does not require a precise accuracy on the part of the Assessing Officer. At
this point, the Ld. CIT-DR relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Kerala High
Court in the case of Abdul Vahab P. vs. ACIT, (2012) 249 CTR 102 (Kerala)
wherein the word "appears" has been understood to imply a 'prima-facie'
satisfaction of the Assessing Officer. Therefore, it is sought to be made out
18 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
that a prima-facie satisfaction of the Assessing Officer is enough to apply
the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act.
18\. It is further submitted that the word "arrangement" used in section 80-
IA(10) of the Act is to be understood as any agreement with the associated
enterprise and in support of the same reliance has been placed on the decision
of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Bank of India Ltd. vs.
Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico, (1972) 42 CompCas 211 (BomXDPB-p-42),
wherein it has been held as under :-
> "The word "arrange" has, as one of its meaning, in the Shorter Oxford
> Dictionary, edition, "to come to an agreement or understanding", and the
> word "arrangement" has, as its primary meaning, "the action of arranging".
> As a matter of plain language it would, therefore, follow that the term
> "arrangement" means any agreement or understanding between the parties
> concerned."
19\. As per the Ld. CIT-DR, since there is an agreement between the assessee
and the associated enterprises for Provision of IT enabled
engineering/software services, it is to be understood as an "arrangement"
within the meaning of section 80-IA(10) of the Act. According to him, the
requirements of section 80-IA(10) of the Act are satisfied if there exists an
arrangement which leads to production of more than ordinary profits.
Therefore, according to him, in the present case, the Assessing Officer is
justified to invoke section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act inasmuch as
the profit margin of the assessee's STPI Units is 80.06% as against 17.06% of
the comparable selected by the assessee itself in its Transfer Pricing Study.
As per the Ld. CIT-DR, when the arrangement has led to resulting into more
than ordinary profits, necessary condition for invoking section 80-IA(10) of
the Act is satisfied.
20\. Apart from the aforesaid submissions, the Ld. CIT-DR has made other pleas
also to justify the restriction of deduction u/s 10A of the Act. In this
context, he has pointed out that even the Safe Harbor Rules issued by the CBDT
with respect to the Transfer Pricing assessment provide for 20% operating
profit as an acceptable profit in IT enabled services segment and therefore
that was a good benchmark as to what constitutes 'ordinary profits' in the
assessee's impugned line of business. The Ld. CIT-DR also made a submission
that even if the computation of excess profits done by the Assessing Officer
based on the margin of the comparable is not found to be a good methodology,
yet the failure of computation process by the Assessing Officer would not
vitiate the invoking section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act in the
present case. The excess profits according to him can be computed by an
appropriate method by remanding the matter back to the file of the Assessing
Officer. In any case, it has been contended section 80-IA(10) of the Act
requires computing of 'more than ordinary profits' in the eligible business.
Comparable companies are in the same line of the business and having similar
functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed as the assessee,
therefore, comparable companies are carrying on eligible business, and thus
the profits margin of comparable reflect ordinary profits.
21\. With regard to the assessee's plea that even after the expiry of section
10A benefits, assessee was declaring healthy profits, the Ld. CIT-DR pointed
out that what matters in future years is the actual amount of the taxes paid
and not merely the profits generated in the Unit. It was also contended that
the fact that assessee has rendered services to the non-related parties at the
same rates is also not relevant for the purposes of application of section
10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act. It was also submitted by him that fact of
the assessee being reimbursed the travelling costs, etc. cannot be responsible
for assessee's high profit which are not of an ordinary level. The Ld. CIT-DR
pointed out that if certain part of the expenditure is being incurred by the
other parties then the cost of such expenditure would certainly be reduced
from the  19 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
price charged by the assessee for the services rendered. In any case, it is
pointed out that reimbursement of expenses is a profit neutral transaction and
does not impact the profitability of the assessee.
22\. Before we proceed further, it would be appropriate to examine the scope
and intent of the provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act.
In this context, a reference has been made to the CBDT Circular No.308 dated
29.06.2008 wherein the reasons for introduction of sub-section (7) to section
10A of the Act has been explained. In-particular, reference has been made to
the following contents of the Circular :-
> "The provisions of sub-section (8) and sub-section (9) of section 80-I will
> also apply in relation to the industrial undertaking referred to in the new
> section 10A as they apply in relation to an industrial undertaking referred
> to under section 80-I. Under the applied sub-section (8) of section 80-I, it
> is provided that where an Assessee has several units, some in the free trade
> zone and some outside, the profits of the unit in the free trade zone will
> be computed after taking the cost of the goods transferred to or from the
> unit on the basis of the market value of such goods. The applied sub-section
> (9) of section 80-I empowers the Income-tax Officer to determine the
> reasonable profits that could be attributed to the qualifying undertaking in
> the free trade zone in cases where, owing to the close connection between
> the Assessee and any other persons or for any other reason, the course of
> the business is so arranged that the industrial undertaking set up in the
> free trade zone derives more than ordinary profits which may be expected to
> arise in that business. This provision has been made with a view to avoiding
> abuse of the new tax concessions by manipulation of profits between
> associate concerns or different units of the same concern."
> [underlined for emphasis by us]
> 23\. Quite clearly, the provisions of section 10A(7) of the Act intend to
> plug abuse of tax concession by manipulation of profits between associated
> concerns or between different units of the same concern. The objective of
> the aforesaid Provision is that the tax concessions are not abused by
> manipulation of profits. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid
> explanation in the CBDT Circular (supra) signifies the legislative intent
> and it is also manifested in the language of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80
> -IA(10) of the Act. We say so for the reason that the phraseology of section
> 80-IA(10) of the Act itself suggests that the profits and gains of an
> eligible business cannot be tinkered with by the Assessing Officer merely
> because they are more than the ordinary profits or that they are quite high.
> The existence of substantial or more than ordinary profits by itself does
> not sufficiently empower the Assessing Officer to disregard them and
> determine the profits which he may consider to be reasonably deemed to have

> legislative objective of plugging abuse of the tax concessions granted u/s
> 10A of the Act by manipulation of profits between associated parties. In
> other words, the import of the expression "so arranged" has to be read in
> conjunction with the legislative intent that there should not be any abuse
> of tax concession by manipulation of profits. Therefore, section 10A(7)
> r.w.s. 80 -
IA(10) of the Act can be invoked only where it is shown that the course of
business is so arranged which reflects an abuse of tax concession whereby the
business transacted between two entities is so arranged, which produces to the
assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in
such eligible business. The emphasis is to eschew those 'more than the
ordinary profits' which are as a result of a business between two closely
connected concerns having been arranged with the intent of abuse of the tax
20 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
concession. Ostensibly, in the present case, the Revenue would have to justify
that the course of business between assessee and the associated enterprises
has been 'so arranged' which produces to the assessee more than the ordinary
profits which might be expected to arise in such eligible business with the
intention of abusing the tax concession granted in section 10A of the Act. The
mere existence of (i) a close connection between the assessee and the other
person; and, (ii) more than ordinary profits is not sufficient to justify
invoking of section 80-IA(10) of the Act in the absence of there being any
material to say that the course of business between them is "so arranged" to
abuse the tax concessions granted u/s 10A of the Act by manipulating profits
between associated persons. Ostensibly, the same is required to be
demonstrated on the basis of a cogent material and evidence. In other words,
the presence of the expression "so arranged" has to be understood in the
context of the abuse of tax concession which is sought to be plugged by the
provisions of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act.
24\. On this aspect, the Ld. CIT-DR had vehemently argued, based on the
judgement of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Bank of India Ltd.
(supra) that the meaning of the word "arranged' in section 80-IA(10) of the
Act has to be understood to mean an agreement or an understanding between the
parties concerned. The relevant portion of the decision of the Hon'ble Bombay
High Court has been reproduced in the earlier part of this order, according to
which, it is said that the term arrangement in plain language means any
agreement or understanding between the parties concerned. On this basis, the
Ld. CIT-DR submitted that undeniably there is an agreement between the
assessee and the associated enterprises whereby the services have been
provided by the assessee to them and therefore the same is to be understood as
an "arrangement" within the meaning of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80-IA(10) of the
Act. Along with the aforesaid, it has also been emphasized, on the basis of
the language of section 80-IA(10) of the Act that, the Assessing Officer is
not required to be prove that there is an arrangement for producing more than
ordinary profits. Whereas, as per the Ld. CIT-DR, section provides that
arrangement leading to production of more than ordinary profit will satisfy
the necessary condition of section 80-IA(10) of the Act. Thus, according to
the Ld. CIT-DR, in the instant case there is an arrangement and it has lead to
production of more than the ordinary profits. According to the Ld. CIT-DR, the
meaning of the words "so arranged" in section 80-IA(10) of the Act only seeks
to ensure that there was an agreement between the assessee and associated
enterprise.
25\. We have carefully examined the aforesaid contentions of the Ld. CIT- DR.
In our considered opinion, the import of the expression "arranged" in section
80-IA(10) of the Act is not to be understood in its plain language but the
same has to be understood in the context in which it is placed in the section.
Notably, section 80-IA(10) of the Act restricts the plain meaning of the term
"arranged" because it is placed between the words "........the course of
business between them is so arranged that the business transacted between them
produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be
expected to arise in such eligible business........." . Therefore, it would
necessarily mean that the 'arrangement' referred to is an arrangement of the
course of business which produces to the assessee more than the ordinary
profits with the intent of abusing the tax concession. Thus, the word
"arranged" in the section does not envisage a simple arrangement, but a
arrangement of "the course of business transacted" which produces to the
assessee more than ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in such a
business with the intent of abusing the tax concessions. Therefore, the
meaning of the words "so arranged" have to be understood in the context in
which they are placed in section 80-IA(10) of the Act. A mere agreement
between the assessee and the associated enterprises for transacting business
is not enough to invoke section 80-IA(10) of the Act.
21
ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
26\. In-fact, even the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Bank of India
Ltd. (supra) has also appreciated the contextual meaning of the expression
"arrangement". The issue before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court was with regard
to the scheme of re-construction or arrangement contained in section 391(1) of
the Companies Act, 1956. In the context of section 391(1) of the Companies
Act, 1956, the Hon'ble High Court was dealing with the meaning of the word
"arrangement". After having explained the meaning of the term arrangement in
plain language, which we have referred earlier, the Hon'ble High Court went on
to say as under in the context of the word "arrangement" qua section 391(1) of
the Companies Act, 1956 :-
> "Section 391(1), however, in any opinion somewhat restricts this otherwise
> unlimited import of the term "arrangement" in so far as the said section
> applies only to an agreement or understanding between the company and its
> creditors or any class of them, or between the company and its members or
> any class of them, or between the company and its members or any class of
> them, which would necessarily mean that it must be an agreement or
> understanding which affects their rights"
> [underlined for emphasis by us]
> 27\. The aforesaid clearly points out that the Hon'ble High Court imparted
> meaning to the word "arrangement" in the context of section 391(1) of the
> Companies Act, 1956 to mean that it must be an agreement or understanding
> which affects the rights between the company and its creditors or any class
> of them and between the company and its members or any class of them. By the
> same analogy in the present context, we have to understand the meaning of
> the expression "as arranged" in section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act
> to mean a situation whereby the course of business has been so arranged that
> the business transacted produces to the assessee more that the ordinary
> profits with an intent to abuse the tax concessions granted in section 10A
> of the Act. Moreover, if one is to understand the import of the expression
> "so arranged" in section 80-IA(10) of the Act as canvassed by the Ld. CIT-
> DR, it would mean that for the purposes of fulfillment of the conditions
> prescribed in section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act, existence of mere
> close connection and more than the ordinary profits would suffice. In other
> words, as per the Revenue, the existence of close connection and high
> profits would lead to a presumption that there is an "arrangement" within
> the meaning of section 80-
IA(10) of the Act. The aforesaid plea, in our view, not only belies the
language of section 80-IA(10) but also the legislative intent which seeks to
curtail the abuse of tax concession by manipulation of profits between
associated concerns. Therefore, an arrangement which is referred to in section
10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act has to be one which is prefaced by an
intention to abuse the tax concessions, as per the intendment of the
legislature. Therefore, existence of a mere agreement to do business is not
enough to fulfill the requirement of section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the
Act in the context of the words "the course of business between them is so
arranged".
28\. At this stage, we may also address the argument of the Ld. CIT-DR that
the burden cast on the Assessing Officer in section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 - IA(10)
of the Act is much lighter and even a prima-facie satisfaction of an existence
of tax avoidance is sufficient. In this context, we may refer to the decision
of the Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Digital Equipment India
Ltd. (supra), wherein similar argument from the side of the Revenue has been
addressed. The Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal was dealing with invoking of
section 10A(6) r.w.s. 80 -I(9) of the Act for assessment year 1995-96, which
are pari-materia to section 10A(7) r.w.s. 80 -IA(10) of the Act invoked by the
Revenue before us. The following discussion is relevant :-
> "The requirements under the section are :
22
> ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
> (a) There must be a close connection between the appellant and other person.
> (b) The course of business between them should be so arranged that it
> produces to the appellant more than the ordinary profits from such business.
> To satisfy the above test the AO has to adduce evidence and reasons cogently
> and the same is open to verification by the appellate authorities. The
> primary rule of evidence is that "what is apparent is real" unless proved
> otherwise by the person alleging it otherwise. The manner of satisfaction
> outlined in the section should be based on evidence and not on surmise or
> suspicion. The question is not whether the onus is light or heavy but
> whether the AO has discussed objectively the conditions mentioned in the
> section to disturb the results declared by the appellant. In this case, the
> AO has failed to adduce any evidence or reason to satisfy the invoking of s.
> 80-1(9). First of all, a mere substantial profit does not give rise to any

> presume the existence of close connection or possibility of an arrangement
> for earning more than ordinary profits. In this case the profits earned is
> comparable with the profits earned by other companies in the same industry.
> Hence there is no case for further verification. The AO has compared the

> by the AO. When the profits earned are reasonable and not excessive, there
> is no reason to sustain the addition Further there is no evidence of

> 29\. Quite clearly, as per the Tribunal the question is not whether the onus
> is light or heavy but whether the Assessing Officer has discussed
> objectively the conditions mentioned in the section to disturb the results
> declared by the appellant."
15\. The Tribunal in assessee's case also referred to the arrangement between
the parties for earning more than ordinary profits wherein onus was upon the
Department to prove that an arrangement existed. The findings of Tribunal in
Honeywell Automation India Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra) vide paras 30 to 34 were
referred, which we have reproduced in paras above.
16\. The Tribunal in assessee's case applying the principle laid down in
Honeywell Automation India Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra) held as under:-
23
> ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
"20. Now, coming to the facts of the present case, the issue arising is in
relation to grant of deduction under section 10B of the Act by invoking the
provisions of section 10B(8) r.w.s. 80IA(8) and 80IA(10) of the Act. At the
first instance, it may be noted that the provisions of section 10B are pari-
materia to the provisions of section 10A of the Act. The assessee had shown
profits from export of propeller shaft components and light axle components
earned by EOUs at 38% and 34% as against the average profit mark-up range of
8.4% to 10.77% in case of propeller shaft components and 4.2% to 7.5% in case
of axle components of external overseas comparables, which was accepted by the
TPO in his report under section 92CA(4) of the Act. In the above said
circumstances, where the profit margins declared by the assessee have been
accepted to be at arm's length by the TPO, no curtailment of deduction under
section 10B can be made by invoking the provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s.
80IA(8) and 80IA(10) of the Act, relying on the ratio laid down by the
Tribunal in M/s Honeywell Automation India Limited vs. DCIT (supra). The onus
was upon the Department to prove that an arrangement existed between the
assessee and its AEs to earn more than ordinary profits and in the absence of
the said onus having been discharged by the Department and following the same
parity of reasoning as laid down by the Tribunal in M/s Honeywell Automation
India Limited vs. DCIT (supra) and also following the similar proposition laid
down by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in M/s A.T. Kearney India Pv t. Ltd.
(supra), we find no merit in the order of the Commissioner passed under
section 263 of the Act in this regard. Another aspect of the issue is where
the assessee had consistently earned higher profit margins right from start of
its business even before EOUs were set up and where similar trend has shown in
the hands of the assessee which, in turn, had been accepted by the TPO, while
determining the arm's length price of the international transactions between
the assessee and its AEs, then there is no merit in invoking of jurisdiction
by the Commissioner under section 263 of the Act. Further, it is to be noted
that there was justification for earning higher profit margins due to
substantial cost savings i.e. locational advantage, lower infrastructure cost,
savings in tooling cost, no cost of investment and know-how/IPR being a
restricted scope supplier of components. Where the assessee is getting the
designs and the know-how from its AEs and was supplying the components, in
turn, to its AEs i.e. where the assessee was a limited scope manufacturer,
then we find no merit in the observations of the Commissioner in this regard
that the assessee had earned more than ordinary profits, which in any case
have been justifiably explained. Another aspect of the issue raised by the
Commissioner was with reference to the royalty of 2.85% not payable on export
of components supplied to the AE and warranty not borne by the assessee. As
per the Commissioner, the same reflected the intention of the assessee to show
higher profits from the 10B units. The Ld. Authorized Representative for the
assessee pointed out that the Assessing Officer while giving effect to the
order of the Commissioner passed under section 263 of the Act has given a
finding that the profit margin earned in case of propeller shaft components
was lower than the average profit margin of comparable and has reduced the
deduction under section 10B only in respect of profits from export of axle
components, which in turn establishes that there was no arrangement as
alleged. In the fact of the present case, where the assessee was restricted
scope and limited risk manufacturer of components exported to its AE, where
the licensed know-how and designs owned by the AE were made available to the
assessee only for it use itself reflects that in such circumstances question
of royalty payment to AE does not arise and in the absence of any agreement
between the parties for payment of royalty, we find no merit in the
observation of the Commissioner in this regard. Further, where the assessee
was only exporting components of propeller shaft and axles and the finished
products were assembled by the AE, there is no scope for providing warranty on
export of such components. The finding of the Commissioner in this regard that
the assessee had shown higher profits to claim deduction under 10B units is
thus misplaced. In view thereof, we find no merit in the order of the
Commissioner passed under section 263 of the Act and reversing the same we
hold that the assessee is entitled to claim of deduction under section 10B of
the Act in entirety. The grounds of appeal raised by the assessee are
allowed."
24
> ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India Ltd.
17\. Further, in assessment year 2007-08, the claim of the assessee of 10B
deduction was further curtailed by the CIT(A) by applying the provisions of
section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act. Both the assessee and the Revenue
were in appeal before the Tribunal against the finding of CIT(A) in assessment
year 2007-08.
The Tribunal in ITA No. 1113/PN/2012 and in ITA No.1280 /PN/2012 relating to
assessment year 2007-08, vide consolidated order along with appeal in
assessment year 2006-07, vide order dated 08.07.2015 applied the same
principle and held that there is no merit in curtailment of 10B deduction by
applying the provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act.
18\. The issue arising before us is identical to the issue before the Tribunal
in assessee's own case in earlier years. It may be pointed out here that in
assessment year 2006-07, the assessee had declared margins from export of
propelled shaft components and light axle components earned by EOU unit at 38%
and 34% as against the average profit mark-up range of 8.4% to 10.77% in the
case of propelled shaft components and 4.2% to 7.5% in the case of axle
components of external overseas comparables, which was accepted by the TPO in
his report under section 92CA(4) of the Act. However, 10B deduction was
curtailed by invoking provisions of section 10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act.
In the facts of the present case before us, the margins shown by the assessee
as noted by the Assessing Officer were 28.13% in the export of axle components
by EOU unit as against the margins of 10.6% shown by the external overseas
comparables, which was also accepted by the TPO in the present case. In the
totality of the above said facts and circumstances and in view of the issue
being identical to the issue before the Tribunal in the earlier years and
following the same parity of reasoning, we hold that there is no merit in
curtailing the deduction claimed under section 10B of the Act by invoking
provisions of section  25 ITA No.1375/PN/2014 CO No.86/PN/2014 Spicer India
Ltd.
10B(7) r.w.s. 80IA(10) of the Act in respect of export of axle components. The
profit margin declared by the assessee in respect of export of propelled shaft
components was accepted by the Assessing Officer and the deduction claimed
under section 10B of the Act was allowed. Another point which needs mention
here is that the Assessing Officer while restricting the deduction under
section 10B of the Act vide para 14 at page 17 of the assessment order had
relied on the issue arising in the case of Honeywell Automation (I) Ltd. for
assessment year 2006-07, wherein the DRP had accepted the view of Assessing
Officer therein and upheld the disallowance of deduction for assessment year
2006-07. The Tribunal while deciding the appeal in the case of Honeywell
Automation (I) Ltd. has reversed the orders of authorities below and in view
of the Tribunal applying the same parity of reasoning while deciding the issue
in the case of assessee before us in earlier years i.e. 2006-07 and 2007-08,
we find no merit in the grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue. Further, we
also find merit in the Cross Objections raised by the assessee in this regard
and applying the earlier year ratio, we direct the Assessing Officer to allow
deduction claimed under section 10B of the Act to the assessee against the
profits of EOU unit of axle components at Chakan, Pune. The grounds of appeal
raised by the Revenue are thus, dismissed and the cross objections filed by
the assessee are allowed.
19\. In the result, appeal of the Revenue is dismissed and the Cross
Objections filed by the assessee are allowed.
