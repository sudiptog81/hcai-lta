                                             versus
    UNION OF INDIA & ORS                                       ..... Respondents
    Advocates who appeared in this case:
    For the Petitioner:             Mr Praveen Anand, Mr Archana Shankar, Ms
                                    Geetanjali Visvanathan, Ms Neeti Nelson, Ms
                                    Asavani Jain and Mr Priyanks Dubey,
                                    Advocates.
    81.     Prima        facie,      the       aforesaid   table   indicates   that        those
characteristics, in respect of which the two varieties were found to have
qualified the DUS test, are more or less identical when compared inter W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 48 of 49 se. However, this Court is not inclined to
examine the said controversy any further as the same has not been considered
in any of the impugned orders. However, it is obvious that if the question
whether the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 are different and distinct from each
other is required to be determined, a meaningful examination of their
essential characteristics would be relevant.
82\. In view of the above, the impugned orders dated 09.09.2014 and 27.08.2018
are set aside. The impugned letter dated 24.06.2013, to the extent that it
confirms that Kaveri's KMH-50 is eligible for registration under the Act, is
set aside. Pioneer's application for conducting the special test in the nature
of DNA profiling of the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 is restored to the file of
the Registrar for considering it afresh, if necessary.
83\. The petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. All pending

     CORAM
    HON'BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU
                                    JUDGMENT
VIBHU BAKHRU, J
1\. The petitioner (hereafter 'Pioneer') is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., company incorporated in United States of
America. Pioneer claims that it is involved in the business of research,
development, breeding, production and marketing of plant varieties since the
year 1926. Respondent no.2 (Kaveri Seeds Limited
\- hereafter 'Kaveri') is also involved in the business of research,
development, breeding of seeds and plant varieties.
2\. The controversy involved in the present petitions relates to the
acceptance of Kaveri's application for registration of a variety of maize,
referred to as KMH50 under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers'
Rights Act, 2001 (hereafter 'the Act'). Pioneer claims that KMH50 is
identical/similar to its variety of maize referred to as 30V92. Pioneer has
also filed an application for registration of 30V92 under the Act. Pioneer had
filed an opposition to Kaveri's application for registration of KMH50 under
the Act.
3\. Pioneer has also filed an application with Protection of Plant Varieties
and Farmers' Rights Authority (hereafter 'the Authority') under Section 24(5)
of the Act, inter alia, claiming that KMH50 was identical to 30V92 and the two
varieties are one and the same and further W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page
2 of 49 alleging that Kaveri had misappropriated the germplasm of 30V92 under
the denomination KMH50. Pioneer had also filed an application for conducting
special test (DNA Test) for determining the genetic profile of KMH50 and 30V92
in support of its claim that Kaveri was abusing the provisions of the Act.
4\. Pioneer's application for conducting special test was rejected by the
Registrar, Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority
(hereafter 'Registrar') by an order dated 27.08.2013 on the sole ground that
the two varieties of maize (KMH50 and 30V92) were found to conform to the
criteria of distinctiveness, uniformity and stability pursuant to the tests
conducted in this regard (hereafter 'DUS'). According to the Registrar, a
special test as sought for by Pioneer was permissible only if DUS test had
failed; that is, the test failed to establish that the plant varieties conform
to the DUS criteria. Since, the Authority was of the view that the DUS test
was successful, it rejected the Pioneer's application for conducting special
test.
5\. The said order dated 27th August, 2013 is impugned by Pioneer in W.P.(C)
6470/2013. Pioneer also impugns a letter dated 24th June, 2013 sent by the
Registrar to the Government of India stating that both the varieties -
Pioneer's 30V92 and Kaveri's KMH50 - are distinct and are eligible for
registration under the Act.
6\. Pioneer also impugns an order dated 9th September, 2014, whereby its
opposition to Kaveri's application (application no. E2ZM40916 - KMH50) for
registration of KMH50 was closed and W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 3 of
49 Kaveri's variety KMH50 was directed to be registered subject to satisfying
other conditions. The said order is impugned in W.P.(C) 6028/2014. The orders
dated 9th September, 2014 and 27th August, 2013 are hereby referred to as the
'impugned orders' and the letter dated 24th June, 2013 is referred to as the
impugned letter.
Factual Background
7\. On 22nd August, 2007, Pioneer filed an application or registration of
variety of maize bearing denomination 30V92 as an extant variety. On 28th
January, 2009, Kaveri filed an application (application no. E2ZM40916 - KMH50)
for registration of a variety of maize bearing the denomination KMH50.
Kaveri's application was advertised by the Authority on 3rd May, 2010.
Pioneer's application was also advertised with the corrigendum on 1st April,
2011.
7.1 Pioneer claims that it was informed about the similarity between its
variety and KMH50 by the Manager of PHI Seeds Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Pioneer Overseas Corporation and the Senior Research Associate
of Pioneer Overseas Corporation who had visited the DUS Test Centre at
Rajendernagar, Andhra Pradesh on 7th October, 2010 in connection with another
variety bearing denomination 30B11. It is claimed that during the said visit,
the said employees had observed maize plants being grown at DUS Test Centre,
which were similar to Pioneer's variety 30V92. This led Pioneer to make
further enquiries which revealed that KMH50 had been advertised in the
official journal on 3rd May, 2010. Pioneer alleged that the pictures provided
in the W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 4 of 49 journal were inadequate and
insufficient for any meaningful comparison.
7.2 Thereafter, on 18th October, 2010, Pioneer had sought full passport data
with regard to Kaveri's application for registration of KMH50.
7.3 On 2nd December, 2010, Pioneer sought extension of time to file opposition
to grant of registration of KMH50 in favour of Kaveri. This application was
allowed by the Registrar of Variety by an order dated 15th July, 2011 and the
time for filing the notice of opposition was extended from 21st September,
2010 to 31st December, 2010. In the meanwhile, the Pioneer had filed its
notice of opposition on 3rd December, 2010, which was forwarded by the
Authority to Kaveri under the cover of its letter dated 22nd July, 2011.
7.4 Kaveri received the said notice of opposition on 29th July, 2011. Being
aggrieved by the order dated 15 th July, 2011 granting extension of time for
filing the opposition, Kaveri filed a writ petition (being W.P.(C) 6819/2011)
before this Court impugning the order dated 15 th July, 2011. On 19th
September, 2011, this Court passed an ad interim order in the aforesaid writ
petition staying further proceedings before the Authority till the next date
of hearing. However, this Court also directed that Kaveri would not claim
registration of plant variety in its favour and shall not take advantage of
its application for registration, as the proceedings in this regard had been
stayed. Thus, by virtue of the said order, Kaveri was precluded from claiming
that its application had W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 5 of 49 been
accepted and KMH50 was deemed to be registered in its favour by efflux of
time.
7.5 On 8th April 2011, Pioneer filed an application under Section 24(5) of the
Act, inter alia, praying that appropriate directions be issued to protect the
interest of Pioneer and Kaveri's application for registration of KMH50 be
rejected. In its application, Pioneer claimed that in the meantime it sent the
seeds of KMH50 to Pioneer generic profile lab. The test carried out had
revealed that germplasm of KMH50 was similar to the germplasm of 30V92 to the
extent of 99.45% to 99.80%. Pioneer claimed that the said percentage was
within the margin of error and indicated that the two varieties, namely, KMH50
and 30V92 were the same. Pioneer also alleged in its application that Kaveri
had abused the provision of the Act by making false declaration in its
application form and had deliberately provided incorrect information. It has
been alleged that Kaveri had misappropriated the germplasm of 30V92 and had
deceived the public by showing different values for group characteristic.
7.6 On 8th January, 2013, DUS test report of Pioneer's variety 30V92 was
forwarded to Kaveri. The report indicated that 30V92 conform for the DUS
criteria.
7.7 Thereafter, on 6th May, 2013, the petitioner filed an application seeking
DNA test of its variety 30V92 considering KMH50 as a reference variety. On 8th
April, 2011, Pioneer filed a petition under Section 24(5) of the Act (numbered
as A.1/2011), inter alia, claiming W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 6 of 49
that germplasm of KMH50 was identical to 30V92 and the two varieties are one
and the same.
7.8 The petitioner's application for conducting special test was rejected by
the impugned order dated 27th August, 2013 on the ground that the DUS test
reports had indicated that both the varieties conformed to the DUS criteria.
7.9 The impugned order dated 27th August, 2013 is the subject matter of
challenge in W.P.(C) 6470/2013.
7.10 On 29th May, 2014, Kaveri unconditionally withdrew its writ petition -
W.P.(C) 6819/2011 captioned as 'Kaveri Seed Company Ltd. v. Registrar of Plant
Varieties & Anr.' 7.11 On 30th May, 2014, Kaveri sent a letter to the
Registrar requesting it to proceed with the registration of KMH50.
7.12 Thereafter, on 14th July, 2014, the Registrar issued a notice for hearing
of opposition, which was heard on 8th August, 2014. By the impugned order
dated 9th September, 2014, the Registrar rejected the Pioneer's opposition as
infructuous.
Submissions
8\. Mr Sudhir Chandra, learned senior counsel appearing for Pioneer assailed
the impugned order dated 09.09.2014, essentially, on three fronts. First, he
submitted that Kaveri's application for registration of KMH-50 stood abandoned
by virtue of Section 21(4) of the Act and, therefore, the Registrar had no
jurisdiction to consider the same. He W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 7 of
49 submitted that in terms of Section 21(4) of the Act, Kaveri could file a
counter-statement within a period of two months of the receipt of notice of
opposition but, despite full opportunity, Kaveri had not filed any counter-
statement. He further pointed out that on 08.08.2018, a statement was made on
behalf of Kaveri that it did not want to file any counter statement or
evidence. In the circumstances, the Registrar had no discretion but to treat
the application for registration as having been abandoned by Kaveri.
9\. Second, he submitted that the Registrar had erred in not considering the
objections filed by the petitioner solely for the reason that both the
varieties (KMH-50 and 30V92) had qualified the DUS test. He submitted that the
Registrar had erred in concluding that the two varieties were required to be
construed as distinct and different inter se, without considering Pioneer's
objections. He contended that the Registrar had failed to consider that KMH-50
was similar to Pioneer's variety 30V92 and registration of the same would
infringe Pioneer's Intellectual Property Rights. He submitted that Pioneer had
cogent and irrefutable scientific evidence such as pedigree information, DNA
Fingerprints, research records to establish that KMH-50 infringed Pioneer's
rights. He submitted that the Test reports furnished by Pioneer established
that KMH-50 was genetically similar to 30V92.
10\. Third, he submitted that that Kaveri's application for registration of
KMH-50 could be accepted only after the DUS test was conducted. The
application was required to be advertised thereafter for the purposes of
enabling concerned parties to object. He submitted that in this view, W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 8 of 49 objections could not be rejected only on
the basis of the DUS Test as the same was not conclusive against the opponent
filing an opposition.
11\. Mr Pravin Anand, learned counsel appearing for Pioneer supplemented the
arguments advanced by Mr Chandra. In addition, he submitted that Pioneer had
right to oppose Kaveri's application by challenging the truth and veracity of
its statements made in its application. He referred to Section 18 of the Act
which specifies the information to be disclosed in an application for
registration of variety. In terms of the said Section, an applicant is
required to make declaration that genetic material or parental material
acquired for breeding evolving or developing the variety has been lawfully
acquired. Further, Kaveri was required to give complete passport data of the
parental lines from which the variety had been derived alongwith the
geographical location in India from where the genetic material has been taken.
Kaveri was also required to provide information relating to contribution of
other entities in breeding, evolving or developing of the variety. He
submitted that Pioneer was entitled to oppose the registration on the ground
that the statements made in the application were incorrect. Pioneer had,
accordingly, asserted that the genetic material of KMH-50 was similar to that
of 30V92 and Kaveri had misappropriated the germplasm of 30V92. These
objections could not be rejected only on the ground that Kaveri's variety had
qualified DUS Test.
12\. Lastly, Mr Anand submitted that the results of the DUS Test, in fact, did
not conclusively indicate that the two varieties were different. He referred
to the impugned order dated 27.08.2013, wherein the W.P.(C) 6470/2013 &
6208/2014 Page 9 of 49 Registrar had held that Pioneer's variety 30V92 was
found to be distinct in comparison to reference varieties for character 12 and
character 23. Similarly, the Registrar had found that Kaveri's variety KMH-50
was distinct in comparison to reference varieties for character 12 and 24. He
submitted that the values for character 12 and 23 were identical in case of
KMH-50 and 30V92 and, therefore, they could not be considered as distinct from
each-other in respect of those characters. He stated that insofar as character
24 is concerned, the values of KMH-50 as grown in New Delhi and at Hyderabad
were identical to the value of Pioneer's 30V92, which was grown in New Delhi.
However, they were different from the values of 30V92 as grown in Hyderabad.
He submitted that character 24 related to coloration of glumes of cob and
minor changes in coloration could occur due to various differences in the
climatic conditions of the seasons in which such plants were grown. Therefore,
the DUS tests did not conclusively establish that the two varieties in
question were different.
13\. Mr Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for Kaveri countered
the aforesaid submissions. First of all, he submitted that Kaveri had no
intention to abandon its application. He stated that Kaveri had withdrawn its
writ petition (W.P.(C) 6819/2011) on 29.05.2013 and had immediately written to
the Registrar to register its variety since it had qualified the DUS test. He
submitted that this clearly indicated that Kaveri's intention was not to
abandon the application for registration of KMH-50.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 10 of 49
14\. He referred to the decisions of this Court in Telefonaktiebolaget LM
Ericsson (Publ) v. Union of India and Anr.: W.P.(C) 9126/2009, decided on
11.03.2010 and Ferid Allani v. Union of India and Ors.: W.P.(C) 6836/2006,
decided on 25.02.2008 in support of its contention that in absence of any
conscious act on part of Kaveri indicating its intention to abandon the
application, the same could not be presumed. He also referred to Rule 31(4) of
the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Rules, 2003 (hereafter
'the 2003 Rules') and submitted that in terms of the said sub-rule, the
Registrar was required to decide the opposition on merits even in cases where
the applicant had not submitted a counter-statement. He contended that in view
of the aforesaid sub-rule, it was not open for Pioneer to claim that Kaveri
had abandoned its application and no decision on merits could be rendered by
the Registrar.
15\. Next, Mr Bhushan submitted that it was not necessary that the DUS Test be
conducted prior to acceptance of an application. He referred to Regulation 11
of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Regulations, 2006
(hereafter 'the 2006 Regulations') and submitted that the test referred to
under Section 19(1) of the Act was only for the purpose to evaluate whether
the seeds, submitted alongwith the application, conform to the standards as
notified under the Seeds Act,1966. He submitted that in terms of Section 15(2)
of the Act, an extant variety was required to be registered if it conforms to
the DUS criteria. He submitted that since in the present case, the DUS Test
had established that Kaveri's variety KMH-50 conforms to the DUS W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 11 of 49 criteria, it was required to be
registered. He submitted that there was no requirement for inter se comparison
of the two varieties.
16\. Next, he submitted that the DUS Test reports clearly established that
Kaveri's variety KMH-50 was distinct from Pioneer's 30V92. He referred to the
comparative chart of the DUS test and submitted that Kaveri had achieved the
characteristics as claimed by it in respect of Characters 21, 22 and 24 in
both the centres where the test was carried out. He submitted that Pioneer was
unable to achieve uniformity in respect of those characteristics at both the
centres and, therefore, Pioneer could not claim that its variety was identical
to KMH-50 in respect of characteristics 21, 22 and 24. He submitted that
wherever an applicant's variety achieves the character as claimed and is
consistent across the centres, the said character is considered to be uniform
and stable. He submitted that the comparison between two varieties can only be
made in respect of such characteristics which are claimed and consistently
established. He submitted that on the basis of the DUS criteria, the
petitioner's variety could not be considered as same as KMH-50.
17\. Lastly, he submitted that Pioneer had no right to insist on conducting a
DNA Test. He referred to Rule 29 of the 2003 Rules and submitted that such
test could be conducted only in case where the DUS test had fail to establish
the requirement of distinctiveness. And, it could be done only at the instance
of the applicant and not any third party.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 12 of 49
Reasoning and Conclusion
18\. It would be apposite to examine the scheme of the relevant provisions of
the Act at the outset.
19\. The Act was enacted to establish "the effective system for protection of
plant varieties, the rights of farmers and plant breeders and to encourage the
development of new varieties of plants" as indicated by the Preamble of the
Act. The Preamble also indicates that the Act was enacted pursuant to India's
ratification on the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). In terms of Paragraph 3(b) of Article 27 of
the TRIPS Agreement "all members were required to provide for protection of
plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by
any combination thereof".
20\. As explained in Emergent Genetics India Pvt. Ltd. v. Shailendra Shivam
and Ors. 2011(125) DRJ 173, Plant variety rights are species of intellectual
property protection conferred upon breeders of new plant varieties. These
rights are a result of Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of
Plants of 1961 adopted in Paris (and revised in 1972, 1978 and 1991) as well
as the TRIPS Agreement.
21\. The word "Variety" is defined under Clause (za) of Section 2 of the Act
in the following terms:
> "(za) "variety", means a plant grouping except micro- organism within a
> single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, which can be--
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 13 of 49
> (i) defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given
> genotype of that plant grouping;
> (ii) distinguished from any other plant grouping by expression of at least
> one of the said characteristics; and
> (iii) considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being
> propagated, which remains unchanged after such propagation, and includes
> propagating material of such variety, extant variety, transgenic variety,
> farmers' variety and essentially derived variety. and includes propagating
> material of such variety , extant variety, transgenic variety, farmers'
> variety and essentially derived variety."
22\. Concededly, both the varieties (KMH-50 and 30V92) are Extant Varieties
within the meaning of Clause (j) of Section 2 of the Act which is set out
below:-
> "(j) "extant variety" means a variety available in India which is--
> (i) notified under section 5 of the Seeds Act, 1966 (54 of 1966); or
> (ii) farmers' variety; or
> (iii) a variety about which there is common knowledge; or
> (iv) any other variety which is in public domain;"
> 23\. Section 13 of the Act provides for maintenance of a Register called the
> National Register of Plant Variety. It is further enacted that the names of
> all registered plant varieties with the names and addresses of the
> respective breeders, the rights of such breeders in respect of the
> registered varieties, the particulars of the denomination of each registered
> variety, its seeds or other propagating material along with W.P.(C)
> 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 14 of 49 specification of salient features
> thereof and such other matters as may be prescribed, shall be entered in the
> National Register of Plant Varieties. The said Register would be kept under
> the control and management of the Authority.
24\. Chapter III of the Act (containing Section 14 to 23) provides for
provisions for registration of the plant varieties. Any person specified under
Section 16 of the Act - namely (a) any person claiming to be breeder of the
variety; or (b) any successor of the breeder of the variety; or (c) assignee
of the breeder of the variety in respect of the right to make such
application; or (d) any farmer or group of farmers or community of farmers
claiming to be the breeder of the variety; or (e) any person authorised by any
such person(s) to make application on his behalf; or (f) any university or
publicly funded agricultural institution claiming to be the breeder of the
variety - is entitled to make an application to the Registrar for registration
of any variety.
25\. Section 15 of the Act sets out the criteria for registration of
varieties. Section 15 of the Act is set out below:
> "15. Registrable varieties.--(1) A new variety shall be registered under
> this Act if it conforms to the criteria of novelty, distinctiveness,
> uniformity and stability.
> (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1), an extant
> variety shall be registered under this Act within a specified period if it
> conforms to such criteria of distinctiveness, uniformity and stability as
> shall be specified under the regulations.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 15 of 49
> (3) For the purposes of sub-sections (1) and (2), as the case may be, a new
> variety shall be deemed to be--
> (a) novel, if, at the date of filing of the application for registration for
> protection, the propagating or harvested material of such variety has not
> been sold or otherwise disposed of by or with the consent of its breeder or
> his successor for the purposes of exploitation of such variety--
> (i) in India, earlier than one year; or
> (ii) outside India, in the case of trees or vines earlier than six years, or
> in any other case, earlier than four years, before the date of filing such
> application:
> Provided that a trial of a new variety which has not been sold or otherwise
> disposed of shall not affect the right to protection:
> Provided further that the fact that on the date of filing the application
> for registration, the propagating or harvested material of such variety has
> become a matter of common knowledge other than through the aforesaid manner

26\. As is apparent from Sub-section (1) of Section 15 of the Act, a new
variety can be registered only if it conforms to the criteria of novelty,
distinctiveness, uniformity and stability. However, an extant variety does not
require to conform to the criteria of novelty; it can be registered provided
it conforms to the criteria of distinctiveness, uniformity and stability
(DUS).
27\. In terms of Section 15(3)(b) of the Act, a variety would be distinct if
its distinguishable by at least one essential characteristic from any other
variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge.
28\. The expression "essential characteristics" is defined under Clause (h) of
Section 2 of the Act, which reads as under:-
> "2(h) "essential characteristics" means such heritable traits of a plant
> variety which are determined by the expression of one or more genes of other
> heritable determinants that contribute to the principle features,
> performance or value of the plant variety;"
29\. Thus, in order for a variety to be distinct, it must have a heritable
trait, which is distinct from other varieties.
30\. Before proceedings further, it is necessary to refer to Section 18, 19,
20, 21 and 22 and 24 of the Act, which are set out below:-

32\. One of the principal controversy raised in the present petition is
whether Section 19 of the Act refers to a DUS test or a limited test for
evaluating whether the seeds and the parental material conform to the
standards as specified. It is Pioneer's case that the test to be conducted in
terms of Section 19 of the Act is a DUS test and an application for
registration cannot be accepted unless such test has been conducted.
33\. A plain reading of Section 19(1) of the Act indicates that every
applicant is required to make available such quantity of seeds for the
purposes of conducting tests "to evaluate whether the seeds of such variety
along with parental material conform to the standards as may be specified by
regulations". The Authority has notified the 2006 Regulations (the Protection
of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 25
of 49 Regulations, 2006) in exercise of powers conferred under the Act.
Regulation 11 of the 2006 Regulations is relevant and is set out below:-
> "11. Standards for evaluating seeds or variety during tests.
> The test to be conducted for evaluation of a variety to be referred under
> the Act shall conform to the criteria of distinctness, uniformity and
> stability test guidelines published by the Authority in the Journal of
> Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority and shall be
> revised and updated from time to time with the prior information to the
> Central Government. The Standards for evaluating seeds during tests under
> sub-section (1) of section 19 shall be such as notified under Seeds Act,
> 1966 or further amendments to that effect."
34\. It is clear from the above that the test to be conducted for evaluation
of the variety is required to conform to the test guidelines as published by
the Authority for evaluating whether the variety conforms the criteria of
distinctiveness, uniformity and stability (DUS). Regulation 11 further
specifies that the standards for evaluating the seeds during tests shall be
such as notified under the Seeds Act, 1966.
35\. In view of the above, the contention that the tests referred to under
Section 19(1) of the Act only pertains to evaluating whether the seeds
conformed to the standards as notified under the Seeds Act, 1966, is
erroneous. The tests referred to under Section 19(1) of the Act also include
tests for determining whether the variety conforms to the DUS criteria. In
terms of Regulation 11 of the said 2006 Regulations, such tests are required
to be conducted in conformity with the guidelines as published by the
Authority.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 26 of 49
36\. At this stage, it is also relevant to refer to Protection of Plant
Varieties and Farmers Rights (Criteria for Distinctiveness, Uniformity and
Stability for Registration) Regulations, 2009 (hereafter "2009 Regulations").
Regulation 4 of the 2009 Regulations provides that the DUS criteria shall be
determined by conducting field test for one season at two locations. The said
Regulation 4 is set out below:-
> "4. Criteria of Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability for registration
> of variety about which there is Common Knowledge.‒(1) The criteria for
> distinctiveness, uniformity and stability for registration of a variety
> about which there is a common knowledge shall be determined by conducting a
> field test for one season at two locations for the purpose of confirming the
> distinctiveness, uniformity and stability following the descriptors and plot
> size as may be specified in the Journal.
> (2) Any person who applies for registration under clause (b) of Section 14
> of the Act shall submit half the quantity of seeds as divided into five
> equal numbers of packets for the purpose of field test and also for storing
> in the National Gene Bank and the seed supply procedures shall be such as
> may be specified in the Journal."
37\. Any doubt as to the test to be conducted under Section 19 of the Act is
put to rest by a plain reading of Rule 29 of the 2003 Rules, which is set out
below:-
> "29. Manner and method for conducting tests under section 19.-(1) (a) The
> Authority shall charge separate fees for conducting DUS test and special
> test on each variety.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 27 of 49
> (b) The special tests shall be conducted only when DUS testing fails to
> establish the requirement of distinctiveness.
> (c) The DUS testing shall be field and multi-location based for at least two
> crop seasons and special tests be laboratory based.
> (d) The fee for DUS and special tests shall be such as provided in column
> (3) of the Second Schedule for the purpose.
> (2) If the Registrar, after initial scrutiny of the application for
> registration, is satisfied that the application is in order, he shall notify
> the applicant to deposit the requisite fee, as specified in column (3) of
> the Second Schedule, within a period of two months for conducting the DUS
> test.
> (3) On receipt of the fee, demanded under sub-rule (1), the Registrar shall
> consider the application for further processing.
> (4) The DUS test shall be necessary for all new varieties except essentially
> derived variety.
> (5) The manner of testing essentially derived varieties shall be decided by
> the Authority on a case-to-case basis.
> (6) The DUS test shall be conducted on a minimum of two locations.
> (7) The Authority may recognise and empanel institutions having adequate
> facilities for conducting DUS or special tests in the country for conducting
> such tests.
> (8) The Authority shall notify the adopted methods of conducting the DUS and
> special tests.
> (9) The Authority shall develop and publish in its journal guidelines for
> the DUS test for each crop.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 28 of 49
> (10) The samples of seeds or propagules in respect of which an application
> for registration has been made and parental lines under registration
> submitted for the DUS and special tests and deposited at the National Gene
> Bank shall present the maintainable standards of generic purity, and
> uniformity and germination, sanitary and phytosanitary standards."
38\. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 29 of the 2003 Rules makes it clear that after
initial scrutiny, if the Registrar is satisfied that the application is in
order, he shall call upon the applicant to deposit the requisite fee within a
period of two months for conducting the DUS Test.
39\. In view of the above, there can be little doubt that on receipt of the
application, if the same is found to be in order then the next stage is to
conduct the tests under Section 19 of the Act, which is the test to ascertain
whether the Authority conforms to the DUS criteria.
40\. The next question to be examined is whether the DUS test have to be
conducted prior to acceptance of the application as contemplated under Section
20 of the Act.
41\. It is Pioneer's case that an application can be accepted only once a DUS
test has been conducted. This is disputed by Kaveri and it is contended on its
behalf that the DUS test could be conducted at any time and the same is not
necessary for acceptance of an application.
42\. As observed above, the first stage after receipt of the application for
registration under Section 14 of the Act is to examine whether the same is in
order. If the application is complete and in order, the W.P.(C) 6470/2013 &
6208/2014 Page 29 of 49 Registrar is required to notify the applicant to
deposit the fees for conducting the DUS Test. In terms of Sub-rule (3) of Rule
29 of the 2003 Rules, the application can be considered for further processing
by the Registrar only after the fee demanded for conducting the DUS Test is
deposited. Thus, plainly, the application cannot be accepted unless the fee
for the DUS Test is deposited.
43\. In terms of Section 20 of the Act, the Registrar is required to accept
the application filed after making such enquiry as it thinks fit with respect
to the particulars contained in such application. It is open for the Registrar
to accept the applications absolutely, or subject to such conditions as may
deem fit. At this stage, the Registrar can also reject the application if he
finds that it does not comply with the requirements of the Act or the Rules
and Regulations made thereunder.
44\. The language of Section 20 of the Act is wide. Although, it does not
expressly mandate that the Registrar is required to await the result of the
DUS Test before accepting the application, however, it does require the
Registrar to make an enquiry in respect of the particulars contained in the
application in order to make an informed decision whether to accept the
application or reject the same. If on making an enquiry, the Registrar is of
the view that the application does not comply with the requirements of the
Act, Rules or Regulations made thereunder, he may either call upon the
applicant to amend the application or reject the same. It is not necessary for
the Registrar to await the results of the DUS Test if he is otherwise
satisfied that the application does not comply with the requirements of the
Act. However, W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 30 of 49 if he is otherwise
finds no reason to reject the application out rightly, it would be necessary
for him to await the DUS Test as the said test would confirm whether the
variety conforms to the DUS criteria. Concededly, conformity with the DUS
Criteria is essential for any variety to be registered. Therefore, it would
not be possible for the Registrar to accept an application if he is not
satisfied that the variety conforms to the DUS criteria.
45\. The contention that the Registrar can accept the application results
awaiting the DUS Test, is erroneous. The Scheme of the Act is unambiguous.
Once the Registrar accepts an application, he is bound to register the variety
unless an opposition is filed under Section 21(3) of the Act and the Registrar
finds merit in such opposition. This is clear from the provisions of Section
24(1) of the Act, which expressly provides that the Registrar shall register
the variety and issue a certificate of registration in cases where an
application for registration of a variety (other than an essentially derived
variety) has been accepted and either (a) the application has not been opposed
and the time of notice of opposition has expired; or (b) the application has
been opposed and opposition has been rejected.
46\. It is clear from the above that the Registrar had no discretion to reject
an application once he has accepted the same and no opposition has been filed
by any person on advertisement of such application. It follows from the above
that the Registrar must be fully satisfied that the candidate variety conforms
to the DUS criteria before accepting the application for registration of the
variety. He is, thereafter, required to W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 31
of 49 advertise the said application and his examination is confined to the
opposition that may be filed pursuant to such advertisement.
47\. If Kaveri's contention is accepted that it is not necessary for the
Registrar to await the results of the DUS Test before accepting an
application, it would lead to an unacceptable situation in a case where no
opposition is filed and the DUS test are negative. In such cases, by virtue of
Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, the Registrar would be required to register the
variety even though it is not registrable on account of failing the DUS Test.
The Scheme of Chapter III of the Act regarding registration of the varieties
makes it clear that qualifying the DUS test is an essential criterion for
acceptance of an application under Section 20 of the Act.
48\. The next question to be examined is whether Pioneer's opposition was
required to be rejected only on the ground that Kaveri's variety KMH-50 had
qualified the DUS Test. The answer to this question is clearly in the
negative. As discussed above, an application can be accepted only once the DUS
test is satisfied. The application is, thereafter, required to be advertised.
Such advertisement is to be made in the manner as prescribed under Rule 30 of
the 2003 Rules. The said Rule is set out below:-
> "30. Advertising of application for registration under section 21.- (1)
> Every application for registration of a variety which has been accepted and
> the details thereof including specifications shall, upon such acceptance
> under sub-section (1) of section 20, be advertised by the Registrar in the
> W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 32 of 49 manner specified in Form 01 of
> the Third Schedule.
> (2) In every such advertisement under sub-rule (1), the Registrar shall
> mention that place or places where a specimen of the variety may be
> inspected.
> (3) The contents of such advertisement shall include-
> (a) name, passport data and source of parental line or initial variety used
> to develop the variety in respect of which an application for registration
> has been made;
> (b) description of the variety bringing out its character profile as
> specified under the DUS test Schedule;
> (c) essential characteristics conferring distinctiveness to the variety; (d)
> important agronomic and commercial attributes of the variety;
> (e) photographs or drawings, if any, of the variety submitted by the
> applicant; and
> (f) claim, if any, on the variety."
49\. The details of the variety including photographs and drawings are
required to be advertised in order to enable a person interested in the matter
to object to the registration in a meaningful manner. As is apparent from Rule
30(3)(b) of the 2003 Rules, the advertisement is also required to describe the
variety to bring out its character profile as specified under the DUS Test
Schedule.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 33 of 49
50\. The opposition to registration can be made only on limited grounds as are
specified in Section 21(3) of the Act. A person can object to registration on
the ground that (a) he is entitled to breeders right against the applicant;
and/or (b) that the variety is not registrable under this Act; and/or (c) that
the grant of certificate of registration may not be in public interest; and/or
(d) that the variety may have adverse effect on the environment. Thus, an
objector may accept that the candidate variety conforms to the DUS criteria
and yet object to its registration on the ground that he has a breeders rights
against the applicant and/or that grant of registration would not be in public
interest and/or would have an adverse effect on the environment.
51\. In terms of Clause (b) of Section 21(3) of the Act, a person may also
raise an objection on the ground that the variety is not registrable including
that it does not qualify the DUS criteria. The DUS Test report is not binding
on the objector and he is at liberty to contest the DUS Test on any grounds as
available.
52\. In the aforesaid view, the contention that since Kaveri's variety has
qualified the DUS Test and therefore it was required to be registered
notwithstanding the opposition, is plainly erroneous and cannot be accepted.
53\. The next question to the examined is whether the Registrar is required to
consider all grounds on which an application has been opposed even though the
applicant has failed and neglected to file any counter statement to the same.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 34 of 49
54\. After an application has been advertised and a notice of opposition is
received, the same is required to be served on the applicant. In terms of sub-
section (4) of Section 21 of the Act, the applicant is required to send to the
Registrar a counter statement on the grounds on which he relies for his
application and if he does not do so, he is deemed to have abandoned his
application. The legislative intent is unambiguous; if the applicant does not
counter the opposition to establish his grounds for registration, the
application is to be treated as abandoned. It is obvious that in such cases,
there would be no requirement for the Registrar to proceed with the same. It
was also not disputed on behalf of Kaveri that if an application has been
abandoned, the Registrar is not required to proceed with the same. However, it
was contended that in the present case, Kaveri had not abandoned its
application. The implication of an applicant abandoning his application is
clearly that the said application is not required to be proceeded with any
further. Thus, in cases where an applicant is abandoned, it would not be
necessary for the Registrar to proceed with the same.
55\. Mr Bhushan has referred to Rule 31(4) of the 2003 Rules and contended
that even in cases where a counter statement has not been filed, the Registrar
is required to decide the opposition on merits. Rule 31(4) of the 2003 is set
out below for ready reference:-
> "(4) An applicant shall be entitled to submit point-wise counter statement
> to the opposition not later than two months from the date of service of the
> copy of the notice of opposition, failing which the Registrar shall decide
> the merits of the W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 35 of 49 opposition and
> notify his decision by giving reasons therefor."
56\. This Court is unable to accept that the Registrar would be required to
examine the opposition on merits even though the applicant has failed and
neglected to file a counter statement.
57\. There is no ambiguity in the language of Sub-Section 21 (4) of the Act
that if an applicant fails to file a counter statement on the grounds on which
he relies on for his application, he would by legal fiction deemed to have
abandoned his application. And, in such cases it would not be necessary for
the Registrar to consider the opposition on merits.
58\. The provisions of Rule 31(4) of the 2003 Rules cannot be read in a manner
which is repugnant to Section 21(4) of the Act. The 2003 Rules are a piece of
the subordinate legislation and cannot override the provisions of the parent
enactment (see: Novva Ads v. Secretary, Department of Municipal Administration
and Water Supply and Anr.: (2008) 8 SCC 42; St. Johns Teachers Training
Institute v. National Council for Teacher Education (2003) 3 SCC 1; Kalpataru
Agroforest Enterprises v. Union of India: (2002) 3 SCC 612). This Court is of
the view that provisions of Rule 31(4) of the 2003 Rules must be read in a
harmonious manner with the provisions of Section 21(4) of the Act.
59\. Rule 31 (4) of the 2003 Rules expressly provide that an applicant is
entitled to submit "point wise counter statement to the opposition", failing
which the Registrar shall decide the merits of the opposition and W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 36 of 49 notify his decisions. Thus, in a case
where the applicant does not submit a point wise statement - which he is
entitled to in terms of Rule 31(4) of the 2003 Rules - the Registrar shall
decide the opposition on merits and give reasons for its decision. The
Registrar is not required to provide a further opportunity to the applicant to
file a point wise counter statement. But, in cases where the applicant fails
to file a counter statement to the opposition, he would deemed to have
abandoned the application and, in such cases, there would be no requirement
for the Registrar to proceed further with the same. The requirement of the
Registrar to decide the merits of the opposition must be confined to cases
where counter statement has been filed, however, the same is either not in
conformity with the Rules or is not "point wise".
60\. This Court may now proceed to examine the Pioneer's challenge to the
impugned orders and the impugned letter bearing the aforesaid discussions in
mind.
61\. The first and foremost question to be examined is whether Kaveri is
deemed to have abandoned his application for registration as it had failed to
file its response to the objections filed by Pioneer. Pioneer had filed its
objections, inter alia, alleging that the candidate variety (KMH-
50) was essentially identical/highly similar to Pioneer's variety 30V92. It is
Pioneer's case that it had developed the said variety from "Pioneer's
proprietary genetics through many years of research and breeding effort and
significant expenditure". Pioneer had claimed that its variety 30V92 was being
commercially sold by Pioneer since 2003 and its approximate annual sales was
₹125-130 crores.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 37 of 49
62\. Pioneer claimed that certain officials of its group had, on a visit to a
test centre, observed that a similar variety of Maize (KMH-50) was being grown
for DUS Testing. According to Pioneer, since the said variety was identical or
highly similar to its variety, the registration of the said variety was
adverse to Pioneer's interest. Pioneer also claimed that it was a prior
applicant for registration under the Act and it was first to commercialize
"the variety". A plain reading of the opposition clearly indicates that
Pioneer had founded its opposition on the basis that KMH-50 was identical to
its own variety.
63\. In addition to the above, Pioneer had also filed an application under
Section 24(5) of the Act stating that it had caused the test to be conducted
to determine the genetic similarities/dissimilarities between KMH-50 and
30V92. It had obtained samples of the seeds of KMH-50 from the market and the
test conducted on the said seeds indicated that KMH-50 has a similarity range
with 30V92 between 99.45% to 99.8%. Pioneer also claimed that the variation in
the genetic profile was within the limits of error which was +/- 1 to 2%.
Pioneer alleged that almost 100% similarity between KMH-50 and 30V92 based on
evidence filed by the petitioner, clearly suggests that respondent [Pioneer]
has misappropriated the germplasm of 30V92 under the denomination of KMH-50.
The said allegations remained uncontroverted. Kaveri did not file any counter
statement or produce any evidence to establish that it had developed KMH-50
from lawfully procured parental lines or other material. Thus, by virtue of
Section 21(4) of the Act, Kaveri's application was deemed to have been
abandoned.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 38 of 49
64\. Mr Bhushan had earnestly contended that the sequence of events and the
conduct of Kaveri clearly establishes that it had no intention of abandoning
its application and, therefore, could not be presumed to have been abandoned
its application. The said contention is unpersuasive. Section 21(4) of the Act
contains all legal fiction by virtue of which failure to file a counter
statement has to be construed as abandoning of the application. In St. Aubyn
v. Attorney-General : (1951) 2 All ER 473, Lord Radcliffe had observed as
under:-
> "The word 'deemed' is used a great deal in modern legislation. Sometimes it
> is used to impose for the purposes of a statute an artificial construction
> of a word or phrase that would not otherwise prevail. Sometimes it is used
> to put beyond doubt a particular construction that might otherwise be
> uncertain. Sometimes it is used to give a comprehensive description that
> includes what is obvious, what is uncertain and what is, in the ordinary
> sense, impossible. "
65\. In Consolidated Coffee Limited and Anr. v. Coffee Board, Bangalore :
(1980) 3 SCC 358, the Supreme Court had referred to the above passage and held
as under:-
> "A deeming provision might be made to include what is obvious or what is
> uncertain or to impose for the purpose of a statute an artificial
> construction of a word or phrase that would not otherwise prevail, but in
> each case it would be a question as to with what object the legislature has
> made such a deeming provision."
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 39 of 49
66\. The deeming provision under Section 21(4) of the Act must be read in a
purposive manner. Plainly, the legislative intent in including the deeming
provision is to provide for consequences of not filing a counter statement to
controvert the opposition. The Parliament in its wisdom has enacted that if
the grounds for opposition as set out are not countered by filing a counter
statement, the same must be read as the applicant abandoning his application.
This imposes an artificial construction on the act of not filing a counter
statement, which may not otherwise be readily inferred. In the present case,
Kaveri steadfastly avoided countering the allegations made by Pioneer and by
virtue of the deeming provision, this conduct has to be construed as Kaveri
abandoning its application. It was clearly not open for Kaveri to avoid
meeting the objections and yet pursue its application.
67\. The decisions of this Court in Ferid Allani v. Union of India & Ors.
(supra) and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) v. Union of India an Ors.
(supra) are of little assistance to Kaveri. In Ferid Allani's case, this Court
had considered the question whether the petitioner's application for grant of
patent was to be construed as abandoned on failure of the petitioner to
respond to the examination report within the prescribed time. In that case,
the petitioner had made a request for examination within the prescribed time.
He had also submitted its response to the first examination report within the
prescribed time, however, a second set out of objections were raised and it
was the petitioner's case that it had received the same subsequent to the time
provided for filing his response. It is in the aforesaid context W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 40 of 49 that the Court had examined whether the
time prescribed under Rule 24(B)(4)(ii) of the Patents Rules was mandatory.
After examining the scheme of the statutory provisions, the Court concluded
that the time period of three months, as provided under Rule 24(B)(4)(ii) of
the Patents Rules was directory and not mandatory. The Court also took note
that the Controller was also empowered under Rule 138 of the said Rules to
extend the time prescribed under Rule 24(B) of the said Rules. In the present
case, the issue is not whether the time for two months as prescribed for
filing a counter affidavit is mandatory or directory. Admittedly, Kaveri has
declined to file any counter statement to the opposition and it has not sought
any extension of time. Thus, even if it is held that the time period of two
months as specified under Section 21(4) of the Act is directory, it would be
of no benefit to Kaveri. The decision in Ferid Allani's case cannot be read as
an authority for the proposition that even if an applicant for a patent
declines to respond to objections, he would nonetheless be entitled to sustain
his application for a patent.
68\. Similarly, the decision of this Court in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
(PUBL) (supra) is also of no assistance to Kaveri. The decision in the said
case was rendered following the earlier decision of the Court in Ferid Allani.
Further, in the facts of that case, the Court found that the basic factual
condition for attracting the deemed fiction of abandonment was non-existent.
In that case, the petitioner had responded to the objections raised within the
prescribed time. It is also W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 41 of 49
relevant to refer to paragraph 14 of the said decision, which reads as under:-
> "14. Where in response to an examination report, an applicant does nothing
> by way of meeting the objections raised therein within the time stipulated,
> and does not seek extension of time for that purpose only then it can be
> said that such application should be "deemed to have been abandoned". If he
> has replied but such reply is not found satisfactory, even after a further
> opportunity if any is given, then the Controller should proceed to take a
> decision in terms of Section 15, after complying with Section 14 of the
> Act."
69\. It is clear from the above quoted passage that the Court had clarified
that if the applicant has done nothing by way of meeting the objection raised
within the time stipulated and does not seek extension of time for that
purpose, then his application would be deemed to have been abandoned. In the
present case, Kaveri had unequivocally stated it did not wish to file any
counter affidavit or any evidence. Thus, it had expressed its intention, in
unambiguous terms, to not to meet the allegations made by Pioneer in its
opposition.
70\. In view of the above, the impugned order dated 09.09.2014 is liable to be
set aside and it is not necessary to examine other questions in this regard.
Nonetheless, for the sake of completeness, this Court considers it apposite to
consider the other issues raised by the parties as well.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 42 of 49
71\. The next question to be decided is whether the Registrar erred in
rejecting Pioneer's opposition solely on the ground that the Kaveri's variety
KMH-50 had qualified the DUS criteria. The Registrar did not decide the
question whether Kaveri had abandoned its application but proceeded to hold
that the Kaveri's opposition had become infructuous in view of the DUS test
reports. The Registry simply followed the impugned order dated 27.08.2013,
which is subject matter of challenge in W.P. (C) 6470/2013 and proceeded to
hold that since both the varieties had been found to qualify the DUS Test,
Pioneer's opposition was infructuous. He also proceeded on the basis that the
DUS Test had not been contested.
72\. This Court is also of the view that the said decision is erroneous for
several reasons. First of all, the Registrar should not have proceeded on the
basis that the DUS Test was final and binding on Pioneer. As observed earlier,
the entire procedure adopted by the Registrar/Authority was contrary to the
scheme of the Act. The Registrar could not have accepted Kaveri's application
for registration of KMH-50 without the said variety qualifying the DUS Test.
The question of accepting the application and inviting objections would only
arise after KMH-50 had qualified the DUS Test. As stated hereinbefore, the DUS
Test report is not final and binding on the opponent and it was open for
Pioneer to raise any objections regarding the restorability of the said
variety in terms of Section 21(3)(b) of the Act. This would, obviously,
include objections to the DUS Test. Kaveri would be well within its right to
contend that the DUS Test was not conclusive to W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014
Page 43 of 49 establish that KMH-50 was not distinct from 30V92. However,
since the application was advertised prior to the DUS Test report being made
available, such objections could not be included in the opposition.
73\. The Registrar's view that the objections regarding DUS test ought to be
made by making a representation on inspection of the variety while the DUS
test is being conducted, is erroneous. As discussed earlier, the question of
raising objections arises only after the application has been accepted, which
is post the variety being found to conform to the DUS criteria. In terms of
Rule 30(2) of the 2003 Rules, such advertisement would also include
information as to the place where the candidate variety can be inspected. It
is at that stage that an opponent has the opportunity to inspect the variety
and, if necessary, point out errors in the DUS Test report by filing an
opposition.
74\. Secondly, the Registrar would also be required to consider whether the
statements made by Kaveri in its application were correct. Pioneer had alleged
in its application under Section 24(5) of the Act that Kaveri had
misappropriated the Germplasm in its submissions before the Registrar,
however, the Registrar had not considered the same only on the ground that
KMH-50 had qualified the DUS Test. Kaveri had filed an application claiming to
be the Breeder/successor of the Breeder of KMH-50 and Pioneer had, in effect,
claimed Breeder's right in opposition to such registration. However, the same
was also not considered by the Registrar.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 44 of 49
75\. The impugned order dated 9th September 2014 is liable to be set aside on
the aforesaid grounds as well.
76\. The next issue to be examined is with regard to the Pioneer's challenge
to the impugned order dated 27.08.2013 rejecting its application for
conducting a special test. The Registrar has rejected the Pioneer's
application, essentially, for three reasons. First, that in terms of Rule
29(1) of the Act, a special test could be conducted only if the DUS test had
failed. He concluded that since the DUS Test had not failed, a special test
could not be conducted. Second, that the registration was required to be
granted on the basis of DUS Test which is used for determining expression of
an essential characteristic. He proceeded on the basis that since the DUS test
had established that KMH-50 was distinct as being distinguishable in respect
of one essential characteristic, a special test was not required. The
Registrar also noted that if Pioneer had any objections regarding the variety,
it could have inspected the variety and made a representation in this regard.
Thirdly, he held that a special test would be of no relevance because both the
varieties had qualified for registration based on the DUS test.
77\. This Court is of the view that the reliance placed by the Registrar to
Rule 29(1) of the 2003 Rules is misplaced. Rule 29 only refers to the test to
be conducted under Section 19 of the Act. As discussed above, the said test
relates to the tests to be conducted or acceptance of an application for
registration of a variety. A provision for special test is made at the
instance of the applicant in cases where the DUS test fails.
W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 45 of 49
In other words, if the DUS test result does not indicate that the candidate
variety is distinguishable in one essential characteristic from the reference
varieties, it is open for the applicant to request for a special test to
establish that the candidate variety is distinct. Rule 29 has no application
in a case where an opponent request for a special test to establish its
allegation that germplasm of the candidate variety is identical to another
variety over which the opponent claims a breeder's right. Rule 29 does not
preclude any person opposing the registration of a variety or contesting the
registration of a variety to seek a special test to establish that the
candidate variety is not registrable or that the claims made in the
application for such registration are false. In the present case, Pioneer had
filed the application for a DNA test in support of its petition under Section
24(5) of the Act, wherein it was asserted that Kaveri had misappropriated the
germplasm of 30V92. Plainly, the said application could not have been rejected
on account of the provision of Section 19 of the Act or Rule 29 of the 2003
Rules.
78\. The contention that an application for DNA testing could not be
maintainable in cases where the DUS test was successful, is also erroneous.
The genetic structure of the seed determines its physical manifestation. The
genotype is manifested by the physical traits (phenotype) of the organism. It
is difficult to accept that two seeds with the identical genotype would have
stable different characteristics. The physical characteristics of an organism
is an expression of its genome. It is also necessary to note that the
expression "essential characteristics", as defined under Section 2(h) of the
Act, also means W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 46 of 49 heritable traits
of a plant variety which is determined by the expression of one or more genes
or other heritable determinants. It necessarily follows that if a variety is
distinct within the meaning of Section 15(3)(b) of the Act -that is, it is
distinguishable by at least one essential characteristic from any other
variety - it would necessarily follow that its genotype is also different
particularly in respect of the gene, that is, manifested by that essential
characteristic. Thus, the importance of examining the genotype of a plant in
order to determine whether it is distinct cannot be brushed aside when one
party seeks to contest the same, merely on the ground that DUS test conducted
under Section 19 of the Act is successful. This Court is also unable to concur
with the view that conduct of a DNA testing would be futile in cases where
there is a serious dispute as to the IPR rights regarding the variety.
79\. Having stated the above, this Court is also of the view that it is not
necessary that in every case a DNA test be conducted by the Registrar. It is
open for a party asserting IPR rights to establish that genetic structure of
the candidate variety is identical to the variety developed by it. Thus,
Pioneer was not precluded from establishing the genotype of KMH50 on the basis
of the test conducted by it.
80\. It is also contended on behalf of Pioneer that DUS test did not establish
that KMH-50 was distinct from 30V92. The Registrar had analysed the DUS test
of both the varieties and found that Pioneer's 30V92 was distinct with
reference to other varieties, namely, HM-4, HQPM-1, PRAKASH, Seed Tech 2324,
Vivek 9 and African Tall. Similarly, DUS test of KMH-50 was also conducted
with reference to W.P.(C) 6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 47 of 49 HM-4, HQPM-1,
PRAKASH, Seed Tech 2324, Vivek 9 and African Tall. According to the Registrar,
Pioneer's variety 30V92 was found distinct in comparison to reference
varieties for character 12 (Ear: Anthocyanin colouration of silks on day of
emergency); Character 23 (Ear: Colour of tope of grain) and KMH-50 was found
distinct from other reference varieties for Character (Ear: Anthocyanin
colouration of silks on the day of emergency) and character 24 (Ear:
Anthocyanin colouration of glumes of cobs). It is contended on behalf of
Pioneer that the said test reports did not established that KMH-50 and 30V92
were distinct in respect of the aforesaid characteristics. A tabular statement
indicating the values ascribed to those characteristics in respect of two
varieties grown in New Delhi and Hyderabad is set out below:

characteristics, in respect of which the two varieties were found to have
qualified the DUS test, are more or less identical when compared inter W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 48 of 49 se. However, this Court is not inclined to
examine the said controversy any further as the same has not been considered
in any of the impugned orders. However, it is obvious that if the question
whether the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 are different and distinct from each
other is required to be determined, a meaningful examination of their
essential characteristics would be relevant.
82\. In view of the above, the impugned orders dated 09.09.2014 and 27.08.2018
are set aside. The impugned letter dated 24.06.2013, to the extent that it
confirms that Kaveri's KMH-50 is eligible for registration under the Act, is
set aside. Pioneer's application for conducting the special test in the nature
of DNA profiling of the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 is restored to the file of
the Registrar for considering it afresh, if necessary.
83\. The petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. All pending
applications also stand disposed of.
84\. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

VIBHU BAKHRU, J
1\. The petitioner (hereafter 'Pioneer') is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., company incorporated in United States of
America. Pioneer claims that it is involved in the business of research,
development, breeding, production and marketing of plant varieties since the
year 1926. Respondent no.2 (Kaveri Seeds Limited
    81.     Prima        facie,      the       aforesaid   table   indicates   that        those
characteristics, in respect of which the two varieties were found to have
qualified the DUS test, are more or less identical when compared inter W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 48 of 49 se. However, this Court is not inclined to
examine the said controversy any further as the same has not been considered
in any of the impugned orders. However, it is obvious that if the question
whether the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 are different and distinct from each
other is required to be determined, a meaningful examination of their
essential characteristics would be relevant.
82\. In view of the above, the impugned orders dated 09.09.2014 and 27.08.2018
are set aside. The impugned letter dated 24.06.2013, to the extent that it
confirms that Kaveri's KMH-50 is eligible for registration under the Act, is
set aside. Pioneer's application for conducting the special test in the nature
of DNA profiling of the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 is restored to the file of
the Registrar for considering it afresh, if necessary.

1\. The petitioner (hereafter 'Pioneer') is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., company incorporated in United States of
America. Pioneer claims that it is involved in the business of research,
development, breeding, production and marketing of plant varieties since the
year 1926. Respondent no.2 (Kaveri Seeds Limited
    81.     Prima        facie,      the       aforesaid   table   indicates   that        those
characteristics, in respect of which the two varieties were found to have
qualified the DUS test, are more or less identical when compared inter W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 48 of 49 se. However, this Court is not inclined to
examine the said controversy any further as the same has not been considered
in any of the impugned orders. However, it is obvious that if the question
whether the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 are different and distinct from each
other is required to be determined, a meaningful examination of their
essential characteristics would be relevant.
82\. In view of the above, the impugned orders dated 09.09.2014 and 27.08.2018
are set aside. The impugned letter dated 24.06.2013, to the extent that it
confirms that Kaveri's KMH-50 is eligible for registration under the Act, is
set aside. Pioneer's application for conducting the special test in the nature
of DNA profiling of the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 is restored to the file of
the Registrar for considering it afresh, if necessary.
83\. The petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. All pending
                                    Advocates.
