which was not available before the Adjudicating authority at the time of
passing the adjudication order in 2010. Secondly Adjudicating authority has
not considered Para 2 of the CBEC Circular No. 128/10/2010-ST dated 24.08.2010
which is binding on the filed formations. Further the issue of free supply of
goods/ sale of goods in a works contract and its inclusion in the assessable
value, is required to be examined in the light of judicial pronouncement of
Delhi High Court in the case of G.D. Builders vs. UOI [2013 (32) STR 673
(Del.)], read with Rule -2A of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules,
2006. In the light of these observations and in the interest of justice,
therefore, the matter is required to be remanded back to the Adjudicating
authority to decide the cases afresh in de-novo proceedings by affording an
opportunity of personal hearing to the appellant to explain their stand.
7\. In view of the above observations, appeals filed by the appellants are
allowed, to the extent indicated hereinabove, by way of remand to the
Adjudicating authority.
