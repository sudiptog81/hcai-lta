delay of more than 8 years, ignoring the fact that the copies of the document
were supplied after 19.7.2000 i.e., the date from which the limitation starts
to run. Accordingly, there is 356 days delay. The petitioners have properly
explained the delay. The appellate court did not consider the settled
principle of law that in view of Section 24 of the Act, Section 5 of the

70\. Accordingly, the delay in filing the appeal is condoned while setting
aside the impugned order dated 9.5.2006 in Case No.F1/1188/2006 passed by the
2nd respondent and the 2nd respondent - Joint Collector is directed to hear
the appeal filed by the petitioner and since it is the oldest matter, the 2nd
respondent is directed to dispose of the appeal on merits and in accordance
with law within 3 months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. In
the meanwhile, both parties are directed to maintain status quo till the
disposal of the appeal.
