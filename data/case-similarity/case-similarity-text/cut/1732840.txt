was decide to grant exemption at a limited scale.
In our opinion, the plea of change of policy trade on the basis of resource
crunch should have been sufficient for dismissing the respondent's case based
on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Public interest demanded modification
of the earlier I.P.R.
Moreover, as it has been noted earlier that the I.P.R. itself had not granted
any exemption but had indicated that orders will be issued by various
departments for granting the exemptions. The exemption order under sales tax
could only be issued under Section 6 which could be amended or withdrawn
altogether. This is expressly provided by Section
6\. If the respondent acted on the basis of a notification issued under
Section 6 it should have known that such notification was liable to be amended
or rescinded at any point of time, if the Government felt that it was
necessary to do so in public interest. That is exactly what has happened in
this case.
