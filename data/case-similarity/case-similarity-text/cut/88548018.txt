in the present plaint, which is in a quia timet action, are prima facie
sufficient to show that Defendant No.2 "carries on business" in Delhi and that
the prima facie the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction of this
Court.
32\. Needless to clarify that the final determination on whether the Court has
territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit will have to await the
completion of the trial as it is a mixed question of law and fact. On the
basis of the CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 17 of 18 averment in the plaint at
this stage it is not necessary for the Court to, and in fact it cannot,
conclusively hold that this Court either has or lacks the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
33\. In that view of the matter, this application is dismissed. However, a
specific issue concerning territorial jurisdiction of the Court will be framed
for determination at the appropriate stage.
