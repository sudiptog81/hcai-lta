our decision that the effect of an agreement of the kind in Exhibit B was to
constitute the Chaukidari Chakaran lands into a distinct Patni will not result
in any injustice to the parties. On the other hand, the rule that a portion of
a Patni should not be sold being one intended for the benefit of the
Patnidars, there is no reason why an agreement entered into by them with the
Zamindars providing for the sale of a portion, thereof-which is really to
their advantage, should not be given effect to. Having anxiously considered
the matter, we have come to the conclusion that Exhibit B creates a distinct
Patni, that the sale thereof on May 15, 1937, is valid, and that the plaintiff
has therefore acquired a good title to the suit lands under the grant dated
February 13, 1941. In this view, it is unnecessary to express any opinion on
the point that was the subject of considerable argument before us as to
whether it is open to the defendants to raise the invalidity of the sale held
on May 15, 1937, in answer to this action, they not having taken steps to have
set it aside, as provided in s. 14 of the Regulation.
