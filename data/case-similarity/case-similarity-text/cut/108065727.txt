the purpose behind having such major penalties, which are explicitly provided
for under Article 311 of the Constitution, would be obliterated.
38\. Still further, the appellant’s actions would most probably have caused
huge consequential losses to BPCL and lowered the reputation of the CISF
amongst members of the public. Given the paramilitary Page | 22 nature of the
appellant’s force, a sense of integrity, commitment, discipline, and
camaraderie is paramount. 10 This expectation is only heightened in the case
of the appellant given how he was specifically tasked with weeding out
corruption and conducting surprise raids. Once shattered through acts of
intimidation, forgery, and corruption; only the severest penalty ought to be
imposed.
CONCLUSION
39\. In light of the above discussion, we do not find any merit in this appeal
which is accordingly dismissed.
