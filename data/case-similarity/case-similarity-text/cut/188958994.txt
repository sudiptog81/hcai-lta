Conclusion
30\. Having regard to our finding on question (iv) it has to be held that the
suit being one for enforcement of a mortgage by sale, it should be tried by
the court and not by an arbitral tribunal. Therefore we uphold the dismissal
of the application under section 8 of the Act, though for different reasons.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed. We however make it clear that we have not
recorded any finding, nor expressed any opinion, on the merits of the claims
