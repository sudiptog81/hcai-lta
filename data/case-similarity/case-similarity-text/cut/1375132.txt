proviso to Section 6(1) and its explanation, inserted into the L.A. Act by the
L.A. (Amendment) Act, 1984\. Such examination cannot, therefore, be understood
as laying down that notwithstanding the lapse of time or laches in raising a
legal ground in a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution or a
proceeding under Article 136 of the Constitution there is an obligation on the
part of the court concerned to examine such fresh ground. In fact, in relation
to acquisition proceeding involving acquisition of land for public purposes,
the court concerned must be averse to entertain writ petitions involving the
challenge to such acquisition where there is avoidable delay or laches since
such acquisition, if set aside, would not only involve enormous loss of public
money but also cause undue delay in carrying out projects meant for general
public good. When a fresh ground of attack to acquisition proceedings, even if
it involves purely a question of law, its entertainment cannot be governed by
a principle different from that which governs entertainment of writ petitions
