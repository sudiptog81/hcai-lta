to these payments a capital character. The payments are to be made for an
indefinite period until they were commuted by mutual agreement. Though the
payments are fixed with reference to the profits, they are indirectly related
to the turnover. The payments were not related to any specified sum which was
agreed upon by the parties as purchase price of the business. Such
circumstances were taken to indicate that the payments are of revenue nature
in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. 36/49 Holdings Ltd. In that case certain
periodical payments were taken to be revenue expenditure for the following
reasons:
(1) The payments were to be made in perpetuity until the right to commute is
exercised;
(2) the payments were related to the turnover which were the trading activity,
and the sums paid were in that respect not dissimilar from royalties;
(3) the sums payable under the second category were not tied in any way or
related in any way to any special sum whatsoever.
