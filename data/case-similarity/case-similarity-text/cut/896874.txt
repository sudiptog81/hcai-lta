tampered with, and that is the only hypothesis on which the discrepancy in
weight can be explained. The least that can be said in the facts of the case
is that there is serious doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case.
16\. There is one other aspect of the matter. PW-2, the panch witness
associated in this case appears to be a stock witness. The other panch witness
has not been examined. PW-2 admitted in very clear terms that he was earlier
associated in two other cases under N.D.P.S. Act as panch witness. In both
those cases, PSI Thorat was the investigating officer. On 14 th December,
1994, he had been summoned by PSI Thorat and acted as a panch witness in the
case against P.C. Kulbi, who as noticed earlier disclosed the complicity of
the appellant. Thereafter, in the instant case, he was requested by PW-4 to
act as a panch witness. It appears that PSI Thorat was also associated with
this case as he was present with PW-4 when P.C. Kulbi was apprehended and
thereafter when the appellant herein was apprehended and searched at the
instance of the aforesaid Kulbi.
