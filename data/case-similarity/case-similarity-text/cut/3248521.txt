of the Act as charged by AO/DRP is not sustainable because when duty is on the
payer to deduct tax at  44 ITA No.1817/Del/2015 source, on failure of the
payer to deduct the TDS no interest can be charged from the payee/taxpayer u/s
234B of the Act. Consequently, this ground is determined in favour of the
taxpayer.

purposes.
Order pronounced in open court on this 28th day of November, 2019.
