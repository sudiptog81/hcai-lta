was not for company. We see no reason to differ from their view. The mere fact
that after the acquisition the Government proposed to hand over, or, in fact,
handed over, a portion of the property acquired for development to the
cooperative housing societies would not make the acquisition one for company'.
Nor are we satisfied that there is any merit in the contention that
compensation to be paid for the acquisition came from the consideration paid
by the cooperative societies. In the light of the averments in the counter
affidavit filed in the writ petitions here, it is difficult to hold that it
was cooperatives which provided the fund for the acquisition. Merely because
the Government allotted a part of the property to cooperative societies for
development, it would not follow that the acquisition was for cooperative
societies, and therefore, Part VII of the Act was attracted. It may be noted
that the validity of the notification under s. 4 and the declaration under s.
6 was in issue in Udai Ram Sharma and Others v. Union of India(1) and this
Court upheld their validity.
