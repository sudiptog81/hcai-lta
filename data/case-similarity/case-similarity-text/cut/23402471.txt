unequivocal inasmuch as it stipulates that it is clearly agreed and understood
that no difference or disputes shall be referable to arbitration if the
company has disputed or not accepted the liability. The High Court has fallen

(supra). Therefore, the only remedy which the respondent can take recourse to
is to institute a civil suit for mitigation of the grievances. If a civil suit
is filed within two months hence, the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation
Act, 1963 will enure to its benefit.

order passed by the High Court is set aside. In the facts and circumstances of
the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
