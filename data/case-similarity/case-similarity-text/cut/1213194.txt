Further, the whole imposition of assessment was left to the arbitrary
discretion of the officers not named in the Act without giving any remedy to
the assessees for questioning the correctness of any of the important stages
in the matter of assessment, such as ayacut, taram, rate or classification or
even in regard to the calculation of the figures. Not only the scheme of
classification, as pointed out by us earlier, has no reasonable relation to
the objects sought to be achieved viz., fixation and rationalisation of rates
but the arbitrary power of assessment conferred under the Act enables the
appropriate officers to make unreasonable discrimination between different
persons and lands. The Act, therefore, clearly offends Art. 14 of the
Constitution. In some of the appeals relating to Peddapuram and Kumara- puram
villages another point was raised, namely, that a special rate bad been fixed
which was neither for a single crop nor for a double crop and that, therefore,
they do not come under any of (1) [1966] 1 Mys. L.J. 351,359.
