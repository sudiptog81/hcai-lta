agency. Instead of repatriating it imme- diately the assessee obtained the
sanction of the Reserve Bank to utilise the commission in its business of
manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives for buying capital goods.
That was quite an independent transaction and it is the nature of this
transaction which has to be determined. In our view it was not a trading
transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and
locomotives; it was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for
capital goods, the first step to the acquisition of capital goods. If the
assessee had repatriated $36,123.02 and then after obtaining the sanction of
the Reserve Bank remitted $36,123.02 to the U.S.A., Mr. Sastri does not
contest that any profit made on devaluation would have been a capital profit.
But, in our opinion, the fact that the assessee kept the money there does not
make any difference especially, as we have pointed out, that it was a new
transaction which the assessee entered into, the transaction being the first
step to acquisition of capital goods.
