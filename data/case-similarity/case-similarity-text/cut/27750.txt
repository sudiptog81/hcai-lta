have also done so in detail. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the
examination of witnesses in a random manner and without the presence of the
Accused have not caused any prejudice to the Accused.
27\. We also found that apart from the reasons given in paragraph Nos. 23 and
24 of the impugned judgment, the trial Court has taken into consideration all
the relevant facts and circumstances and chosen to award sentence of
imprisonment against the Respondents 1 to 43. This Court has also
independently considered the submissions made on behalf of the Revision
Petitioners and also perused the testimonies of the concerned witnesses. We
find that the trial Court has properly appreciated the testimonies of
witnesses and has recorded sound and tenable reasons for awarding the sentence
of imprisonment against the said Respondents.
28\. In our considered opinion, the discretion exercised by the trial Court,
in awarding sentence of imprisonment cannot set to be arbitrary or
unreasonable.
