similar to that of the joint venture.
The submissions made by the respondent in IA No. 13512/2006 have been taken on
record and considered. The prayer made therein, therefore, stands satisfied.
I, accordingly, allow OMP No. 477/2006 to the extent of prayers (a) and (b)
and restrain the respondents, its affiliates or associates from participating,
negotiating, engaging in or being financially interested, directly or
indirectly in any other project for the manufacturing of Float Glass, or for
the fabrication of products made from Float Glass, or for the sale,
import/export of Float Glass or related products made from Float Glass in
India. The respondent shall also stand restrained from taking any steps in
setting up a wholly owned subsidiary in India for manufacturing in the same
field as GGL.
So far as prayer (c) and (d) are concerned, the same shall abide adjudication
in the writ proceedings which are stated to have been initiated by the
petitioner.
