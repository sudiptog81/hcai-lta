apply to cases where the revenue officer misunderstood the valid provisions of
the Act and assessed to tax incomes not assessable under the Act-because the
amount realised would not be valid revenue.
Similarly if the revenue officer by mere mistake in arithmetic demanded and
realised from an assessee more than was legally payable, the illegal excess
would not be valid revenue, and according to this argument, the jurisdiction
of the High Court to grant relief in respect thereof would not be barred. In
other words, the jurisdiction of the High Court would be barred under Section
226 of the Government of India Act, 1935, only in those cases where the
plaintiff on the merits was not entitled to succeed. In my opinion neither the
plain words of the Section nor the decision of the Judicial Committee in
Alcock, Ashdown and Company Limited, justify such an interpretation.
I am of opinion that Section 226 of the Government of India Act, 1935, is a
bar to our entertaining the preson suit, and that the plaint should therefore
be returned to the plaintiff for presentation to the proper court.
