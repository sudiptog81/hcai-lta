unfair: Therefore, the result of the interview test on merits cannot be
successfully challenged by a candidate who takes a chance to get selected at
the said interview and who ultimately finds himself to be unsuccessful."
Reference may also be made to the decision of this Court in Chandra Prakash
Tiwari Vs. Shakuntala Shukla [(2002) 6 SCC 127].
27\. No other point arises for consideration.
However, before parting with the case, we must make it clear that the
appellant in her anxiety to persuade this Court to set aside the promotion of
respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4 and to secure a writ of mandamus to grant her
seniority, cited number of  33 authorities in her written submissions. On
consideration, we find many of them are not relevant for the purposes of
disposal of this appeal and for that reason we have relied upon only such of
those judgments which are relevant to decide the appeal.
28\. We are unable to grant any relief to the appellant but appreciate the
manner in which the appellant presented her case before us.
