Plaintiff's carton does not arise.
48\. In any event, before considering the features of the rival cartons, the
Court must satisfy itself that the rival word marks are visually similar, and
only when it is satisfied, the Court may go on to consider whether the added
matter upon the Defendant's carton out-weighs the impression created by the
visual similarity of the marks themselves. I have observed hereinbefore that
the rival word marks are not similar. There is no visual or phonetic
similarity between the word marks. Hence, the question of considering the
similarities between the rival cartons, as suggested by the Plaintiff, does
not arise. In any event, even if I was to consider both the cartons, I do not
feel that both are so similar so as to outweigh the impression of
dissimilarity created by the rival word marks and thereby create any confusion
or deception.  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019
