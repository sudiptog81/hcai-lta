relation to those goods but could not be construed as acts done in furtherance
to the abetment done in relation to the contravention of the Customs laws in
India, so as to extend their penal liability in that regards. The act on their
part, which could render them liable to penal action, if committed in India,
is deemed to have ended as soon as they despatched the goods.
28\. Thus, with Customs Act, 1962 having force only within the whole of India,
and with no provisions incorporated therein to invest any extra territorial
jurisdiction, and with codified law of the Indian Parliament having
applicability only within India, the powers of the Collector exercising his
jurisdiction under the provisions of the Customs Act, would not stand extended
to impose any personal penalty on the party/firm/company who are beyond the
territorial jurisdiction of India, for any acts done by them beyond the Indian
territory.
29\. As such, even on this ground, the personal penalty imposed on the
appellants would have been set aside.
