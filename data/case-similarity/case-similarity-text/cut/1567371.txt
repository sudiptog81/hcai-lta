to those tenants against whom decree for eviction was made under  s. 13(1)
(f). Would the appeal in such a situation become incompetent in part and
remain competent for the other part ? Therefore, it could not be said that
once a specific remedy under s. 17E is provided for the benefit of tenants
under a decree for eviction on the ground mentioned in  s. 13(1) (f), that is
the only way and no other in which he could get relief. If so, his appeal
would become incompetent. Remedy under s. 17E is an additional remedy. More
particularly it appears for the benefit of those tenants against whom decree
for eviction was made under  s. 13 (1) (f) and appeal by whom was not pending
so that they could protect themselves against eviction by landlords whose
suits had become incompetent in view of the provisions contained in sub-s.
(3A) of s. 13.
Accordingly, this appeal is allowed and the decree for eviction made by all
the Courts against the appellant is set aside and the suit is remanded to the
trial court to proceed further from the stage after amendments of pleadings
