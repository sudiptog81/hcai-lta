risk of repetition we would like to state that the assessment order does not
record the satisfaction as warranted by section 271 for initiating the penalty

The above view has been re-affirmed by the jurisdictional High Court in the
case of Super Metal Re Roller P. Ltd. In the present case, no such
satisfaction has been recorded by the AO and the DR also has not been able to

binding decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, it is held that penalty
proceedings were void ab initio. The judgments relied upon by the learned DR
are entirely on different issues and those decisions are not authority on the
issue arising in the present appeal. In the case of Jeevan Lal Sah (supra),
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that after the amendment the decision of
Supreme Court in the case of Anwar Ali, (2002-TAXINDIAONLINE-190-SC-IT) 76 ITR
696 is no longer valid. Similar position was re-affirmed in the other cases
