name 'Kala Niketan' has become distinctive of plaintiff's business and
defendant's use of trading style 'Kala Niketan' was likely or calculated to
deceive orcause.confusion and injury to the business reputation of the
plaintiff. The trade name 'Kala Niketan' was not descriptive of the Sarees in
which the parties were dealing. Defendant was, therefore, not entitled to
trade under the name 'Kala Niketan' and the plaintiff was entitled to relief
of permanent injunction.
(22) The plaintiff has also claimed A decrees for rendition of accounts and an
order for destruction of dies, blocks, labels, etc. There is no evidence that
the defendant had any dies, transfer labels, etc., and therefore no order for
their destruction was required.
(23) Account of profits is an equitable remedy and the Court) has discretion
whether or not to grant it. There is no reasonable prospect that the inquiry
will reach any positive result. In such circumstances I do not think it proper
to grant a decree for accounts. The issues are decided accordingly.
