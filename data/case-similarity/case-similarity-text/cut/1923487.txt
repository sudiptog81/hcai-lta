against the petitioner afforded sufficient grounds for the subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority to excercise his powers under Section
3/1 of the National Security Act.
14\. It is clear from the affidavit of Sri R.S. Agarwal, Deputy Secretary Home
that the petitioner's representation dated 4-7-97 against the impugned order
of detention was received by the state on 10-7-97, 12-7-97 and 13-7-97 were
holidays on account of second Saturday and Sunday. The State Government placed
the said representation along with necessary comments of the detaining
authority before the Advisory Board on 14-7-97, which after the report of the
Advisory Board was again examined by the State Government and was finally
rejected on 17-7-97. The Central Government also rejected the petitioner's
representation which fact was duly conveyed to the petitioner vide FAX message
D/- 28-8-97. It would thus be seen that there was no undue delay in the
consideration and disposal of the petitioner's representation on the part of
the State Government or the Central Government.
