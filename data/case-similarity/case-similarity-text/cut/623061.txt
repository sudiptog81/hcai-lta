affidavit or other evidence. If a party thinks that the happenings in court
have been wrongly recorded in a judgment, it is incumbent upon the party,

That is the only way to have the record corrected. If no such step is taken,
the matter must necessarily end there. Of course a party may resile and an
Appellate Court may permit him in rare and appropriate cases to resile from a
