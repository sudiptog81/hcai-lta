Civil Procedure.
16\. The very basis for the GHMC to issue the impugned notice in W.P.No.22184
of 2009 is the order under review. Since this Court is of the considered view
that the order under review is liable to be reviewed, the impugned notice in
W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is of no consequence and becomes inoperative. In view of
these orders, this Court is of the view that no orders need be passed in
W.P.M.P.No.3495 of 2013 in W.P.No.22184 of 2009\. In view of the principles
laid down in the above referred judgments, the contention of the learned
senior counsel that the present review is not maintainable in view of the
dismissal of the review filed by the official respondents is not at all
sustainable and tenable and this Court cannot remain as a silent spectator for
the contingencies of this nature.
17\. For the aforesaid reasons and having regard to the principles laid down
by the Honble Supreme Court in the judgments referred to above, the review
petition is allowed and the order passed in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated
