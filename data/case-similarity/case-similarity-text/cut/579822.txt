facie case' to go to the trial was made out or not whereas the learned
Magistrate will have to dispose of the case solely on the basis of the
evidence to be adduced during the trial. Since both the offences under
Sections 354 and 509 IPC are tribal in accordance with Chapter XX of the
Criminal Procedure Code we direct the learned Magistrate to dispose of the
case, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of six months
from the date of communication of this order. In view of our above directions
and the provisions of Section 210 (2) Cr.P.C. the complaint case instituted by
Mr. Bajaj for the self same offences loses its independent existence thereby
rendering the other appeal which arose out of that case, redundant, though we
are of the opinion, prima facie, that the claim of privilege, on the basis of
the affidavit of the Chief Secretary, was not sustainable.
In the result the appeal No. 1183/95 arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.2358 of 1989
filed by Mr. and Mrs. Bajaj is allowed and the other appeal No.1184/95 arising
out of SLP (Crl.) No.1361 of 1989 is dismissed as infructuous.
