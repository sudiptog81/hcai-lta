of this Court in Ramachandra Rao v. Narayanarao (1948) 2 M.L.J. 109 : 61 L.W.
508 : A.I.R. 1949 Mad. 156. wherein it was held that the Court did not
understand the decision in Mahadeva Royal v. Chikka Royal (1942) 1 M.L.J. 309
: A.I.R. 1942 Mad. 368. to lay down that, whenever a question as to the
adminissibility of any document was raised in an appeal and that question was
decided in one way, it followed ipso facto that there was a substantial
question of law which would justify the grant of a certificate under Section
110, C.P.C. The Full Bench held that when a question of law was fairly
arguable and when there was room for difference of opinion on it, then such a
question would be a substantial question of law.
7\. Applying this test, the question involved in this case cannot be said to
be fairly arguable. In this view, we are unable to accept the contention of
the learned Counsel that a substantial question of law is involved. The
petitioner in not entitled to certificate also on the ground that the question
involved has been decided by the Federal Court in Subramaniam v. Muthuswami 53
