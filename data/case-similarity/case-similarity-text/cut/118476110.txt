accepted. Even otherwise, since the assessee's grounds are allowed, and as it
was held that jurisdiction in assuming jurisdiction under S.153C is bad in
law, there is no merit in the grounds of the Revenue in the cross-appeal. The
same are accordingly rejected. Appeal of the Revenue, being ITA
No.1175/Hyd/2012 is dismissed.
36\. To sum up, appeal of the assessee's appeal being ITA No.1181/Hyd/2012 is
partly allowed, Revenue's appeal being ITA No.1175/Hyd/2012 is dismissed.
