with respect to the transaction involved in the present appeal is concerned
and after enactment of Section 80HHF, of course Sub-section (5) thereof will
take care to prevent double benefit being claimed by the assessee
69\. In the above view of the matter and following the well recognised
principles of interpretation reiterated from time to time and adopting
purposive interpretation keeping in mind the practical commonsense approach
and commercial expediency we have reached to the conclusion that the
transaction involved in this appeal, on the facts and circumstances of the
case, is well within the sweep of Section 80HHC of the Act and all the
authorities below were not justified in denying the deduction to the claim of
the assessee under Section 80HHC in the sum of Rs 84,23,746 in respect of
export of beta-cam tapes as per agreement dt 29th March, 1995 We, thus, hold
that the assessee is entitled to such deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act
and allow the appeal on this count Accordingly, we answer the question in
favour of the assessee and against the Revenue on this count Section 80-O
