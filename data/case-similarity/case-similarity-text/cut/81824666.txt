    legislation. Unfortunately, the High Court has missed this crucial  question
    of limited jurisdiction and has ventured to re-appreciate the  evidence  and
    recorded its own findings on percentage of disability for which  also  there
    is no basis. The whole exercise made by the High Court  is  not  within  the
    competence of the High Court under Section 30 of the Act.
    Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. The impugned  common  judgment  passed
    by the High Court is set aside. The order dated  16.02.2009  of  the  Labour
    Officer cum Workmen’s Compensation Commissioner, Division  No.  II,  Bellary
    in W.C.A. Nos. 229/2008 to 234/2008 is restored.
    There shall be no orders as to costs.
