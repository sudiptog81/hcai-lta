it. It is seen that even in the letter-head, the petitioner has been using
this mark. Therefore, it is not a distinctive mark given by the petitioner to
the three medicines referred to above but it is a mark which is generally
given to all labels. In its letter dated 11.12.1967, the petitioner has
categorically stated that this mark is being used in respect of all the
articles manufactured by it. I cannot, therefore, construe the said mark as a
brand mark given by the petitioner for the medicines manufactured by it. In my
view, therefore, the three pharmaceutical preparations manufactured by the
petitioner, which were earlier permitted to be cleared without payment of duty
by the Central Excise authorities themselves are not excisable under tariff
item 14-E of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Act and Rules. I have
therefore, to accept the contention of the petitioner and hold that it is not
liable to pay excise duty in respect of the three items of pharmaceutical
preparations, which has been manufactured by it and cleared between 19.09.1966
and 9.04.1970.
