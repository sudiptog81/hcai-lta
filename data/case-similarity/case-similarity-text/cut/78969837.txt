similar to the trademark of the plaintiff, they are being used on identical
goods, and these goods are sold through similar trade channels and are
available at the same outlets.
40\. For all these reasons, I am of the opinion that, pending hearing and
final disposal of the present I.A., the plaintiff is entitled to ad interim
relief, in terms of the prayers in the present application.
41\. Accordingly, there shall be an ad interim injunction, restraining the
defendant from using, manufacturing, selling, exporting, importing, offering
for sale, distributing or otherwise dealing in any product, under the impugned
"Chetak" label, or under any trademark or tradename which is deceptively
similar to the "Officers Choice" and "Officers Choice Blue" trademarks,
registered in favour of the plaintiff.
