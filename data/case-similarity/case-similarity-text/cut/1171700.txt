17\. Judgment in terms of award. Where the Court sees no cause to remit the

set aside the award, the Court shall, after the time for making an application
to set aside the award has expired, or such application having been made,
after refusing it, proceed to pronounce judgment according to the award, and
upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow and no appeal shall lie
from such decree except on the ground that it is in excess of, or not
otherwise in accordance with, the award.
