retained by the  85 company. In Amrit Banaspati case (supra) it has been held
that exemption and refund of tax are two different legal and distinct
concepts. The objective of the exemption is to grant incentive to encourage
industrialization. It is to enable the industry to compete in the market. On
the other hand, refund of tax is made only when it has been realized illegally
or contrary to the provisions of law. Tax lawfully levied and realized cannot
be refunded. In view of the settled position of the law, we decline to accept
the suggestion made by Mr. Parshad.
80\. Direction is, therefore, issued that the amount deposited by the company
in the designated account opened and operated pursuant to the order of this
Court dated 18.11.2002 together with accrued interest shall be released to the
appellant State, forthwith.
81\. I.A. No.3 is therefore allowed in the aforesaid terms.
82\. In view of the above, the appeal filed by the State challenging the
judgment and order dated 24.4.2002 is dismissed, however, I.A. No.3 is allowed
