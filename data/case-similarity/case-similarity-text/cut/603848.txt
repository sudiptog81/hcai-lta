Conservatories Custom Built Ltd., reported (1989) R.P.C. 455 where the
plaintiffs' complaint was that the defendants used albums of photographs of
conservatories designed and installed by the plaintiffs to show their
prospective customers, falsely claiming that the photographs show
conservatories of their own design and work. Customers are thereby misled into
believing that the defendants are the company which produced the
conservatories; that their designs are the same as in the album (which they
are not) and that the defendants have a well-established business (which they
have not). The Appeal Court, following the earlier decisions came to the
conclusion that this was the case of reverse passing off. We find some
substance in the submission of the learned counsel that the action of the
defendants may also amount to an act of reverse passing off. However, having
held in favour of the plaintiffs on the issues of confidentiality and
copyright, it is not necessary to express any opinion on this aspect and the
issue of reverse passing off is expressly kept open.
