plane, we have in India a society based on the principle of graded inequality,
which means elevation for some and degradation for others. On the economic
plane, we have a society in which there are some who have immense wealth as
against many who live in abject poverty.
On 26th January, 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In
politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have
inequality. In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one man, one
vote and one vote, one value, In our social and economic life we shall, by
reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of
one man, one value. How long shall we continue to life this life of
contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and
economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by
putting our political democracy in peril. We must remove this contradiction at
the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will
blow up the structure of political democracy which we have so laboriously
