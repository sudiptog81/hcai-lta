But clearly an ordinance has this force and effect only over an area where it
can validity operate. An invalid ordinance can have no force or effect and if
it is not 'law' in the sense the word has been used in article 21, article 367
(2) cannot make it so.
There is also another aspect of the matter. Article 21 not only speaks of a
situation in normal times which left no time for the to think of a situation
in normal times which left no time for the President to summon Parliament and
required him to promulgate ordinances to take away the life or liberty of
persons, unless one considered life and liberty as matters of no great
importance. However, in view of the opinion of the majority upholding the
validity of the ordinance, it is unnecessary to dilate on this aspect.
On all the other points I agree with conclusions reached by the learned Chief
Justice.
