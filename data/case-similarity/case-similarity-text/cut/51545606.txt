Delhi. We cannot order transfer of suit in these proceedings. In case parties
so desire, they are free to file appropriate application but the suit is
required to be presented in the court of competent jurisdiction only
thereafter the question of transfer would be germane.
47\. In our opinion, the provisions of section 62 of the Copyright Act and
section 134 of the Trade Marks Act have to be interpreted in the purposive
manner. No doubt about it that a suit can be filed by the plaintiff at a place
where he is residing or carrying on business or personally works for gain. He
need not travel to file a suit to a place where defendant is residing or cause
of action wholly or in part arises. However, if the plaintiff is residing or
carrying on business etc. at a place where cause of action, wholly or in part,
has also arisen, he has to file a suit at that place, as discussed above.
Thus, for the aforesaid reasons mentioned by us in the judgment, we are not
inclined to interfere with the orders passed by the High Court. Appeals are
hereby dismissed. No costs.
