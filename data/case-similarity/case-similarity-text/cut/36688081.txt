10.2 We find that, with respect to, denial of Cenvat credit, the department
case is, that the appellant had taken Cenvat credit on the invoices which are
addressed to a separate unit, working at the same premises, and Cenvat credit
in respect of non-registered branches. We find that name of the appellant i.e.
from „NIS Sparta‟ to "NIS Sparta (Division of Mudra Communications Pvt. Ltd.)‟
had been changed in accordance with High Court (permission) order. Moreover,
the department is not disputing that the services mentioned in the invoices
has been used by the appellant. It is settled law that substantive benefit
cannot be denied merely on the procedural lapse. Therefore, we held the ld.
Commissioner has wrongly denied the Cenvat credit to the appellant.
11\. In view of the above, appeal is allowed with consequential relief to the
appellant. The penalties also stand set aside.
