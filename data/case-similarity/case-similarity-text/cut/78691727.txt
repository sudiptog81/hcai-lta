submissions. We find that this is quite contrary to the mandate of section
144C of the IT Act.
5.2 In our considered opinion, circumstances do not warrant any change in the
mark up. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Assessing Officer and
decide the issue in favour of the assessee.
6\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on 21/01/2011 as above.
