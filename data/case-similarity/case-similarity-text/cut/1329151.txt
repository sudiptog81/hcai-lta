39\. The High Court failed to take all aforesaid factors into consideration
before passing impugned judgment and order.
40\. In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that judgment and
order of the High Court impugned herein, is not sustainable in the eyes of
law. The appeals are allowed. The judgment of the High Court dated 26.4.2007
is set aside and the judgments and orders dated 6.7.2006 and 11.7.2006 passed
by the Special Court are restored. No costs.
