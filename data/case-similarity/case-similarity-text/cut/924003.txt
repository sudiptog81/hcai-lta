not a copy of the advertisement of the appellant, therefore, the provisions of
Section 14 of the Act are not applicable to the facts of this case.
35\. We were shown the commercial of roller coaster during the proceedings by
both parties. By seeing the same an impression which one gathers is that
roller coaster of the respondent is a copy of the theme of the roller coaster
of the appellant. The roller coaster commercial of the appellant is an
original work of the appellant, therefore, covered under Section 14 of the
Act. Not only the presence of roller coaster is replica of the appellant's
commercial but even the dress of the boys is also similar. Relying on the
observation of Apex Court in the case of R.G. Anand v. Delux Films, it can
prima facie be concluded that the roller coaster commercial of the respondent
is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyright work of the appellant with
some variations here and there. Having said so we would be failing in our duty
by not restraining the respondents from showing its roller coaster commercial
in the present form.
