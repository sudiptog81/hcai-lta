(A) for the year pertaining to the assessment year 2012-13. Therefore, we hold
that the order of the learned CIT (A) has reached its finality for the
assessment year 2012-13.
48.1 Similarly, we also note that the assessee has furnished the necessary
details of the capital work in progress and the amount of interest capitalized
therein. But the learned DR before us has not brought any iota of evidence
contrary to the finding of the learned CIT-A. Hence we do not find a reason to
interfere in the order of the learned ITA. Hence the ground of appeal of the
revenue is dismissed.
In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
49\. In the combined result, all the appeals of the Revenue and Assessee are
partly allowed for statistical purposes.
    This Order pronounced in Open Court on                 28/06/2019
