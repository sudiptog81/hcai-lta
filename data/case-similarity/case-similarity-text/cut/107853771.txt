confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' the defendants would continue these
acts of infringement, and divert internet traffic to their websites, causing
considerable commercial loss to the plaintiffs. The balance of convenience too
lies in favour of the plaintiffs for grant of temporary injunction, because,
the defendants have not shown how their use is bona fide, or how they would be
prejudiced. On the other hand, the denial of relief would cause harm and
injury to the plaintiffs.
