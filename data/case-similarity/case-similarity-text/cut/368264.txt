We do not think that there was any fraudulent user by the respondent of his
trade name 'Lakshmandbara'. The name was first used in 1923 in a small way in
Uttar Pradesh. Later it was more extensively used and in the same journals the
two trade marks were publicised. The finding of the Registrar is that the
appellant and its agent were well aware of the advertisements of the
respondent, and the appellant stood by and allowed the respondent to develop
his business till it grew from a small beginning in 1923 to an annual turnover
of Rs. 43,000/- in 1946. These circum- stances establish the plea of
acquiescence and bring the case within sub-s. (2) of s. 10, and in view of the
admission made on behalf of the respondent 'that his goods were sold mainly in
Uttar Pradesh, the Registrar was right in imposing the limitation which he
imposed. For these reasons, we would allow the appeal, set aside the Judgment
