rights. The necessity of maintaining the foreign rights outweighs the
practical difficulties involved in applying the foreign remedy. In India,
although the interest on costs are not available due to exclusion of Section
35(3), the same does not mean that Indian Courts are powerless to execute the
decree for interest on costs. Indian Courts are very much entitled to address
the issue for execution of the interest amount. The right to 8% interest as
per the Judgments Act, 1838 of UK can be recognized and as well as implemented
in India.
Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that the Execution Petition filed
by the Respondents for execution of the order dated 19th October, 2006 passed
by the English Court is maintainable under the relevant provisions. Therefore,
we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order. Resultantly,
the appeal is dismissed with costs.
