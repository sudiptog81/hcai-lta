16.3 In the light of the above binding precedent, we are of the view that the
order of the CIT(A) is correct and in accordance with law and he is justified
in directing the AO to exclude the above mentioned expenses both from the
export turnover as well as from the total turnover while  53 IT(TP)A Nos.33 &
115/Bang/2013 calculating deduction u/s 10A of the Act. Accordingly, the
grounds raised on this issue by revenue are dismissed.
17\. In view of the above findings when we have directed the TPO to exclude 12
comparable companies and also to re-examine one of the companies, it is
directed to recompute the ALP after considering the correct operating margin
of the assessee as well as considering the risk adjustment. Needless to say
that the benefit of proviso to Section 92C(2) has to be considered if the
assessee's operating margin is within the tolerance range of mean margin.
18\. In the result, the appeals of the assessee as well as the revenue are
partly allowed.
