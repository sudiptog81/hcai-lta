55\. Civil remedies for infringement of copyright.â€”
(1) Where copyright in any work has been infringed, the owner of the copyright
shall, except as otherwise provided by this Act, be entitled to all such
remedies by way of injunction, damages, accounts and otherwise as are or may
be conferred by law for the infringement of a right: Provided that if the
defendant proves that at the date of the infringement he was not aware and had
no reasonable ground for believing that copyright subsisted in the work, the
plaintiff shall not be entitled to any remedy other than an injunction in
respect of the infringement and a decree for the whole or part of the profits
made by the defendant by the sale of the infringing copies as the court may in
the circumstances deem reasonable.
(2) Where, in the case of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, a
name purporting to be that to the author or the publisher, as the case may be,
appears on copies of the work published, or, in the case of an artistic work,
appeared on the work when it was made, the person whose name so appears or
appeared shall, in any proceeding in respect of infringement of copyright in
such work, be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to be the author or the
publisher of the work, as the case may be.
(3) The costs of all parties in any proceedings in respect of the infringement
of copyright shall be in the discretion of the court.
