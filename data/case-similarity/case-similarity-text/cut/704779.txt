given by the learned Single Judge in support of the impugned judgment are not
sustainable. It is not correct to say that an action of the present type lies
only against the manufacturer of the goods. It can lie against any party
involved in the infringement chain. So far as the production of cash memos is
concerned, it is not necessary. One thing which has to be kept in view is that
such calendestine sales are often without cash memo. Secondly, the averment
regarding sale in the plaint is enough at least at the stage when summons to
the defendants are to be issued in the suit. At that stage only the averments
in the plaint are to be seen. The learned Counsel has relied on a judgment of
this Court in Jawahar Engineering Company and Ors. v. Jawahar Engineers Pvt.
Ltd., reported as 1983 PTC 207. Similarly, at this stage it could not have
been said that this Court does not have territorial jurisdiction to try the
suit. The averments in the plaint are sufficient for present purposes. The
aspect of territorial jurisdiction can be, if at all considered at a later
stage it may require evidence to be led to determine territorial jurisdiction.
