determining the arm's length price, the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to
interfere with the said order under Section 263 of the Act and moreover on the
day the reference was made by the Assessing Authority, there was no return
pending for consideration and therefore, the Tribunal has set aside the order
of the Commissioner. It is against the said order, the revenue is before this
Court.
4\. From the aforesaid facts, it is clear that on the day the reference was
made by the Assessing Authority to the Transfer Pricing Authority, there was
no return pending for consideration by him and therefore, the very reference
was bad. Even  6 otherwise, the said Transfer Pricing Authority did not find
fault with the adjudication of determining arms length price by the Assessing
Authority. In those circumstances, the Commissioner committed an error in
exercising his power under Section 263 of the Act and the Tribunal was
justified in interfering with the said order. Therefore, we do not see any
merit in appeal No. 842/2008. Accordingly, it is dismissed.
