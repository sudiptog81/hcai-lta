respondents. Despite opportunity the applicant has failed to file written
submission.
7\. Having considered the matter in entirety and having delved into the
circulars extracted supra, we are of the considered opinion that the applicant
has been rightly given promotion to Botanist after the period of punishment

shall be accorded as per his due turn and as per law. No order as to costs.
