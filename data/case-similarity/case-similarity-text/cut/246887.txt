dominate the will of Ebad Sheikh and that the execution of the Hiba-bil-Ewaz
was not induced by undue influence.
We have discussed the evidence of the important witnesses in some detail to
show that on the material on record, the finding of the first appellate court
to the effect, that the plainiff had failed to prove that defendant 1 was in a
position to dominate his will, was not wrong or unreasonable. In any case, it
did not suffer from any "illegality, omission, error or defect such as is
referred to in sub-section (1) of section 100". It was a finding of fact and
the High Court in second appeal, had no jurisdiction to interfere with the
same, even if it appeared to be erroneous to the High Court, the error not
being of a kind indicated in section 100(1).
Since the plaintiff had failed to substantiate the first element essential to
the proof of undue influence, the High Court was wrong in holding that the
burden had shifted on the defendant to show that the Hiba-bil-Ewaz was not
induced by undue influence.
