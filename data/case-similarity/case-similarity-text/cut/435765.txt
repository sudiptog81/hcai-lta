court, when a court is considered as a place where truth and justice are the
solemn pursuits. If any party attempts to pollute such a place by adopting
recourse to make misrepresentation and is concealing material facts it does so
at its risk and cost. Such party must be ready to take consequences that
follow on account of its own making. At times lenient or liberal or generous
treatment by courts in dealing with such matters are either mistaken or
lightly taken instead of learning proper lesson. Hence there is a compelling
need to take serious view in such matters to ensure expected purity and grace
in the administration of justice.
Before we part with these cases, we must observe that the misrepresentation
made by the appellants in the SLPs supported by an affidavit require serious
action but we refrain from taking any further action in view of the apology
and regret expressed by the appellants during the hearing. But, we administer
a warning to them to be careful in future and not to make any
misrepresentation or false statement before any court and impose cost also.
