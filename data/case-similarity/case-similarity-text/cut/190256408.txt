Conclusion: -
40\. Thus, for the foregoing reasons I am not inclined to grant an injunction
in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. Consequently, the
captioned applications are dismissed.
41\. The defendants will, however, via their respective affidavits, place on
record the details, quantum, and value of drug manufactured and sold as also
indirect and direct taxes paid in that behalf. This information will be placed
on the Court's record every quarter.
41.1 The defendants will also provide details of their assets [encumbered and
unencumbered] which would include their location and current market value. The
information given in the affidavits will be backed by a certificate of a
statutory auditor. The defendants via their affidavits will also undertake to
pay damages as and when called upon to do so by the Court. These affidavits
will be filed within a period of 3 weeks.
