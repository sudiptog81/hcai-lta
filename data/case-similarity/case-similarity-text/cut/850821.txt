construction shall not be given to the said rules and regulations, unless for
compelling reasons. We, therefore, hold that the said conditions regulating
the restrictions on the personal liberty of a detenu arc not privileges
conferred on him, but are the conditions subject to which his liberty can be
restricted. As there is no condition in the Bombay Conditions of Detention
Order, 1951, prohibiting a detenu from writing a book or sending it for
publication, the State of Maharashtra infringed the personal liberty of the
first respondent in derogation of the law whereunder he is detained. The
appellant, therefore, acted contrary to law in refusing to send the manuscript
book of the detenu out of the jail to his wife for eventual publication.
In the view we have taken, another argument advanced by Mr. Garg, namely, that
the restriction can only be imposed by an order made under s. 30 (f) or (h) of
the Rules and that too in strict compliance with s. 44 of the Act need not be
considered. That question may arise if and when an appropriate condition is
imposed restricting the liberty of a detenu in the matter of sending his books
