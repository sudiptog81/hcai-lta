As far as interim relief is concerned, the decision in the case of Midas
Hygiene Industries (P) Limited and another v. Sudhir Bhatia and others (Supra)
would be applicable in the present case.
22\. In this view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the present appeal
is meritless and the impugned order dated 31.8.2016 passed by learned
Additional District Judge, Patan below application Exh.6 in Trade Mark Suit
No.1 of 2016 does not call for any interference. Hence, the present appeal is
accordingly dismissed. Civil Application also stands dismissed.
23\. The learned Trial Court is hereby directed to expedite the hearing of the
suit being Trade Mark Suit No.1 of 2016.
