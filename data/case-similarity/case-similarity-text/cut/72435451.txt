details the management, especially when the website of the other schools of
the defendants give full details of the management, in my view CS(OS)1151/2014
Page 38 of 39 the adoption of the defendants of the mark ShreeRam is neither
honest nor bona fide. Defendants cannot be permitted to ride over the
plaintiffs‟ extensive labour, effort and allow to reap what has not been sown
by the defendants.
87\. In my view, prima facie, the plaintiff has been able to establish immense
goodwill and reputation in the name of SHRI RAM, attached to the school of the
plaintiff. The achievement of the plaintiffs‟ school show that their school
stand out in the crowd and not that they are yet another in the crowd.
Accordingly, interim order dated 25.4.2014 stands confirmed.
88\. I.A.7512/2014 filed by plaintiff under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC
stands allowed and I.A.10541/2014 filed by defendants under Order XXXIX Rule 4
CPC stands dismissed.
