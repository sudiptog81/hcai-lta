that fact could not alter the nature or character of the ultimate adminis-
trative act. That administrative act would remain an admin- istrative act and
could not be touched by certiorari. The third head of arguments advanced on
behalf of the respond- ents must, therefore, also fail.
In my judgment the first of the two points raised by the learned Attorney-
General on behalf of the appellant must prevail for reasons stated above. This
is sufficient to dispose of this appeal and the second point, namely, whether
a writ of this nature can lie against the Provincial Govern- ment, does not
arise. In view of the fact that the Govern- ment of India Act, 1935, has been
repealed and the provi- sions of our Constitution on this point are different
from those of the Government of India Act, the question has also become
academic for future purposes and I express no opinion on it.

allowed and the judgments and orders of the Courts below should be set aside
