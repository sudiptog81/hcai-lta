remedies available to them."

Patna High Court in Shriram bearings Ltd. v. E.S.I. Corporation (1977 Lab.
I.C. 1482 (Patna)(D.B.)), and N.P. Singh, J. as he then was, speaking for the
Bench categorically held that even the Courts and Tribunals constituted under
the ESI Act, have inherent power to issue appropriate relief by way of
injunction to the party before it and it can enforce the orders."
