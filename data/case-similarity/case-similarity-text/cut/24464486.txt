the petitioner is the pendency of the proceedings before the appellate
authority pursuant to the order of this Court in  8 NALCO case (supra). Unless
various aspects as highlighted in the case of NALCO (supra) are examined,
claim of the petitioner for refund cannot be considered. Therefore, the Sales
Tax Officer is justified in rejecting the refund applications of the
petitioner vide impugned order dated 28.12.2009. However, in the fact
situation, we direct that the said proceedings be completed by the appellate
authority within a period of three months from today, if not already
completed. On the basis of such adjudication of the appellate authority, the
refund, if any, be granted to the petitioner along with interest as provided
under the statute within a period of one month of such adjudication.
9\. In the result, the writ petition is disposed of with the above
observations/directions.
