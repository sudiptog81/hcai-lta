11\. On the discussions in the foregoing paragraphs we hold that the
petitioners are entitled to exemption from levy of octroi and sales tax to the
extent and in the manner specified in the Industrial Policy Resolution dated
1st April, 1979 of the State Government notwithstanding its subsequent
revision in August, 1980. The State Government would take appropriate steps to
exempt the units of the petitioners from levy of octroi on the plant and
machineries brought for establishment of the units of the petitioners and raw
materials used therein for a period of 5 years from the date of commencement
of commercial production of the respective units, in accordance with the
procedure laid down in the Orissa Municipal Act, 1950. This shall be done
within a period of 3 months hence. The petitioners are also entitled to be
exempted from levy of sales tax in respect of goods described in item 26-A
quoted above used in their flour mills for a period of 5 years from the date
of certification of their units in the manner and to the extent stated in the
