applicability of Order II Rule 2 CPC is to establish the identity of causes of
action in the previous suit and the subsequent suit so as to attract the bar
as held in Deva Ram v. Ishwar Chand (1995) 6 SCC 733 and Gurbux Singh v.
Bhooralal AIR 1964 SC 1810\.
16\. In the instant case it cannot be said that the second suit for partition
was in respect of the same cause of action as that on which the previous suit
was based. In respect of the cause of action of the previous suit plaintiff
was not entitled to more than one relief. Hence, it could not be said that the
plaintiff has omitted to sue for relief for which second suit has been filed.
Suit for partition with respect to joint property is based on continuing cause
of action, as such the suit for partition could not be said to be barred by
Order II Rule 2 CPC. Submission to the contrary is too tenuous to be accepted.
17\. Resultantly, the appeal being devoid of merits, deserves dismissal and
the same is hereby dismissed. Costs of Rs.25,000/- to be paid by appellants to
the Supreme Court Bar Association Welfare Trust within a period of two months
