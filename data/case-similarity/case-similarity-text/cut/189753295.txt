in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra), particularly in
para-104 as detailed hereinabove, it is clear that the ordinance only declares
talaq which is instant and irrevocable to be an offence and this is done in
view of the fact that the Supreme Court goes on to hold that this form of
talaq is manifestly arbitrary as the marital ties can be broken capriciously
and whimsically by a muslim man without any attempt for reconciliation and,
therefore, is violative of the fundamental rights contained in Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. That being so, it is not all forms of talaq which
is made punishable under the ordinance. It is only the form of talaq which
becomes effective instantaneously on its pronouncement and which is
irrevocable which is declared to be an offence.
18\. Taking note of all these factors, we are of the considered view that the
ordinance in question has been brought into force in accordance with the
requirements of law only to make more effective implementation of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India
