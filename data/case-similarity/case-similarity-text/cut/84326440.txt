the levy of service tax and the demand pertaining to the training conducted
outside India to the tune of Rs. 2,90,569/- requires to be set aside, which we
hereby do.  9 7.5 From the above discussions, the impugned order is modified
to the extent of allowing the credit on the impugned input services, setting
aside the demand in respect of Commercial Coaching and Training Services for
the period prior to 18.04.2006 and also setting aside the demand relating to
the Commercial Coaching and Training Services conducted outside India (Rs.
2,90,569/-). The demand in respect of Commercial Coaching and Training
Services conducted in India post 18.04.2006 to the tune of Rs. 6,83,897/- is
upheld along with interest. However, the penalty in respect of the said demand
is set aside for the reason that the appellant has paid up the amount before
issuance of Show Cause Notice and also for the reason that the issue is an
interpretational one.
8\. The appeal is allowed partly in above terms, with consequential reliefs,
if any.
