4\. As regards the credit of service tax paid on auctioneer service, it is the
submission that the demand on CENVAT credit availed on auctioneer service,
export survey and survey of export cargo services used for setting up of
container freight station, were hit by limitation as the appellant had always
indicated in their ST-3 returns, the availment of CENVAT credit and they acted
bonafidely on an understanding that all the services were utilised in
connection with the output services rendered by them which is cargo handling
services, storage and warehousing services. We find merits in the
submissions made by the Learned Counsel. As regards the service tax credit in
respect of the input services used for setting up new container freight
station, we find that the said services resulted in setting up of a container
freight station which was used by the appellant for rendering output services
on which tax is discharged. If that be so, the judgment of the Honble High
Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of Sai Samhita Storages 2011 (23) STR 341
(AP) and the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Navratna SG Highway 2012
