Arbitration Agreement had come to an end because the Arbitral Tribunal was not
constituted within 30 days, to my mind, this is an argument which is
thoroughly misconceived. The petitioner had, as is evident from a narration of
events set out above, taken every possible step for appointment of an
Arbitrator beginning with placing its request with the DIAC qua the same on
06.04.2018, which was a date that fell well before the expiry of 30 days from
the date of execution of the 2018 Arbitration Agreement.
Reliefs 51 Thus, having regard to the foregoing discussion, I am inclined to
grant interim reliefs to the petitioner in terms of prayer clause (a) & (b) as
set out in the instant petition, which would continue to obtain during the
pendency of the arbitration proceedings.
52 Needless to say, nothing stated by me hereinabove will come in the way of
the final adjudication of the disputes pending between the parties.
    OMP (I) (COMM) No.326/2018                                        Pg. 64 of 65
     53    The petition is disposed of, accordingly, in the aforesaid terms.
