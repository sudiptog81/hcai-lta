Corporate of Nagpur v. Ramachandran (supra), the Division Bench judgment of
this Court in Jerome D'silva v. Regional Transport Authority (supra) and other
judgments following this Division Bench Judgment can no longer be good law.
Likewise, the judgments of other High Courts cited and relied on by the
learned counsel for the 1st respondent, taking a view that departmental
proceedings cannot be taken after the criminal case ended in favour of the
delinquent can no longer be construed as good law in view of the said Supreme
Court Judgment.
26\. We have already pointed out that the Labour Court and also the learned
Judge have given concurrent findings that the domestic enquiry was fair and
quite in accordance with the principles of natural justice. In fact, the
Labour Court has not said anything against the findings given by the Enquiry
Officer on merits. In such circumstances, in the light of the judgments of the
Supreme Court referred to above, namely, AIR 1977 S.C. 1513 and , it is not
open to this Court to reappreciate the evidence and substitute its findings.
