whose case the matter has been sent back to the ITO there being no information
about others.
16\. In our opinion, the ITO, TDS, in an order under section 201(1) can set
right items falling for consideration under the head "salary" in case he finds
that the stand of the employer is apparently inconsistent with the provisions
of law.
17\. On the alternative submission, proviso to section 201(1) speaks of
penalty u/s. 221 and sub-section (1A) to section 201 speaks of penal interest
on the shortfall in TDS from the date on which such tax was deductible up to
the date on which it was actually paid. The words used are "shall be liable to
pay". As far as penalty under section 221(1) is concerned, we are not dealing
with the same in the present appeals and the assessee may seek relief in those
proceedings. The interest under section 201(1A) is mandatory in nature and is
attracted as soon as the company is treated as an assessee in default for any
violation of TDS provisions. Interest is charged for keeping back Govt. monies
