expressed by the High Court on this issue, in the absence of any argument or
plea before it. The question whether public interest was involved or not
required a factual adjudication. Since there were no pleadings, the State did
not have an opportunity to indicate its stand. Under the circumstances, we do
not think it appropriate to consider that question for the first time in these
appeals, particularly, when factual adjudication would be necessary.
Coming to the plea relating to repeal of the Notification, it is to be noted
that the Notification dated 1.7.1995 was issued in exercise of powers
conferred under Section 9(1)(a) of the Taxation Act, while the impugned
Notification was issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 9(1)(6)
of the said Act. It is to be noted that originally Notification was issued
under Section 3 of the said Act and its operation has not been questioned.
That being the position, there was no requirement to issue a fresh
Notification to make the levy. Notification dated 1.7.1995, did not supersede
the original Notification issued under Section 3 of the Taxation Act.
