Section 20 in the Copyright Act, 1957
20\. Transmission of copyright in manuscript by testamentary
disposition.—Where under a bequest a person is entitled to the manuscript of a
literary, dramatic or musical work, or to an artistic work, and the work was
not published before the death of the testator, the bequest shall, unless the
contrary intention is indicated in the testator’s will or any codicil thereto,
be construed as including the copyright in the work in so far as the testator
was the owner of the copyright immediately before his death. Explanation.—In
this section, the expression “manuscript” means the original document
embodying the work, whether written by hand or not.
