24-12-2016 13:21:26 ::: CWP No.5213 of 2015 - 43 - reasonable period of not
less than two years and re-schedule the payment of instalments as a last ditch
effort for the survival of its project. Such a decision shall be taken by the
State Government within two months from the date of receipt of certified copy
of this order and till then no adverse or coercive action of whatsoever nature
shall be taken against the petitioner. (50) The petitioner has also laid
challenge to the acquisition of a small part of its land, by way of a
miscellaneous application in the second case. Since such acquisition is a
subsequent event, we do not express any views on its merits and dispose of the
petitioner's application with liberty to initiate appropriate separate
proceedings in that regard, if so advised. (51) The writ petition stands
disposed of in above terms.
