be taken. Action under sub-section (8) has to be taken even if failure to pay
advance tax is due to accident or miscalculation or can be justified on any
other group. It follows that when advice tax is not paid, then the assessee is
liable both under sub-section (8) and sub-section (9), subject to certain
conditions. There is, however, nothing unreasonable in this situation. If the
tax is not paid because of miscalculation, etc., then a lighter penalty of
charge of interest is imposed but if it is not paid without reasonable cause,
then heavier penalty is imposed. It is always open to the Legislature to
impose heavier penalty for a default which has been committed deliberately. It
was suggested that it is not possible to compute tax in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (6) when no tax is paid and, therefore, sub-section
(8) does not apply to a case of non-payment of tax. There is no substance in
this argument. If no advance tax is paid at all, then it necessarily falls
short by 80 per cent. and interest is payable on the entire amount of tax in
accordance with the provisions of sub-section (6).
