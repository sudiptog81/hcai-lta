Tax Returns were rejected by the Department on merger of the transferor and
transferee Company. The Supreme Court relied upon its observations in Marshall
Sons and Company (India) Ltd. vs. ITO (1997) 2 SCC 302 to observe that
pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation, the assessment of the
transferee Company must take into account the income of both the transferor
and transferee Companies. It was observed that filing of revised returns by
the transferee Company was not because of any omission or wrong statement
contained in the original returns but because delay occurred on account of
time taken to obtain sanction of the Scheme of Amalgamation. In the present
case the predecessor Company/transferor Company have been succeeded by the
Revisionist/transferee Company who had taken over its business along with
assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc. The stock transferred as a result
of amalgamation was not a sale requiring issuance of certificate by M/s.
Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. in favour of the Revisionist as per the Exemption
Notification of 2016.
