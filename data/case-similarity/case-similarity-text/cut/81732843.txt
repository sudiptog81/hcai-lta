against the drawer of the cheque. Once the accused is not drawer of the cheque
nor signatory of the cheque, no liability whatsoever u/s.138 of N.I. Act lies
on the accused. It is not a case where the cheque is issued by a company or a
partnership firm in which case, the directors or partners could have been
liable, had it been proved that they were incharge of and responsible for the
business of the company. It is a case where an individual had issued a cheque
in individual capacity. The drawer of the cheque is not the accused but his
wife, and the legal notice was never sent to the drawer i.e. wife of accused.
Therefore, the present complaint is not maintainable at all. The complaint is
liable to be dismissed. The complaint is accordingly dismissed and accused is
acquitted of the charges. Surety bond and personal bond stands cancelled.
Surety is discharged. Endorsement, if any on the documents of surety be
cancelled. File be consigned to Record Room.
