of one cause of action and not the other. Recourse to the additional forum,
however, in a given case, may be taken if both the causes of action arise
within the jurisdiction of the court which otherwise had the necessary
jurisdiction to decide all the issues.
In this case we have not examined the question as to whether if a cause of
action arises under the 1957 Act and the violation of the provisions of the
Trade Marks Act is only incidental, a composite suit will lie or not, as such
a question does not arise in this case.
In Patel Field Marsahal (supra), however, we may notice that a subsequent
development has taken place, namely, after the remand, a learned Single Judge
of the Delhi High Court is said to have granted an order of injunction in
favour of the plaintiff-respondent and the matter is pending before the
Division Bench. As we have not expressed our views on the merit of the matter,
it is needless to mention that the Division Bench shall proceed to determine
the questions raised before it on their own merits.
