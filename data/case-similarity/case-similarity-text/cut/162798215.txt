Judgment of A.No.340 of 2019 & 354 of 2010 ORDER In light of the above, we are
of the considered view that the issues raised in Appeal No.340 of 2019 are
devoid of merits and hence, the Appeal is rejected. The Appeal No.354 of 2019
is allowed on all the issues except on the issue of carrying cost.
The impugned order dated 06.09.2019 passed by the Maharashtra Electricity
Regulatory Commission in Case No. 68 of 2012 is upheld on the issues of de-
allocation of coal blocks as Change in Law & Carrying Cost and is set aside on
the issues allowed in Appeal No.354 of 2019, as per our above findings in Para
Nos. 14.1 to 14.7.
In view of the disposal of the Batch of Appeals, the relief sought in the IA
No.1749 of 2019 in Appeal No. 340 of 2019 does not survive for consideration
and accordingly, stands disposed of.
No order as to costs.
Pronounced in the Virtual Court on this 05th day of October, 2020.
