34\. In my view the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of long
continuous user of the trade dress/packaging which is the subject matter of
the present Suit. The nature and extent of the user by the defendant of the
Packaging/Trade Dress which is subject matter of this suit is not clear.
Balance of convenience would hence be in favour of the plaintiff and against
the defendant. The plaintiffs are likely to suffer an irreparable loss and
injury in case, ex parte injunction granted by this Court is not continued.
35\. In view of the above, the present application IA No.5961/2012 is allowed
and the defendant is restrained from selling or dealing with tea products in
packaging using the brand name „BAGAN Fresh‟ which is identical or deceptively
similar to the plaintiff‟s packaging as depicted by the plaintiff in the
documents filed alongwith the plaint and as elaborated in paragraph 5 above
till pendency of the accompanying suit.
