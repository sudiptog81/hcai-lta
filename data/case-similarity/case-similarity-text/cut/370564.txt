acts done or purporting to be done under powers conferred by the statute. The
period of limitation prescribed in the section does not apply to the kind of
suits which were filed by Basappa."
It must be noted that in his suit Basappa contended that the whole assessment
of sales-tax made against him was invalid as it included certain items of
taxes which were not at all taxable by the State and were thus illegal. Thus,
by the above observations the Supreme Court held that Section 18 of the Madras
General Sales Tax Act was not applicable to a suit for refund of a tax, the
imposition of which was wholly ultra vires the powers of the Madras State. In
effect, Section 48 of the Act of 1922 and Section 319 of the Act of 1961 are
not different from Section 18 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. In
view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Basappa's Case AIR 1964 SC 1873
(supra) the petitioner's contention that the non-applicants' suits were barred
by time under Section 48 of the Act of 1922 and Section 319 of the Act of 1961
must be rejected.
