textbooks, by the defendants is thus different; additionally, in their books,
missing in the plaintiff's works are the steps or process of problem solving.
Thus, the defendants' works can be said to be ‗transformative', amounting to
―review‖ under Section 52 (1) (a) (ii) of the Act. Here, the term ―review‖ has
to be interpreted in the context. The plaintiffs claim to copyright is
premised the work being a ―literary‖ one. The review - or commentary, of a
part of such mathematical work - too would have to be seen in the background
of this claim.
38\. ―Review‖ according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Fifth edition) means
―view, inspect or examine a second time or again..‖ In the context of a
mathematical work a review could involve re-examination or a treatise on the
subject. In that sense, the defendants' revisiting the questions, and
assisting the students to solve then, by providing the ―step by step‖
reasoning prima facie amounts to a review, thus falling within the ―fair
dealing‖ provision of Section 52 (1) (a) (ii) of the Act.
