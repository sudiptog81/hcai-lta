notwithstanding that the 1996 Act contains no specific words of exclusion, an
examination of the scheme of the Act would suggest that the intention is to
exclude the application of the provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the
Limitation Act. We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed in the
case of Pushpa P. Mulchandani. We may also mention that though the decision in
Popular Construction Company is rendered after the decision in Pushpa P,
Mulchandani's case, the conclusions in Pushpa P. Mulchandani's case are fully
supported by the decision in Popular Construction Company's case. It is
impossible to subscribe to the view taken by the learned single Judge that the
law laid down in Pushpa P. Mulchandani's case is no longer a good law in view
of the decision in the case of Popular Construction Company.
13\. For all these reasons we have come to the conclusion that the provisions
of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 do not govern the filing of petition
under Section 34 of the 1996 Act and in this view, it is unnecessary to deal
with the other contentions raised in the appeal.
