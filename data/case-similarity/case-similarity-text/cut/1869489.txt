be ultra vires nor was the Import Control Policy impeached. A policy statement
was held to be not a statutory document. No person can con the basis of a
policy statement claim a right to the grant of an import licence. This Court,
also held that there is no absolute right much less a fundamental right, to
the grant of an import licence.
This Court in Deputy Assistant Iron and Steel Controller v. L, Manickchand,
Proprietor, Katrella Metal Corporation, Madras(4) held that no one has any
vested right to an import licence in terms of the policy in force at the time
of his application. There is no misconstruction of any statutory provision in
the present case. In the present case, it cannot be said that there is no
authority of law to reject an application for import licence.
For these reasons, the petition fails and is dismissed. Parties will pay and
bear their own costs.
V.M.K.
Petition dlsmissed.
