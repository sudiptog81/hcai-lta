creditors. It was in the knowledge of the Revenue that the said creditors were
income-tax assessees. Their index number was in the file of the Revenue. The
Revenue, apart from issuing notices under section 131 at the instance of the
assessee, did not pursue the matter further. The Revenue did not examine the
source of income of the said alleged creditors to find out whether they were
credit-worthy or were such who could advance the alleged loans. There was no
effort made to pursue the so called alleged creditors. In those circumstances,
the assessee could not do any further. In the premises, if the Tribunal came
to the conclusion that the assessee had discharged the burden that lay on him
then it could not be said that such a conclusion was unreasonable or perverse
or based on no evidence. If the conclusion is based on some evidence on which
a conclusion could be arrived at, no question of law as such arises.

It is common ground that the question on the penalty aspect depended on the
quantum aspect.
