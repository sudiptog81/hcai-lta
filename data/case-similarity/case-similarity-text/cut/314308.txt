reiterate what we has stated in the case of "R.K. Arya Vs. DCP, EOW" file No.
CIC/WB/A/2007/1547 in which we have held as follows:
> "A conscious decision of this nature will have to be taken with regard to
> each such official failing which this exemption cannot be claimed in a
> general manner."
A conscious decision of this nature will have to be taken at least by the Head
of Department and not by the official himself. As held by us in the earlier
case cited above the official residential address is an integral part of the
disclosure mandated for every public authority u/s 4 (1) (b) (ix). In view of
this the appeal is allowed. The information asked will be provided to the
appellant Shri Arya by the CPIO within 10 working days of the date of issue of
this decision notice.
Reserved in the hearing, this Decision is announced in open chamber on this
18th day of June, 2009. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the
parties.
