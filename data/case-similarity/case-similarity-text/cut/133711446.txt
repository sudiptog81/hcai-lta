Supreme Court in the case of Morgan Stanley (supra). Thus, we hold that, once
the payment made by the assessee to the Indian entity have been accepted to be
at arm's length price then no further attribution is required to be done.
Accordingly, the addition made on account of attribution of profit is directed
to be deleted.
12\. In view of the aforesaid findings, the issue of PE has become purely
academic.
13\. Admittedly, similar facts are permeating in Assessment Year 2004-05 also,
therefore, our finding given above will apply mutatis mutandis for Assessment
Year 2004-05 also. Accordingly, the appeal of the assessee is treated as
allowed.
I.T.A. No.3410 & 3411/DEL/2010 19
14\. In the result, both the appeals of the assessee are allowed.
Order pronounced in the open Court on 20th August, 2018.
