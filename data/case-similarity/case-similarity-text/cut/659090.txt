so, the other consideration mentioned by Mr. Jethmalani would be no answer to
maintaining the acquittal of the respondent. It may be rather unfortunate but
the law must take its course and the accused himself is to be blamed for
having committed such a daring offence and with such dexterity that even an
experienced Judge of the High Court could not see through the skilful game of
the accused.
In view of the seriousness of the offence and the blatant manner in which it
was committed we find it difficult to make a substantial reduction in the
sentence and we are afraid, having found the respondent guilty of the offences
charged against him, it is not 645 possible for us to show any leniency.
However, in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and having regard
to the fact that the respondent would have to lose his service we would
sentence him to six months' rigorous imprisonment. The result is that the
appeal is allowed and the respondent is convicted under s.161, I.P.C. and s.5
(1) (a) and 5 (2) of the Act and sentenced to six months R.I. under each count
