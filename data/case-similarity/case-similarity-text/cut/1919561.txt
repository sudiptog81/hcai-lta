Considering the above observations of this Court in the aforesaid cases we
hold that the principle of res judicata or for that the principles of
constructive res judicata apply to arbitration proceedings and as such the
award made in the second arbitration proceeding being Arbitration Case No. 276
of 1980 cannot be sustained and is therefore, set aside. The High Court has
rightly allowed the F.M.A. No.304 of 1982 holding that the appellant-
contractor was precluded from seeking-the second reference. No other points
have raised before us by the appellant.
