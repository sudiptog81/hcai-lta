Arun Jaitely learned senior counsel for the respondent who took pains to bring
out the distinctive features in the two labels, as our cognitive faculties did
not leave us confused persons, rendering us vulnerable to be deceived as
claimed by the appellant.
24\. Before concluding we may note that since the question of deception has to
be approached from the point of view of a consumer of average intelligence and
imperfect recollection i.e. an ordinary person, common sense which is nothing

25\. For the reason a Judge may not have experienced the purchase of "Officers
Choice" or "Official Choice" or the purchase of a peg of "OC", we recite the
usual mantra. Nothing stated by us would be construed as an expression on the
merits FAO (OS) No.347/2008 & 365/2008 Page 15 of 16 of the controversy. The
learned Single Judge who would ultimately decide the suit would obviously be
guided by the evidence of those who go to the market or sit in a bar to enjoy
a peg or two in the evening.
