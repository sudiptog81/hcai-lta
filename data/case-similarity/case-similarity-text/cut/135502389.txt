has made the provision for a sum of Rs. 2,61,540/-. The excess provision has
been written back and a sum of rs. 1,05,989/- was offered for tax in the next
year. Thus the exact amount paid without deducting the TDS is Rs. 1,55,551/-.
The assessee has raised the plea before the AO but ld. AO has not assign any
reason for not accepting this plea. If we confirmed the disallowance of the
total amount then amount of Rs.1,05,989/- would suffer tax twice i.e. by way
of disallowance in this year and in the next year when assessee has written
back the provision. Therefore, we direct the AO to exclude this amount from
the disallowance after verification that it was offered for tax in the next
year."
In view of the foregoing discussion and the authorities cited above, we allow
this ground and direct the AO to allow this deduction.
249\. In view of our discussion and our finding given above qua each year, all
the appeals are treated as partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the open Court on 4th October, 2019.
