moment the goods viz., toners, developers, spare parts etc. were put into the
machine. In other words, tangible goods in toners, developers etc. were
transferred as and when they were used by the customer.
18\. Having considered the rival contentions of the parties, I have no
hesitation to hold that there is no transfer of any goods in property whether
as goods or in some other form attracting Explanation 3A under Section 2(xxi)
of the Act. Similarly, Explanation 1A under Section 2(xxv) is also not
attracted. Still further, by virtue of the provisions contained in Section
5C(1)(c)
(iii), the cost of the chemicals used by the petitioner for the ST.REV.NOS.30
& 69/2004 57 purpose of effluent treatment is liable to be deducted, they
being consumables.
The reference is answered accordingly.
