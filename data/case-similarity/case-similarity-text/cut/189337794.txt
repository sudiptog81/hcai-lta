would be to permit Cello to continue in the tort. Cello's products do not
appear to be in the market today. The application for stay is made on the
basis that Cello seeks to "liquidate its existing inventory". That is telling.
If ever there was a case to reject an application for stay, this is it: I do
not see why a stay of this order should serve as an opportunity to Cello to
now flood the market with its rival products in the guise of 'liquidating
inventory'. The application for stay is rejected.
