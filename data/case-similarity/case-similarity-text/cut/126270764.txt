directing all the universities in the State to implement the service
conditions as recommended by the UGC and the Six Member Committee constituted
by the Government by amending necessary statutes, ordinances, rules and
regulations. We are, therefore, of the view that till Statute 4 of the First

proposed by the Board of Management of the University to the APAU Act and take
necessary steps for making suitable amendments, at the earliest.
