nor any occasion for the Railway to divert the goods to a different route and
for taking the same to a different route and for taking the same to Aurangabad
which did not fall on the route to Poona at all. The Courts below, therefore,
rightly found that the Railway was guilty of gross negligence.
The last question submitted by the learned Solicitor General was that the
plaintiff was not entitled to loss of profit or loss of market, because the
plaintiff has not pleaded anywhere that he had obtained any permit for the
goods which, were a controlled commodity and sustained loss of market. It is
true that the plaintiff has not pleaded this fact, but the plaintiff has not
at all prayed for any damages on the ground of loss of market or loss of
profit. The plaintiff has only claimed nominal damages for the loss which
occurred to him because of the amount of money which he had deposited in the
Bank and was locked for more than six months due to the delayed delivery. The
Trial Court has already scaled down the amount from Rs. 2,378-65 to Rs.
1,250/- and we think the Trial Court was fully entitled to do so.
