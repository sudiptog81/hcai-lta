155\. The upshot of the above discussion is as follows:
1\. We reject the contention of the appellant that the High Court should have
acted on the Google LLC conditions and found that the appellant is not the
intermediary. We hold that this is a matter for trial.
2\. We hold that Section 79 of the Act, prior to its substitution, did not
protect an intermediary in regard to the offence under Section 499/500 of the
IPC.
3\. We set aside the findings by the High Court regarding the alleged refusal
of the appellant to respond to the notice to remove. We make it clear,
however, that it is for the Court to decide the matter on the basis of the
materials placed before it, and taking into  147 consideration, the
observations contained in this judgment.
156\. We leave open the contentions of the parties except those which we have
finally pronounced upon. Subject to the above, the Magistrate shall proceed
with the complaint. The appeal stands disposed of as aforesaid.
