46\. In the case on hand, the appellant has not come forward with all the
facts. He has chosen to state facts in the manner suited to him by giving an
impression to the Writ Court that an instrumentality of State (SAIL) has not
followed doctrine of natural justice and fundamental principles of fair
procedure. This is not proper. Hence, on that ground alone, the appellant
cannot claim equitable relief. But we have also considered the merits of the
case and even on merits, we are convinced that no case has been made out by
him to interfere with the action of SAIL, or the order passed by the High
Court.
47\. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal deserves to be dismissed and is
accordingly dismissed with costs.
