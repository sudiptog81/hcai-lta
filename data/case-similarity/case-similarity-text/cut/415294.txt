to be seen in the first instance as to whether the impugned mark of respondent
1 (defendant 1) is identical with the registered trade mark of the appellant
(plaintiff). It can be stated immediately that mere look at the two marks
shows that they are not identical. Therefore, it has next to be seen whether
the mark used by respondent 1 (defendant 1) is deceptively similar to that of
the appellant (plaintiff) in the sense that it is likely to deceive or cause
confusion in relation to cycles. That is to say, it has to be seen whether,
having due regard to relevant circumstances, the mark used by respondent 1
(defendant 1) is similar to the appellant's (plaintiff's) mark as remembered
by presons of average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection. For
that purpose, the distinguishing or essentail features (and not every detail
of the two marks) which a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
memory would retail in his mind after seeing the marks, have to be noticed.
    (35) As stated by the learned District Judge, the mark of appellant (plaintiff).    "CONSISTSof a circular device with a star in the centre and a crown at the top. Within the circle, there is an inner circle and the circumference of the inner circle is connected to the star by a large number of lines. In between the circumference of the inner circle and that of the outer circle, there are written the words "THE Eastern STAR". At the bottom of the circle, there is an are like projection containing the words "ATLAS PRODUCT."  
    (36) The device used by respondent 1 (defendant 1), in the words of the learned District Judge, is oblong and contains the representation of a star in a smaller circle in the middle. Above the small circle is written the word "ROYAL" and below it "STAR". Beneath that are the words "MADE In INDIA".
