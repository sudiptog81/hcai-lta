(3) Every rule made under this section shall be laid, as soon as may be after
it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a
total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two or
more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session immediately

such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of
anything previously done under that rule.
