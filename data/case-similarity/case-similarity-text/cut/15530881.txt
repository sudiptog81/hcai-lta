provisions of Section 3 of the Sports Act and Section 8 of the CTN Act have to
be read in such a manner that the shared live broadcasting signal, which
Prasar Bharati receives from ESPN / STAR, should not be placed in the channels

under Section 8 of the CTN Act. We do not agree with the view taken by the
learned single Judge in PW(C) 7655/2007, which forms the subject matter of LPA
No.1327/2007, that carrying sports in a designated Doordarshan channel is a

we regard it as a matter of policy, such policy cannot override the statutory
provisions contained in Section 3 of the Sports Act in the manner which we
have interpreted. The appeal as well as WP(C) 8458/2007 are allowed to the
extent that the live broadcasting signal shared by ESPN / STAR by virtue of
Section 3 of the Sports Act with Prasar LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 &
