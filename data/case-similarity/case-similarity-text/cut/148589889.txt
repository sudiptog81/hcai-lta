incongruous result of section 31 of the Specific Relief Act being held to be
an in rem provision. When it comes to cancellation of a  42 deed by an
executant to the document, such person can approach the Court under section
31, but when it comes to cancellation of a deed by a non-executant, the non-
executant must approach the Court under section 34 of the Specific Relief Act,
1963. Cancellation of the very same deed, therefore, by a non-executant would
be an action in personam since a suit has to be filed under section 34.
However, cancellation of the same deed by an executant of the deed, being
under section 31, would somehow convert the suit into a suit being in rem. All
these anomalies only highlight the impossibility of holding that an action
instituted under section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is an action in
rem.
26\. Given this finding of law, it is clear that the judgments of the District
Court and the High Court in this case need no interference. This appeal,
therefore, stands dismissed.
