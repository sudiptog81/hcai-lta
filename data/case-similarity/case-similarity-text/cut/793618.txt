published earlier, the ground of defense as mentioned in Section 19 can be
taken by the defendants pursuant to Sub-section (3) of Section 22 of the
Designs Act, 2000, therefore, no injunction can be granted as there is a
serious dispute as to the validity of the design to be tried in the suit.
Before closing the arguments affidavit has been filed by the defendants that
application for cancellation has already been made by the defendants before
the appropriate authority. The applicants are not entitled to the injunction.
I, therefore, vacate the injunction order granted earlier. The order dated
10th July, 2001 stands vacated. The application of the plaintiff is dismissed.
Nothing said earlier would be an expression of opinion on the merit of the
case. However, the defendants are directed to keep an account of the sale of
the impugned product. The defendant shall submit the statement after every six
months in Court. The defendants shall also give an undertaking within six
weeks that they will pay the damages to the plaintiffs if ultimately
plaintiffs succeed in the suit.
