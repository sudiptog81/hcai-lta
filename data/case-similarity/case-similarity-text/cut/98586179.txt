questions in the main examination Law Paper -II  : 55 : to an extent of 25
marks under the head "frame proper and necessary issues with the following
pleadings" as not proper. The grievance of the petitioner is that in the
plaint, the provisions of law is not mentioned. In the plaint it is
specifically stated at the top as "plaint". Even in the absence of mentioning
specific provision, it is specified that it is a plaint. Therefore, the non-
mentioning of provision of law in the plaint has not resulted in any injustice
to the petitioner. Secondly, it is contended that in the cause title to the
plaint and the written statement pin code numbers are not mentioned. Again
this is an untenable ground. Thirdly it is contended that in some places it is
mentioned as defendant and in some other places it is mentioned as defendants.
These minor mistakes has not resulted in injustice to the petitioners. It is
not the case of petitioners they are totally misled by these minor mistakes
and for this reason they scored less marks or that they failed.
