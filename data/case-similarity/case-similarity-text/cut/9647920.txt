only at the appellate stage. In this case, a civil suit was also filed before
the High Court at Delhi and a separate application under section 19 of the Act
of 2000 was filed before the Controller and against the decision of the
Controller a regular appeal was filed before the Delhi High Court in which the
issue of territorial jurisdiction of the High Court of Delhi was cropped up.
The Apex Court has held that only the Calcutta High Court has the jurisdiction
to decide the appeal based on the statutory provision and not on
-20- M.P.No.2156/2020 the basis of dominus litus or situs of the appellate Tribunal or cause of action and accordingly granted liberty to the appellant to file an appeal before the Calcutta High Court. 
18\. In view of the foregoing discussion, learned Commercial Court at Indore
has erred in transferring the civil suit and the pending applications to the
Calcutta High Court . The Commercial Court at Indore itself is competent to
decide the suit by virtue of the Commercial Courts Act 2015, hence the
petition is allowed and the impugned order 23.3.2020 passed by the Commercial
Court (District Court, Indore) is set aside.
No order as to cost.
