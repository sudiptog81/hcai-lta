60\. The question posed for consideration in the reference:
"Whether the Court can go into the question of the validity of the
registration of the plaintiff's trade mark at an interlocutory stage when the
defendant takes up the defence of invalidity of the registration of the
plaintiff's trade mark in an infringement suit?" is answered thus:
In cases where the registration of trade mark is ex facie illegal, fraudulent
or shocks the conscience of the Court, the Court is not powerless to refuse to
grant an injunction, but for establishing these grounds, a very high threshold
of prima facie proof is required.
