Regulations 10(f) and (g) cannot be equated to exemption under section 9 of

Institutes and entries made by Doordarshan were illegal and other film makers
cannot claim similar exemption.

cannot claim a similar exemption by placing reliance on such illegality.
Therefore the challenge to the words "and certified by the Central Board of
Film Certification" in Regulation 10(d) and (e) has no merit. The respondents
have not challenged the validity of Regulation 10(f) and (g) granting
