57\. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be
applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may
be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found
certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an 'Arm's Length
Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be
satisfied and have filed such appeals before Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA
No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India
Pvt. Ltd.,  21/21 this Court. Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction
with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a
sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
58\. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as
to costs."
12\. In the circumstances, having heard the learned Counsel appearing for both
the sides, we are of the considered opinion that no substantial question of
law arises for consideration in the present case.
