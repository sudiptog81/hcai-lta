appellant cannot claim any copyright. By adopting such a course, the appellant
cannot drive the respondents out of the said trade.
46\. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that the ends of
justice would be met, if the Order of the learned Single Judge is modified by
directing, "the respondents/defendants shall be entitled to sell their C.D.
Roms with the text of the judgments of the Supreme Court along with their own
head-notes, editorial notes, if any, which should not in any way be copy of
the head-notes of the appellant / plaintiff. The respondents / defendant shall
also not copy the footnote(s) and editorial comment(s) appearing in the
Journal of the appellant/plaintiff." Before parting with the matters, however,
we may observe that we have considered the questions raised before us only for
a limited purpose viz. as to whether any order of injunction should be granted
or not and, therefore, it would be open to the learned Single Judge trying the
suit to adjudicate upon the respective contentions of the parties as their own
merits.
