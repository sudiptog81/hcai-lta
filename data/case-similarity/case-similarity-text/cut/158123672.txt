2008 (Southern Petro Chemical Industries Corporation Ltd. v. Union of India).
Again, the case turned on its own facts as is explained in para 23 of the said
judgment which reads as under:
> "23. The decision of each of the Petitioners to place orders of LPA 35/2013
> Page 8 of 9 import on 22nd February 1997 is evidenced by the letters of
> intent placed by each of them on their importers, copies of which have been
> placed on record. This Court is satisfied that acting on the above statement
> of the Minister made on the floor of the Parliament, which is not a mere
> announcement but in fact the communication of the decision of the Government
> of India, the Petitioners had placed orders for imports for the entire year
> 1997-98. This has to be taken to be an altering of the position of the
> petitioners relying upon the statement made on behalf of the Respondent in
> Parliament on 21st February 1997."
27\. For the reasons already noticed hereinbefore the said decision is
distinguishable in application of the facts of the present case.
