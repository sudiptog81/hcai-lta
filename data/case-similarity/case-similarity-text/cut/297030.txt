are not medicines and that in common parlance also the chemicals sold by the
assessee are not known as medicines. It must be noted here that the Tribunal
did not have any material before it to take the view that in commercial sense
the items are not medicines or in common parlance also they are not known as
medicines. It may be that the two items dealt with by the assessee may not be
available in ail medical shops as medicines. However, the relevant matter to
be considered is as to whether these two items are understood by those, who
are dealing with them, viz., the trader and the consumer as medicines. No
attempt has been made by any of the authorities to find out as to whether
these two items are understood by those who are dealing with the said items as
a drug or only as a chemical. The Tribunal also did not consider this question
bearing in mind the definition of "drugs" in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
and the fact that the assessee is dealing in the two items under a licence
issued under the said Act. In the above circumstances, we are of the view that
the matter must go back to the Tribunal for consideration of the said question
