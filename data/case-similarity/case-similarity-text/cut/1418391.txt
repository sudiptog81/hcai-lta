in an integrated process for weaving the same into fabrics. Although it has
been alleged that the yarn is obtained at an intermediate stage of an
integrated process of manufacture of fabrics, it appears to be not so. After
the yarn is produced it is sized and, 721 thereafter, subjected to a process
of weaving the same into fabrics. Be that as it may, as we have held that the
commodity which is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated process
of manufacture of another commodity, is liable to the payment of excise duty,
the yarn that is produced by the appellants is also liable to payment of
excise duty. In our view, the High Court by the impugned judgment has rightly
held that the appellants are not liable to pay any excise duty on the yarn
after it is sized for the purpose of weaving the same into fabrics. No
distinction can be made between unsized yarn and sized yarn, for the unsized
yarn when converted into sized yarn does not lose its character as yarn.
For the reason aforesaid, the judgment of the High Court is affirmed and this
appeal is dismissed. There will. however, be no order as to costs.
