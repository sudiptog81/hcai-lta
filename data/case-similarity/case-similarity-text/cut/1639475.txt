was not before us.
RFA No. 440/2009 Page 36 of 37 We hold that the Copyright Board erred in its
order passed on 25 th August, 2009 in relying on the order dated 4 th August,
2009 passed by a Division Bench of this Court for coming to the conclusion
that the annual report of the Respondent and other documents were
―inadmissible‖ in evidence. The admissibility or otherwise of those documents
was not before the Division Bench at all. To this limited extent we set aside
the order of the Copyright Board dated 25 th August, 2009 leaving this issue
to be decided at some appropriate stage, as may be advised.
Since the order of the Division Bench suggests its anxiety to have the
complaint before the Copyright Board expeditiously disposed of, we would
request the Copyright Board to try and quickly dispose it off, keeping in mind
at all times the procedural practice suggested by the Supreme Court in Navjot
Sandhu and the law laid down by us.
57\. The appeal is partly dismissed.
