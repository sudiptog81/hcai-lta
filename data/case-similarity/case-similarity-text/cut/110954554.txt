11\. In the instant case, the department raised no demand of service tax on
the fee shared by the appellant with the learning centers. Only the dispute is
pertaining to accreditation fee while in the case of PTU, entire fee
structure was the subject matter of the tax.
12\. Moreover, the Punjab Technical University case has come after 2013, when
the distance education was brought under regulation of the University Grants
Commission. But during the period under consideration, the distance education
was regulated by the Distance Education Council (DEC), IGNOU, Delhi which is
an independent and distinguishable legal entity. The entire fee structure was
brought to the net of service tax in the above case law (PTU) but it is not
the Revenues case in the present case. When it is so then there is no
justification to bring the accreditation fee to the service tax net. Hence,
we set aside the impugned order.
In the result the appeal is allowed with consequential relief.
