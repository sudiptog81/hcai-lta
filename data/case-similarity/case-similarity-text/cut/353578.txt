"one of the notorious wagon breakers and was engaged in systematic breaking of
railway wagons and committing theft of rice and wheat" from railway wagons.
The grounds on which the order of detention was really made, therefore,
included the ground that the petitioner was a notoricus wagon breaker who was
systematically engaged in breaking railway wagons and committing theft of rice
and wheat. This ground was, however, not communicated to the petitioner and he
was not given an opportunity of making a representation against it. This was
clearly in breach of the requirement of Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the
Act and it also constituted violatton of the Constitutional guarantee embodied
in Article 22, Clause (5) of the Constitution. The order of detention was,
thus, vitiated by a serious infirmity and it must be held to be invalid. We
are supported in this view by two decisions of this Court in Shaik Hanif v.
State of West Bengal W.P. Nos. 1979 of 1973 etc., dec. on February 1, 1974 and
Bhut Nath Made v. State of West Bangal. W.P. No 1456 of 1973, decided on
February 8, 1974.
