10A  49 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 and non-10A units is
also required to be examined and verified.
Therefore the claim of the assessee has to be apportioned between units
eligible under Section 10A and the units which is not eligible for the
deduction under Section 10A and then it has to be allowed against the
respective income of the separate units. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, we set aside this issue to the record of the
Assessing Officer for a limited purpose of verification and examination of the
relevant record regarding apportionment of the amount between the 10A unit and
non-10A unit.
