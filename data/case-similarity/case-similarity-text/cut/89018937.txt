company as comparable when the wage and sale ratio was between 30% to 60%. By
applying this filter, several companies were excluded. This is correct as it
is recorded in para 3.1.2 of the order passed by the TPO. TPO, as noted above,
however had taken three companies, namely, Satyam Computer Service Ltd., L&T
Infotech Ltd. and Infosys Technologies as comparable to work out the mean.
8\. It is a common case that Satyam Computer Services Ltd. should not be taken
into consideration. The tribunal for valid and good reasons has pointed out
that Infosys Technologies Ltd. cannot be taken as a comparable in the present
case. This leaves L&T Infotech Ltd. which gives us the figure of 11.11 %,
which is less than the figure of 17% margin as declared by the respondent-
assessee. This is the finding recorded by the tribunal. The tribunal in the
impugned order has also observed that the assessee had furnished details of
workables in respect of 23 companies and the mean of the comparables worked
out to 10%, as against the margin of 17% shown by the assessee. Details of
these companies are mentioned in para 5 of the impugned order.
