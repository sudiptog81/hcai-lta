Learned counsel for the petitioners prays that petitioners are ready to
deposit their contribution towards GPF in respect of service which they had
rendered with FFDA along with interest and their contribution be deducted from
the arrears of the pensionary benefits, which petitioners become entitled for
under this order.
Learned counsel for the respondents raises no objection to the said prayer and
submits that the petitioner's contribution will be deducted alongwith interest
by the respondents from the arrears of the recalculated pensionary benefits,
for which the petitioners will be found entitled under this order and rest of
the amount will be released in their favour within a period of two months from
the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
Both the writ petitions stand allowed in above terms.
