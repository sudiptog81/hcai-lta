suffer any irreparable loss/injury if the defendant also manufactures the
brushes with similar features as both have a healthy competition in the
market. The defendant would rather suffer irreparably if the plaintiffs
succeed in ousting it from the market on the basis of a registered design
which is already in public domain and was not prima facie registerable even.
24\. In the result, this Court has no hesitation in holding that the
plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie case for the grant of ad
interim injunction on the basis of registered design No. 170554. Their
application is therefore, dismissed with costs of Rs. 25,000/-.
25\. The ex-parte ad interim order is vacated.
26\. Nothing stated herein shall be taken as an expression of opinion on the
merits of the suit pending before this Court.
