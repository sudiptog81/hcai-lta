trade mark is registered. Even if the goods are different so long as the trade
name or brand name of some other Company is used the benefit of the
Notification would not be available. Further, in our view, once a trade name
or brand name is used then mere use of additional words would not enable the
party to claim the benefit of the Notification.
7\. Such a view has been taken by the Tribunal in the case of Festo Controls
(P) Ltd. v. CCE, Bangalore [1994 (72) E.L.T. 919]. We approve that decision.
8\. It is settled law that in order to claim benefit of a Notification a party
must strictly comply with the terms of the Notification. If on wordings of the
Notification the benefit is not available then by stretching the words of the
Notification or by adding words to the Notification benefit cannot be
conferred. The Tribunal has based its decision on a decision delivered by it
in Rukmani Pakkwell Traders v. CCE, Trichy [1999 (109) E.L.T. 204]. We have
already overruled the decision in that case. In this case also we hold the
decision of the Tribunal is unsustainable. It is accordingly set aside.
