list, they had given the technical literature to the Department. The
Department did not raise any objection at that time because the department was
also having the same view. The genesis of the Show Cause Notice itself is on
account of the introduction of the definition of Computer Software in the
Customs Notification. In such circumstances, a charge of mis-declaration by
M/s. ABB has no force.
9\. Summing up, we hold that as far as the Central Excise Notification No.
48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994 is concerned, all Software are eligible for exemption
and one cannot import the definition of Computer Software in the Customs
Notification to deny the benefit of exemption to DCS software. The charge of
mis-declaration also cannot be sustained. As regards non-inclusion of Systems
Engineering charges, there is force in the appellants' contention that such
activity has been undertaken at site in connection with the layout of the DCS
and is in no way connected with the manufacture of the DCS. In view of this,
we allow the party's appeal with consequential relief.
