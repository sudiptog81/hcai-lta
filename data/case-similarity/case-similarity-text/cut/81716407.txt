circumstances, it was submitted that the order is illegal and is an abuse of
the process of law. However, it appears to us that this order under Section
156(3) of Cr.P.C. requiring investigation by the police, cannot be said to
have caused an injury of irreparable nature which, at this stage, requires
quashing of the investigation. We must keep in our mind that the stage of
cognizance would arise only after the investigation report is filed before the
Magistrate. Therefore, in our opinion, at this stage the High Court has
correctly assessed the facts and the law in this situation and held that
filing of the petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India or
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., at this stage are nothing but premature.
Further, in our opinion, the High Court correctly came to the conclusion that
the inherent powers of the Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. should be
sparingly used. In these circumstances, we do not find that there is any flaw
in the impugned order or any illegality has been committed by the High Court
in dismissing the petitions filed by the appellants before the High Court.
