of practice is not an healthy tactics therefore all the Ministries /
Departments were requested to follow the laid down norms without deviation and
that the power rested with the ACC should not be exercised by anyone without
the approval of ACC.
52\. The case of the petitioner was also not sent before the ACC. The
Selection Committee first selected the petitioner thereafter itself rejected
the same.
53\. In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the
Selection Committee was not the competent authority to take such decision
against the petitioner. Consequently, the opinion given by Ms. S. Usha, Vice
Chairman, IPAB vide D.O.Dy. No.9369/2010 and subsequent action taken is set
aside. I hereby direct the concerned Ministry that the case of the petitioner
be put up before the ACC. Thereafter, the said authority shall take decision
on the fate of the petitioner.
54\. In view of the above, instant petition stands disposed of with no W.P (C)
