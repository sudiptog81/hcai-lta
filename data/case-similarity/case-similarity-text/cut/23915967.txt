and finding that the plaintiff had furnished false declaration and both the
suits were based on same cause of action and the case suffered from
suppression of material facts and the plaintiff did not approach the Court
with clean hands. Thus, the said  77 C/SCA/410/2014 CAV JUDGMENT decision also
does not render any assistance to the petitioners in light of the facts of
second suit.
26\. In this view of the matter, the conclusion reached by the learned trial
Court cannot be faulted and the impugned order does not warrant interference.
The petitioner has failed to make out any ground or justification to convince
the Court to set aside the impugned order. Therefore, the petition fails and
deserves to be rejected and is accordingly rejected. Notice is discharged.
