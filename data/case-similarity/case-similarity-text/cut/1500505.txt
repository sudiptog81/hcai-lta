creditor. In so far as the reasons that have been indicated by the learned
Company judge for admitting the petition are concerned, we find these reasons
unsustainable. As already held by us, the petition for winding up order as a
contributory under Section 433(f) read with Section 439(4)(b) of the Companies
Act, 1956 is not maintainable. Until the petition is legally maintainable, the
issue of deadlock in the company pales into insignificance.
55\. We, accordingly, dispose of these appeals by the following order:
(i) The impugned order dated 21st April, 2005 is set aside.
(ii) We hold that the petitioner does not have standing to maintain the
petition for winding up order as a 'contributory' unless it is registered on
the register of the company of members.
(iii) That as to whether the petition for winding up the company on just and
equitable grounds can be maintained by the petitioner as creditor shall be
considered by the learned Company Judge and to that extent company petition is
remitted back. This aspect shall be considered by the learned Company Judge
