the activity of the assesses was within the knowledge of the department. The
view taken by the tribunal in that case was upheld by the Apex Court by
dismissing the appeal filed by the department. Since the Tribunal Order in
Moped India case has been upheld by the Apex Court and the view taken by the
Tribunal in the said case has the approval of the Apex Court, the order of the
Tribunal is as that of an order of the Apex Court and is binding on the lower
court and this position has been properly analysed by my learned brother Shri
A.C.C. Unni in Para 18 of the order and the view expressed by him is concurred
with. In the case of Sarwan Singh Lamba and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.,
AIR 195 (sic) (S.C.) 1729 the Supreme Court held that normally even an obiter
dictum is expected to be obeyed and followed. With this view that question
referred to the Larger Bench is to be answered in the affirmative manner and
accordingly, notice issued beyond the period of six months from the date of
knowledge by the department of suppression fraud etc. will be barred by
limitation under proviso to Section 11A(1) of the Act.
