> plaintiff is in continuous business since 2000. The plaintiff has widely
> advertised its product and the same are widely available. This fact is
> corroborated by the annual turnover of their products given by the
> plaintiff. The conduct of the defendants is also worth taking note of. In
> June 2009, the plaintiff having become aware about the defendants'
> infringing footwear, issued caution notice. Thereafter, the infringing goods
> disappeared from the market. However, after grant of design registration in
> their favour, the defendants' infringing goods flooded the market and the
> same again disappeared after plaintiff filed proceedings for cancellation of
> design registration of the defendants."
