25\. We also find that in the impugned order, by which the petitioner's
pension has been deducted at 10%, and a direction has been made to recover Rs.
86, 40, 000/- from the petitioner, there is no finding of loss caused to the
State Government. The entire calculation is on presumptive basis, without
recording any clear and specific findings of any collusion, fraud or resultant
loss. The observations in the punishment order that the petitioner should have
taken steps to file appeals against the orders passed by the High Court for
payment of salaries rather proves his defence that he had given the subject
approvals in compliance with the orders of the High Court. The detail of the
orders passed by the High Court and the opinion of the counsels appearing for

There was no such material brought on record, nor any such charge was levelled
or proved against the petitioner.
