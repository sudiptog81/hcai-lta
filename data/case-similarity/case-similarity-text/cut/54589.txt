Income-tax Officer, Rampur , the question whether the jurisdictional fact has
been rightly decided or not, is a question that is open for examination by the
High Court in an application or a writ of certiorari. Further more, the Bench
of this Court in Tiruchengode Co-operative Marketing Society Limited v. State
of Tamil Nadu [1978] 41 STC 212 already referred to, has clearly laid down
that such a transaction as is carried on by the petitioner does not render it
a "dealer" within the meaning of the Act. But, the respondent-Deputy
Commercial Tax Officer has totally ignored this position. In East India
Commercial Co. Ltd. v. Collector of Customs, Calcutta , the Supreme Court has
pointed out that law declared by the High Court is binding on the lower courts
and Tribunals within its jurisdiction. The respondents-Deputy Commercial Tax
Officer exercising quasi-judicial functions is bound by the aforesaid decision
of this Court and his failure to follow the same invites the exercise of the
extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court. I therefore uphold the
maintainability of this writ petition.
