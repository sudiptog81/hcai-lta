amended from time to time with reference to change in the Industrial Policy of
the State Govt., described in the Industrial Policy Resolutions. No doubt, oil
mills of more than 10 M.T. were shown in the list of industries eligible to
get exemption of sales tax in the notification dated 16.8.1990, but this
amendment related to the industries which have commenced investment after
1.12.1989 which is effective date of IPR 1989. Admittedly, respondent Unit was
set up prior to 1.12.1989 when the IPR 1986 was operative, the respondent Unit
therefore cannot b treated as new Unit under IPR 1989 and notification dated
16.8.90 granting sales tax exemption to oil mills having output of more than
10 M.T. was not applicable to the respondent Unit which is a Unit under IPR of
1986. Since the respondent Unit was not eligible to get concession in the form
of sales tax exemption under IPR 1986 it was not a continuing Unit of 1986
Policy under Part II of IPR 1989 and further was not a new industry under IPR
1989, as such was not entitled to sales tax exemption under Notification dated
16.8.1990.
