that sincere efforts have been made to join independent witnesses. In the
present case, it is evident that no such sincere efforts have been made,
particularly when we find that shops were open and one or two shopÂ­keepers
could have been persuaded to join the raiding party to witness the recovery
being made from the appellant. In case any of the shopkeepers had declined to
join the raiding party, the police could have later on taken legal action
against such shopkeepers because they could not have escaped the rigours of
law while declining to perform their legal duty to assist the police in
investigation as a citizen, which is an offence under the IPC''.
