goods and services. Any attempt by another person to use the name in business
and trade circles is likely to and in probability will create an impression of
a connection with the plaintiff's group of companies. Such user may also
affect the plaintiff prejudicially in its business and trading activities.
Undoubtedly, the question whether the plaintiffs' claim of 'passing-off
action' against the defendant will be accepted or not has to be decided by the
court after evidence is led in the suit. Even so for the limited purpose of
considering the prayer for interlocutory injunction which is intended for
maintenance of status quo, the trial court rightly held that the plaintiff has
established a prima facie case and irreparable prejudice in its favour which
calls for passing an order of interim injunction restraining the defendant-
company which is yet to commence its business from utilising the name of
'Mahendra' or 'Mahendra & Mahendra' for the purpose of its trade and business.
Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court cannot be faulted for
confirming the order of injunction passed by the learned Single Judge.
