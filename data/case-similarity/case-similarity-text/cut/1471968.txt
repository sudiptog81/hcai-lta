prima facie that his removal was either arbitrary, malafide, capricious or
whimsical, the court will call upon the Union Government to disclose to the
court, the material upon which the President had taken the decision to
withdraw the pleasure. If the Union Government does not disclose any reason,
or if the reasons disclosed are found to be irrelevant, arbitrary, whimsical,
or malafide, the court will interfere. However, the court will not interfere
merely on the ground that a different view is possible or that the material or
reasons are insufficient.
51\. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
