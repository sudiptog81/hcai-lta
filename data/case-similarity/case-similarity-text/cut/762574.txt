with reference to a totally different class of goods and, that too, only on
the happening of an event which is unrelated to the act of purchase. The
"taxable event", if one might use the expres- sion often used in this context,
is the consignment of the manufactured goods and not the purchase. I also
agree with my learned brother that the decision in State of Tamil Nadu v.
Kandaswami, [1975] 36 S.T.C. 191, though rendered in the context of an
analogous provision, does not touch the issue in the present case.
The above distinction becomes significant particularly in the background of
the constitutional amendments referred to in the judgment of my learned
brother. These indicate that there were efforts at sales tax avoidance by
sending goods manufactured in a State out of raw materials purchased inside to
other States by way of consignments rather than by way of sales attracting
tax. This situation lends force to the contention of the assessees that the
States, unable to tax the exodus directly, attempted to do so indirectly by
linking the levy ostensibly to the "purchases" in the State.
