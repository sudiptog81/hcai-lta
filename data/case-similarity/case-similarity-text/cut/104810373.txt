to the learned Attorney General, an adverse inference should be drawn, and
from this alone it should be inferred that a PE of the assessees, therefore,
exists in India. We are afraid that this argument cannot be countenanced at
this stage as it has never been raised before any of the authorities below and
has not been raised before the High Court also. This being the case, we do not
think it necessary to get into this aspect of the matter.

29\. Having held in favour of the assessees that no permanent establishment in
India can possibly be said to exist on the facts of the present case, we do
not deem it necessary to go into the cross-appeals that were filed before the
High Court, which were dismissed by the High Court agreeing with the ITAT that
the calculation of the ITAT would lead to nil taxation. This point would not
arise in view of our decision on the facts of the present case. It is,
therefore, unnecessary to go into this aspect of the matter.
30\. The appeals are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
