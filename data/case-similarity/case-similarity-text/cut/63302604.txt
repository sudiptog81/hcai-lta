contract recordings, either alone or together with any other recordings. The
clauses in the agreements under consideration are different and unlike the
clauses in Shanti Film (supra) all the agreements are for a fixed duration and
having similar clauses with regard to recording from sound tracks of the films
after expiry of the period of the agreement.
Under such circumstances the interim order passed earlier stands modified to
the extent that the defendants cannot use the sound track of the films Awara
Baap, Dhanwan and Babu in any manner whatsoever and this order shall continue
till the disposal of the suit. However, in respect of 8 films forming category
A and category B the order of injunction is vacated. The defendants are using
digital recording of the said songs. The defendants shall render true and
faithful accounts of the revenue earned by exploiting the songs whatsoever in
respect of the said eight films and shall furnish quarterly statement of
accounts to the plaintiff.
