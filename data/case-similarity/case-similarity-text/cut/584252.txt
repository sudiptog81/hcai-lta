A slight modification, however, needs to be made. The plaintiff is not only
entitled to mesne profits at the monthly rate fixed by the Trial Court, but is
also entitled to 534 interest on such profits vide s. 2(12) of the Code of
Civil Procedure. We, therefore, direct that the mesne profits be computed at
the rate of Rs. 140/per mensem from June 1, 1949 till the date on which
possession was delivered to the plaintiff (such period not exceeding three
years from the date of decree) together with interest at the rate of six
percent on the amount accruing due month after month. The decree passed by the
High Court will therefore be modified. It is ordered that the plaintiff is
entitled to retain out of Rs. 25,000/- only Rs. 1,000/received by him as
earnest money, and that he is entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.
140/- per mensem and interest on that sum at the rate of six percent as it
accrues due month after month from June 1, 1949, till the date of delivery of
possession, subject to the restriction prescribed by O,20 r. 12 (i) (c) of the
Code of Civil Procedure. Subject to these s, this appeal will be dismissed. In
