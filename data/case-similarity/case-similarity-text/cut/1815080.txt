prosecution of Jagjit Singh therefore before the Magistrate for the offences
under sections 332 and 353 and sections 147 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code
is not in violation of article 20 (2) or article 21 of the Constitution and
must therefore proceed.
The result therefore is that the Petition No. 170 of 1961 filed by Jagjit
Singh will be allowed only to the extent that the appropriate writ of
prohibition shall issue against the respondent in regard to his prosecution
for having committed a jail offence in resorting to hunger strike, but his
prosecution under sections 332 and 353 and sections 147 and 149 of the Indian
Penal Code will not be affected by this order. The Petitions Nos. 171 of 1951
and 172 of 1951 filed by Vidya Rattan and Parma Nand respectively will be
accepted and the appropriate writs of prohibition shall issue against the
respondent as prayed for therein.
Appeal No. 81 dismissed.
Petitions Nos. 171 and 172 allowed.
