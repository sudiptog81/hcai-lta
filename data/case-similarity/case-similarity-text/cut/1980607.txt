ratio of the judgment is not dependent upon the existence of the actual users'
licences among all the members. The facts of the said case and the case before
us are so similar that we think that the principle laid down therein applies
in full force here. We hold that the assessee-association is not a dealer and
is not, therefore, liable to sales tax.
7\. Another aspect on which the Board did not think it proper to apply the
above decision to the facts here was that the assessee here had furnished C
forms. This Court has ruled in K.P. Sitaram & Co. v. State of Madras [1965] 16
S.T.C. 436, that C forms could be given even in respect of agency
transactions. Therefore, the fact that the assessee gave the C forms would not
stand in the way of its being a mere intermediary or a go-between so as not to
be a dealer.
8\. On the facts here, we are satisfied that the assessee's claim was rightly
accepted by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the order of the Board is
erroneous. The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs. Counsel's fee Rs.
