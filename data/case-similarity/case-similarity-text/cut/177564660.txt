decided as per the procedures. We conclude this issue by holding that there is
nothing wrong we have been able to find that the appointment of respondent
Nos.7 to 11 is wrong.
Issue No.8
31\. Coming to the last issue what weighs, in our consideration, even at the
cost of repetition is that the applicant has all along played it safe. He
accepted the punishment without questioning the same. He chooses to remain
silent till he was promoted and then raked up the issue which he could have
well done earlier. We also found no merit in the argument of double jeopardy
or restoration of two original place of cadre seniority in the arguments of
the applicant. Conversely falls that the seniority assigned to Respondent
Nos.2 to 6 has been done correctly. We also find that the arguments raised in
challenging the appointment of Respondent Nos. 7 to 11 do not hold much water
and fail to sustain by leaving open the question of seniority to be decided as
per rules.
