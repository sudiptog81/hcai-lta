10\. This leaves for consideration the matter on merits. In my view, there is
no reason why the applicants/plaintiffs' application ought not to be granted.
On 31st August, 1997 i.e. within four months of the formation of the
partnership firm. An application for registration thereof was duly made with
the Registrar of firms. The suit was filed on 9th March, 2000. The firm was
registered on 28th April, 2000. The applicants/plaintiffs were not responsible
for the delay. The respondents/defendants cannot be prejudiced in any manner
by the applicants/plaintiffs being permitted to agitate their rights. The
affidavit in reply discloses no reasons why any prejudice would be caused to
the respondents if the application is allowed. That the applicants alleged in
the plaint that the - firm was registered is not relevant in deciding this
application. It is an aspect which will fall for consideration when the
applicants plead grounds for saving the bar of limitation in the fresh suit
which they may file. Suffice it to say that there are several obvious bona-
fide reasons why this erroneous plea was taken.
