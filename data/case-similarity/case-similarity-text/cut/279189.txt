plaintiff has not established prima facie case for grant of interim relief.
The trial Court held that the plaintiff the balance of convenience is not in
favour of the plaintiff. Further the trial Court found that if the injunction
is granted, the defendant will suffer irreparable loss which cannot be
compensated in terms of money.
18\. For the foregoing reasons, I find that the view taken by the trial Court
is just and proper and I do not find any merits in the matter. The appeal is,
therefore, dismissed. No order as to costs. Since the main appeal is disposed
of Civil Application No. 2887/2005 is disposed of. Interim relief stands
vacated.
19\. Looking to the peculiar facts of the case the trial Court is directed to
expedite the hearing of the suit and to dispose of the same within a period of
six months from the date of receipt of writ of this Court. It may not be out
of place to mention that it is desirable to hear all the suits between the
parties which will save judicial time.
