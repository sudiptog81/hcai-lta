case will not be an adequate relief to them.
73\. It was also contended on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiffs are
guilty of acquiescence and laches, and therefore, no relief should be granted
to them. I am unable to agree with the submission of learned Counsel for the
defendants. The plaintiffs moved the instant suit immediately after it had
disinvested its shareholding in the second defendant company in February, 1995
and a notice was given to the second defendant to cease and desist from using
the name Baker in its corporate name. Therefore, the plaintiffs cannot be
accused of acquiescence and laches.
74\. In view of the above survey of facts and law I consider it appropriate to
pass an ad interim mandatory injunction against the second defendant.
Therefore, it is ordered as follows:
75\. The second defendant shall stop using the word BAKER in its corporate
name from the expiry of three months from today. The second defendant shall
approach the Registrar of Companies with an application in accordance with law
