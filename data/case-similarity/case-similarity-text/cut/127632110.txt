decided on 29.10.2020, it will be a matter of trial whether the said
disclosure statement of the co-accused is admissible against the petitioner or
not.
Counsel for the State, on instructions from ASI Balwinder Singh, has not
disputed the factual position but opposed the prayer for bail.
Considering the fact that the petitioner is not involved any other case; he is
the first offender; he was neither named in the secret information nor named
in the FIR, this petition is disposed of and the petitioner is directed to
appear before the Investigating Officer within a period of 10 days from today
and he shall be released on interim bail on his furnishing bail/surety bonds
subject to the conditions envisaged under Section 438(2) Cr.P.C.
Disposed of.
