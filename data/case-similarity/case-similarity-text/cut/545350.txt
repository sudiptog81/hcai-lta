needle hour as fixed by the Copyright Board. The interim order passed earlier
fixing the rate @ Rs. 400/- per needle hour is thus modified. With the above
modifications the ad interim order passed on 28th September, 2001 is confirmed
and would continue till the disposal of the suit.
22\. Since the lone defendant is represented before me I expedite the hearing
of the suit. Written statement be filed within four (4) weeks from date. Cross
order for discovery within four (4) weeks thereafter. Inspection forthwith.
Let the suit appear in the monthly list of August, 2004 for hearing before the
appropriate regular Bench.
23\. I further make it clear that in case the rate fixed by the Copyright
Board is altered by the appellate authority this interim order would also
stand altered and the parties would be bound by the order of the appellate
authority under the Copyright Act, 1957 subject to the result of this suit.
24\. G. A. No. 4314 of 2001 and G. A. No. 2286 of 2003 are disposed of
accordingly.
