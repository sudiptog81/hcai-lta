unreasonable conduct, i.e., where the PIO, without reasonable cause refuses to

incorrect, incomplete or misleading information or destroys the information,
that the personal penalty on the PIO can be imposed. This was certainly not

Appellate Authorities and the CIC. It may even lead to unreasonable and absurd
orders and bring the institutions created by the RTI Act in disrepute.
