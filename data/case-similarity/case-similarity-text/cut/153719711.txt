of the Code. The J.M.F.C. Court, which passes such order of imprisonment, can
as well exercise its jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 389, if
necessary application is moved by the aggrieved party by suspending the
sentence passed by it, so as to accommodate the respondent to prosecute his
statutory appeal.
17\. In the absence of any express or implied provision under the Act and also
in the absence of anything conferring the benefits of Section 389
automatically in respect of any or every order in a proceeding under Section
12 of the Act until the Legislature addresses this issue, the Appellate Court
has no power to stay the operation of the order passed by the  19 Magistrate
with the exception of two situations noticed supra, (1) an order of sentence
of imprisonment in a recovery proceeding under Section 125(3) of the Code. (2)
In a proceedings under Section 31 and 33 of the Act.
18\. The inevitable conclusion is, the interim order passed by the lower
appellate court was without jurisdiction and perse illegal.
