be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all."
(Para 34)
36\. We are of the opinion that if the court is satisfied of non-compliance by
the applicant with the provisions contained in the proviso then on being so
satisfied the court which was persuaded to grant an ex parte ad interim
injunction confiding in the applicant that having been shown indulgence by the
court he would comply with the requirements of the proviso, it would simply
vacate the ex parte order of injunction without expressing any opinion of the
merits of the case leaving it open to the parties to have a hearing on the
grant or otherwise on the order of injunction but bi-part only. The applicant
would be told that by this conduct (mis-conduct to be more appropriate) he has
deprived the opponent of an opportunity of having an early or urgent hearing
on merits and, therefore, the ex parte order of injunction cannot be allowed
to operate any more.
