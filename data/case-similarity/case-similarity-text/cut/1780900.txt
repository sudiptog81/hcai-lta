interpretation which has been placed by the two courts below on the commission
note the word "purchaser" cannot be read in the strict sense in which it was
read in Luxor's case (1), but should be read in the sense in which it is
loosely used in common parlance, and that being so, the decision under appeal
cannot be sus- tained.
Mr. Setalvad cited a number of Indian authorities where the words "buyer" and
"purchaser" had not been given the strict meaning that had been given in
Luxor's case (1). Similarly, the words "lender" and "borrower" had been given
the meaning of "potential lender" and "potential borrower". It is, however,
unnecessary to enter into a discussion of all those cases as it does not in
any way advance the matter beyond what I have already said. It is unnecessary
to go into the third contention of Mr. Setalvad in view of the above decision.
For the reasons given above I agree with the conclusion reached by my brother,
Patanjali Sastri, in the judgment just delivered by him, that the appeal be
allowed with costs throughout.
