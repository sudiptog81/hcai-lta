book , after the number of the cheque in question, were transacted or issued
in favour of other or self by the accused between April, 2007 till September,
2008, the date when allegedly cheque was given to the complainant by the

32\. In such circumstances, the case of complainant is proved beyond
reasonable doubt. Accused is found guilty and convicted for the offence u/s
138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.
