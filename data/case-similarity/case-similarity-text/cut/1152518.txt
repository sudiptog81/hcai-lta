Articles 226/227 and upon the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the
Constitution is part of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution.
While this jurisdiction cannot be ousted, other courts and Tribunals may
perform a supplemental role in discharging the powers conferred by Articles
226/227 and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals created under Article 323A
and Article 323B of the Constitution are possessed of the competence to test
the constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules. All decisions
of these Tribunals will, however, be subject to scrutiny before a Division
Bench of the High Court within whose jurisdiction the concerned Tribunal
falls. The Tribunals will, nevertheless, continue to act like Courts of first
instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have been constituted.
It will not, therefore, be open for litigants to directly approach the High
Courts even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations
(except where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is
challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal. Section
