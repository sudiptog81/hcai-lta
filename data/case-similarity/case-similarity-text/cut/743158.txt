appropriate authority and kept on its file without communicating it to the
officer concerned or otherwise publishing it will take effect as from the date
on which the order is actually written out by the said authority; such an
order can only be effective after it is communicated to the officer concerned
or is otherwise published. When a public officer is removed from service, his
successor would have to take charge of the said office; and except in cases
where the officer concerned has already been suspended, difficulties would
arise if it is held that an officer who is actually working and holding charge
of his office, can be said to be effectively removed from his office by the
mere passing of an order by the appropriate authority. In our opinion,
therefore, the High Court was plainly right in holding that the order of
dismissal passed against the respondent on the 3rd June 1949 could not be said
to have taken effect until the respondent came to know about it on the 28th
May 1951."
