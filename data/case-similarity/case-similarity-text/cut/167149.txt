Metropolitan Area. The first appellate court has rightly analysed the evidence
of PW1 and arrived at a decision that as per his own admission, the enjoyment
of her property was not affected.
47\. Considering the fact that the plaintiff had knocked at the doors of the
court only after the first defendant had put up the entire construction, the
first appellate court made an observation that the plaintiff had kept quiet
without filing a suit in time to prevent the construction on deviation made by
the first defendant. It is a casual observation made by the first appellate
court based on the fact situation of the case. The plaintiff was not non-
suited on that sole account by the first appellate court.
48\. In view of the above facts and circumstances, the court finds that the
first appellate court has rightly analysed the evidence on record and has
returned a finding that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought for
by her. There is no warrant for interference with the well considered judgment
of the first appellate court. Therefore, the appeal fails and it is dismissed.
