seniority-cum-merit. The two are inconsistent with each other. This fulfills
the first condition. So far as the second condition is concerned there is an
express reference in the later general law "in the earlier enact- ment". But
as per the proposition of Mukharji, J., if either of the two conditions are
fulfilled the later law, even though general, would prevail. Surely the
provision of recruitment contemplated in the Special Police Rules is
inconsistent with the latest general provision applicable to all posts in
Karnataka. In the present case the later gener- al law prevails over the
earlier special law because the non-obstante clause specifically mentions its
efficacy inspite of the Special Law. It was for the legislature to choose the
method of indicate its intention. The Courts should not defeat their intention
by overlooking it. The respondent No. 2 has been selected for promotion by
follow- ing the General Rules amending the Special Rules and I find it was
strictly in accordance with law. I am, therefore, of the considered view that
the appeal deserves to be dismissed with parties to bear their own costs.
