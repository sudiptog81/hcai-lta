made by the Assessing Officer and con tinned by learned CIT(A) being 10% of
the total expenditure incurred by the assessee company on foreign travel of
its employees, it is observed that this disallowance was made by the Assessing
Officer mainly for the reason that the required details giving purpose of
visit, countries visited, duration of the foreign visit etc. were not
furnished by the assessee company, before him. The learned CIT(A) also
confirmed the said disallowance observing that in the absence of the said
details furnished by the assessee company before the Assessing Officer, the
possibility of non-business expenditure involved therein could not be ruled
out. Before us the learned counsel for the assessee. however, has filed a
Statement giving details of foreign travels such as name of the employee
undertaking the foreign travel, country visited, duration of visit purpose of
visit etc. Since these details were not filed by the assessee company either
before the Assessing Officer or before the learned CIT(A), we deem it just and
proper to give an opportunity to the Assessing Officer to, verify the same.
