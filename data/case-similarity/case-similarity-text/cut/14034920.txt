goods is deceptively similar to that of the appellant's. The element of
deception has to be a rational test, i.e., impression to be covered from
looking at the mark not only on first impression but also upon closer
scrutiny. The mere comparison of three words American Fox Outfitters does
grant them any protection. He submits that no ground is made out for grant of
any interim protection because loss, if any, can always be repaired upon such
amounts as may be fixed by the Court. He refers to section 29 which lays the
test of association between the conflicting trademarks by the mere use of the
words.
The Court is of the view that while font style and font size of the two marks
may be similar, the overall impression gathered by an ordinary unsuspecting
purchaser has to be seen. The appellant's mark includes the distinctive image
of an eagle above the words 'American Eagle Outfitters' while the respondent's
mark includes the image of a 'fox' above the words 'American Fox Outfitters'.
