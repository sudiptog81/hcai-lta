The State of Madras ([1961] 12 S.T.C. 238), nor can we accept an argument
which seeks to give effect to those decisions in such a way as to involve a
departure from the principles as declared by the Supreme Court.
15\. Our answers, therefore, to the questions referred to us are :
(1) Section 9 of the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969, operates to
render ineffective the order of this court in W.P. Nos. 550 to 554 of 1967 and
to render effective and valid the original assessment orders as if they have
been made under or pursuant to sub-section (1-A) of section 6 of the Central
Sales Tax Act, 1956.
(2) The said section 9 likewise renders ineffective any order made by an
appellate or revisional authority under the Sales Tax Act following the
decision in Yaddalam's case and renders valid and effective the original
assessment orders set aside by such authority for the said reason as if the
same had been made under or pursuant to sub-section (1-A) of section 6 of the
Central Sales Tax Act.
