applications under Section 482 were rightly dismissed since these facts
alleged by the appellants depend on evidence at the trial. It is not possible
to agree since it has throughout been the case of the respondent No.
1-Devkatta that he is claiming copyright only in the title of the synopsis of
his story “Desi Boys” and he has not even seen the film of the appellants nor
does he know the story. The learned counsel for the respondent was however
right in his submissions that it is not necessary to furnish all the
ingredients of the complaint and failing which the complaint is liable to be
dismissed on that ground. It is not necessary to consider the decisions cited
by the respondents on this point.
22\. In the result, both the Criminal Appeals are allowed. The Criminal Case
No. SW/332 of 2011 pending before the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai
is hereby quashed.
