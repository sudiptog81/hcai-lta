the witnesses. It was stated in the application that the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the Informant alleged during the said proceedings that
the Commission had already made up its mind to allow cross-examination of the
witnesses even before the application for the same was filed. The Commission,
vide its order dated 07.03.2017, decided to examine the allegations during the
final hearing in the matter. However, the said application was not pressed or
argued by OP-2 during final hearing and, as such, the Commission does not want
to hold any further inquiry in this regard and the same stands disposed of as
not pressed.
Case No. 61 of 2013 58

accordingly.
