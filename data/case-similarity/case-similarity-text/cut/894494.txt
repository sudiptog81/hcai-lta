a very cryptic manner dealt with the issues. No plausible reason has been
indicated as to why the allegations which are quite serious in nature and the
conclusions in relation thereto recorded by the Commissioner were not to be
maintained. Only an abrupt conclusion was reached that Sri Thakur and Sri
Chaudhuri had absolutely no connection with the acceptance of cheques. There
was not even any reference to the allegations regarding accepted backdating or
acting contrary to specific directions. Sri Sharma was given a clean chit in

be taken. Here again the allegations were not considered in the proper
perspective. The findings regarding deemed removal are really inconsequential

established fraud. Therefore, it is not necessary in the present dispute to go
into the question regarding effect of deemed removal.
