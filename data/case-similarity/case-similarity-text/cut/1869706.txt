placed reliance on two decisions namely one decision of the Honourable Supreme
Court in Devender Kumar Singla v. Baldev Krishan Singla . In that decision,
the Honourable Supreme Court has held that mens rea dishonest intention on the
part of the accused could be proved from the circumstances and there need not
be any direct evidence. That case was decided by the Apex Court after full
fledged trial. The another decision in Meena R. Sampath v. The State reported
in 2005 (5) CTC 533 relied by the learned Counsel for the second respondent-
defacto complainant is relating to mens rea for the offence of cheating cannot
be considered at the initial stage. Those two decisions are not applicable to
the facts of the instant case, in view of the findings of this Court as stated
above.
15\. Therefore, as already stated that there is absolutely no specific
allegations levelled against the petitioner for constituting the offence of
cheating, criminal breach of trust and there is also absolutely no materials
available on record through statements recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.
