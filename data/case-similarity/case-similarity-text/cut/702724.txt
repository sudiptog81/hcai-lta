examined the matter, charge-sheet had not been submitted. It was, therefore,
desired that the Designated Court should reconsider in matter with a view to
finding out whether the evidence collected in the course of investigation
showed his involvement. A perusal of Designated Court's order shows that
though according to it a case was made out by the prosecution against Thapa,
it took the view that there was want of material which could be tendered as
substantive evidence to prove association of Thapa with Tiger Memon and his
associates. And so, it allowed Thapa to continue on bail. On these special
facts, we are not satisfied if a case for cancellation of bail has been made
out, despite our taking the view that charges were rightly framed against him.
The State's appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Conclusion
62\. To conclude, appeals of Abu Asim Azmi and Amjad Aziz Meherbux are allowed
and they stand discharged. Appeals of Raju @ Rajucode Jain and Somnath Thapa
are dismissed. The appeal of State is also dismissed.
