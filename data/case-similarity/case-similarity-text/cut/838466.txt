Stamp Act to contend that the action of appellants was `calculated to deprive
the Government of any duty or penalty', but there is no denial of the fact
that appellants were indeed paying the duties, and by no means `depriving the
government of any duty or penalty'. So, the act of the respondent is nothing
but clear a case of its mala fide intention to harass the appellants herein.
It is wholly immaterial whether appellants are purchasing the insurance stamps
from the State of U.P. or from any other State. In fact, as mentioned earlier,
Rules 115-A of the U.P. Stamp Rules itself declares that `Stamps which are the
property of the central Government'. That being the legal  Page 19 of 20
position, it is legally untenable to contend that the insurance stamps must be
purchased from the State of U. P. only. Further, it must be kept in mind that
Section 69 of the Stamps Act will also have no application as, admittedly, the
appellants are neither the stamp vendors nor doing any unauthorised sale of
the insurance stamps. Keeping this in mind, the High Court ought to have
quashed the criminal proceedings launched against the appellants.
