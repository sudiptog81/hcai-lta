there is a difference between contemporaneous dissemination of match
information in the form of ball-by-ball or minute-by- minute score
updates/match alerts and reporting noteworthy information or news. In light of
the above mentioned observations, I hereby order the following:
> a. A limited interim injunction restraining the defendants from
> disseminating contemporaneous match information in the CS (OS) Nos.
> 2722/2012, 3232/2012 and 2780/2012 Page 38 of 39 form of ball-by-ball or
> minute-by-minute score updates/match alerts for a premium, without obtaining
> a license from the plaintiff.
> b. There shall be no restriction upon the defendants to report „noteworthy
> information‟ or „news‟ from cricket matches (as discussed in paragraph 49),
> as and when they arise, because „stale news is no news‟.
> c. There shall be no requirement for the license if the defendants do it
> gratuitously or after a time lag of 15 minutes.
59.In view of the above, the application of the plaintiff under Order XXXIX
