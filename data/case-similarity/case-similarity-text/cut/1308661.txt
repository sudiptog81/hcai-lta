different concern of reputation it cannot be said that service in the hospital
of the appellant is being passed off as that of the first respondent. This
distinctive fact is sufficient to hold that first respondent is not entitled
to the decree granted by the learned District Judge. When the evidence do not
establish that first respondent has any exclusive A.S. 3/1993 28 right in the
name Santhigiri learned District Judge was not justified in granting a
declaration to that effect. Evidence only establish that first respondent is
having an Ashram by name Santhigiri and is also running Vydhyasala and School
all suffixing the name with Santhigiri before the name of the respective
institution. But that will not give an exclusive right like a trade mark or
trade name to the first respondent. Therefore the decree granted by the
learned District Judge is not sustainable.
Appeal is allowed. The decree and judgment passed in O.S.2/1986 by District
Judge, Thiruvananthapuram is set aside. O.S.2/1986 stands dismissed. No cost.
