because the party makes some allegation.
34\. In the present case, we are of the opinion that the material on record
does not disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation by the CBI.
The mere allegation of the appellant that his son was murdered because he had
discovered some corruption cannot, in our opinion, justify a CBI inquiry,
particularly when inquiries were held by the Army authorities as well as by
the G.R.P. at Mathura, which revealed that it was a case of suicide.
35\. It has been stated in the impugned order of the High Court that the
G.R.P. at Mathura had investigated the matter and gave a detailed report on
29.8.2003. It is not clear whether this report was accepted by the Magistrate
or not. If the report has been accepted by the Magistrate and no
appeal/revision was filed against the order of the learned Magistrate
accepting the police report, then that is the end of the matter. However, if
the Magistrate has not yet passed any order on the police report, he may do so
in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above.
