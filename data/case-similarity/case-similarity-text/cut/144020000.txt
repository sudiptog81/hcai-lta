The trial Court exonerated the defendant No.2 totally from its liability to
take any action for removal of defamatory content, but the appellate Court in
its inconsistent finding at paragraph No.23 concluded that the defendant No.2
also liable and directed to withdraw the messages posted by the defendant
No.1, but strangely the first appellate Court affirmed the finding recorded by
the trial Court regarding appellant/defendant No.2. Therefore, on the face of
the judgment, it is erroneous and inconsistent with one finding to the other,
such judgment cannot be sustained under law, more particularly when it is in
compliance of Order XLI Rule 31 C.P.C. Therefore, it is liable to be set
aside. Accordingly, the substantial question of law is answered in favour of
the appellant/ defendant No.2 and against the plaintiff/respondent No.1
herein.
In the result, the appeal is allowed setting aside the judgment and decree
dated 29.01.2016 passed in A.S.No.50 of 2014 by the I Additional Chief Judge,
City Civil Court, Secunderabad dismissing the suit against the defendant No.2
