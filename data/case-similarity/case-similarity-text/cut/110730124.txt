In fact and in effect such announcement culminated into denial of B-3 licence
to the petitioner by the impugned communication dated 10/7/2015 is a glaring
instance of  30 Writ Petition No.5216/2015 [M/s. Himalayan Ales Pvt. Ltd. vs.
State of M.P. and others] irrationality or perversity of decision, if tested
on the touchstone of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness and, therefore,
cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.
Consequently, in the opinion of this Court, respondent no.2 has abdicated his
authority under Rule 4 of the Rules of 2002 in the matter of grant of B-3
licence to the petitioner and has acted in an arbitrary unreasonable manner
influenced by considerations not perceptible in law while issuing impugned
communication dated 10/7/2015. Accordingly, Annexure P/1 dated 10/7/2015 is
quashed. Petitioner is held entitled for grant of B-3 licence for manufacture
of beer and/or draught beer to be issued under Rule 4 of the Rules of 2002 by
respondent no.2 forthwith.
