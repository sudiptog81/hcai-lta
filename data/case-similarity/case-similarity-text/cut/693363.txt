sale deeds or other arrangement in relation to plots 8 to 12 and the road and
open plot No. 2, by the use of the FSI of the whole land covered by plots 1, 3
to 7 and 8 to 1.2: An order of temporary injunction will issue accordingly, It
will be operative pending the suit. It will however be open to the Builder,
8th defendant or others to come forward for modification of this order subject
to offering adequate safeguard in respect of the interests of the plaintiffs
in the property. If any such application is filed, it will be entered after
the summer vacation.
We had to go into various aspects of title to the property in these
proceedings arising under Order 39 Rule 1 CPC. We had to do so because the
Builder & the Jains insisted upon asserting various contentions in relation to
property rights. But we may add again that this order is confined to these
proceedings only and will not come in the way of the suit being decided on its
own merits unaffected by any observations or prima facie findings in this
order.
