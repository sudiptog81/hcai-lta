No. 60/2/14 Page No.2/3 The State vs Depender Mehta client with the commission
of any of the offences.
4 After hearing both sides and going through the entire material placed before
me, I find myself in concurrence with the observations of the Ld. Trial Court
that merely because the accused/respondent was arrested on the basis of
disclosure of coÂ­accused and there is no document in respect of which any
forgery as alleged by the prosecution has been done by the accused, charge
cannot be framed for any of the offences against the accused. Therefore, I
find no illegality and infirmity in the impugned order warranting any
interference of this court in exercise of its revisional powers and
jurisdiction. Therefore, revision petition is dismissed being devoid of any
merits. 5 TCR be sent back to the concerned court alongwith copy of this
order. 6 Revision file be consigned to record room after due compliance.
