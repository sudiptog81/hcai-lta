59\. As far as ground No.19 is concerned while deciding ground no.17 raised by
the assessee we have also held that the computation of disallowance u/s 14A of
the Act as made by the assessee has to be accepted. Therefore ground no.19
does not require any separate consideration.
60\. In the result the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed and the appeal
by the revenue is dismissed.
