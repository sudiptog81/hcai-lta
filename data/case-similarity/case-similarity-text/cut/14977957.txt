not signed by any person. This is not a relied upon document. It will be
incorrect and wrong to hold that the document relied upon by and supplied to
the petitioner is incomplete. For similar reasons, the document at page 26
which is the back side of the certified copy furnished by the High Court of
Calcutta and contains the dates on which the copy was applied for and
delivered etc. has to be rejected. Clerical and numerical mistakes in Bengali
translation would be also immaterial. Respondents have stated that all copies
of documents supplied were photocopies of originals as received. The originals
available with them cannot be improved. Even otherwise, the documents were
legible. This did not hamper or prejudice the petitioner.
22\. We would like to record that in the present writ petition, a number of
contentions had been raised. However, these were not pressed or argued during
the course of hearing before us on 19 th February, 2015. A comprehensive and
complete hearing was held on 19 th February, 2015 and this was made clear to
the parties on the said date.
