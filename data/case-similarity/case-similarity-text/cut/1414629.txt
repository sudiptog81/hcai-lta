the appellants' case.
In the first place, the Tribunal confused a computer system with a computer;
what was being charged to excise duty was the computer.
Secondly, that a computer and its software are distinct and separate is clear,
both as a matter of commercial parlance as also upon the material on record. A
computer may not be capable of effective functioning unless loaded with
software such as discs, floppies and C.D. rhoms, but that is not to say that
these are part of the computer, their value must form par of the assessable
value of the computer for the purposes of excise duty. To give an example, a
cassette recorder will not function unless a cassette is inserted in it; but
the two are well known and recognised to be different and distinct articles.
The value of the cassette, if sold along with the cassette recorder, cannot be
included in the assessable value of the cassette recorder. Just so, the value
of software, if sold along with the computer, cannot be included in the
assessable value of the computer for the purposes of excise duty.
