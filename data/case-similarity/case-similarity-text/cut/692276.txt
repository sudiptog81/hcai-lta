decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Allampati Subba Reddy v.
Neelapareddi , this Court held that there was no consent of the defendant to
the alteration of the date and therefore in terms of Section 87 of the NI Act
it was a material alteration. In the first place, this was not a case arising
under Section 138 NI Act at all. Moreover, while adverting to Section 87 of
the Act, the Court did not notice that the said Section was subject to
Sections 20, 49, 86 and 125 NI Act. These provisions permit the holder in due
course of a negotiable instrument to fill up the material particulars without
the said instrument being rendered void. Section 87 contemplates an otherwise
complete cheque which when presented for payment would be able to be honoured
except for the material alteration. For instance there is an overwriting or
cutting in the material particulars which has not been initialed by the
drawer, then that would prevent the bank from passing the cheque for
clearance. Therefore, this decision is also not of relevance to the facts on
hand.
