25\. Letting under Section 21 is not hedged with any restriction. Throwing the
whole or part of the premises by landlord for letting out is not linked with
his existing accommodation, its number or sufficiency. The one is not
dependent on the other. Even letting for paying instalment of loan, for
constructing the premises or its re-letting has not been held to be contrary
to Section 21. Validity of permission has to be judged on the date of grant of
application. Availability of premises for indefinite letting cannot be judged
by subsequent events or the failure of the landlord to occupy immediately for
personal, financial, economic or other reasons. Therefore, the authorities
committed manifest of error of law, both in entertaining the application of
the tenant resisting the objection of the landlady by placing the burden on
her erroneously and deciding against her by misapplication of law and
misconstructions of the provisions of Section 21.
