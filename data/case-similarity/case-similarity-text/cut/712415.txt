Tribunal or the cause of action. We are inclined to accept Mr. Dave's
submission that the Delhi High Court had erred in making a comparison between
the provisions of Section 51A of the 1911 Act and Section 19(2) of the 2000
Act, which operate on different planes.
25\. Having regard to the above, we are of the view that the impugned order of
the Delhi High Court cannot be sustained and we, accordingly, set aside the
same and hold that in the instant case it is the Calcutta High Court which
will have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under Section 19 of the 2000
Act. The proceedings before the Delhi High Court are, therefore, quashed. The
Appellant is granted leave to move the Calcutta High Court against the order
of cancellation of its  25 design on the grounds taken in these Appeals, as
well as such other grounds as may be relevant for the purpose of deciding the
question of cancellation of the Appellant's design by the Controller of
Designs, Kolkata, within 30 days from date. If the appeals are filed within
the said period, the delay in taking such proceedings shall be condoned.
