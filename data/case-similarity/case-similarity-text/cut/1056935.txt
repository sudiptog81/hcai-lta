28 damages or extra cost or decision as to who committed breach final and
therefore, inarbitrable; and that as a consequence, the respondents were
entitled to claim the extra cost in completing the work (counter claims 1 and
3) and levy liquidated damages (counter claim No.2) and the arbitration costs
(counter claim No.4). Once it is held that the issues relating to who
committed breach and who was responsible for delay were arbitrable, the
findings of the arbitrator that the contractor was not responsible for the
delay and that the termination of contract is illegal are not open to
challenge. Therefore, the rejection of the counter claims of the respondents
is unexceptionable and the High Court's finding that arbitrator ought not to
have rejected them becomes unsustainable. The award of the Arbitrator
rejecting the counter claims is therefore, upheld. Conclusion
24\. No part of the decision of the High Court is sustainable. The appeal is
therefore allowed, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the
order of the District Court dated 12.12.2003, is restored.
