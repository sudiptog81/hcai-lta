inter-se dispute between its employees. If any such dispute arises, the State
should apply the rules laid down by it fairly. Still if the matter is dragged
to a judicial forum, the State should confine its role to that of an amicus
curiae by assisting the judicial forum to a correct decision. Once a decision
is rendered by a judicial forum, thereafter the State should not further
involve itself in litigation. The matter thereafter should be left to the
parties concerned to agitate further, if they so desire. When a State, after
the judicial forum delivers a judgment, files review petition, appeal etc. it
gives an impression that it is espousing the cause of a particular group of
employees against another group of its own employees, unless of course there
are compelling reasons to resort to such further proceedings. In the instant
case, we feel the respondent has taken more than necessary interest which is
uncalled for. This act of the State has only resulted in waste of time and
money of all concerned.
In the light of the view taken by us, the civil appeals and W.P. (C) No.
