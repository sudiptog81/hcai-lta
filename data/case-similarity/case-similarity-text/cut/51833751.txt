them will, before being sold or offered for sale or distributed by them to the
public in DVD, VCD or any electronic or other format, be first submitted to
the CBFC for certification. It is for the CBFC to decide whether it wants to
increase its machinery to ensure that such certification takes place
expeditiously. It is also meanwhile for the UOI to decide whether a film
containing only religious or devotional material would require to be exempted
from certification under Section 9 of the CG Act and on what terms. As far as
the CBI is concerned it can proceed with the prosecutions already launched in
accordance with law. However, in view of the statement by the learned ASG, the
present judgment will apply prospectively and will not be used by the CBI to
register any fresh cases in respect of the films already produced and offered
for sale or distributed to public by any of the Petitioners. The CBI and the
law enforcement machinery of the GNCTD will be free to proceed against any of
the Petitioners if they act hereafter in contravention of the law.
