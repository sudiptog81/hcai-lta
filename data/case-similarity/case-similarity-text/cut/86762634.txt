Judge shall decide the question of interim relief on merits.
2\. The appellant shall handover the Demand Draft of Rs.160 crores to Mr. R.C.
Mishra, Deputy Official Liquidator, who is present in the Court, today itself.
The Deputy Official Liquidator has accepted it and shall pass the receipt of
the same to the present appellant. The Official Liquidator shall see that the
amount is kept in Fixed Deposit at least for one month so that there is no
loss of interest.
3\. It goes without saying that we have not entered into the merits of the
matter and the deposit of Rs.160 crores with Official Liquidator is without
prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties and we have adopted
this only because of the view expressed by the Apex Court in the case of
Shradhha Aromatics Private Limited (supra).
4\. It goes without saying that once the application is made, it will be open
for the learned Single Judge to decide the same on merits. The status-quo
thereafter will be subject to the order which may be passed by the learned
