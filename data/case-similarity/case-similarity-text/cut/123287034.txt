prosecution on the basis of a private complaint in the absence of a complaint
from the appropriate civil court where the alleged fraudulent receipt was
produced would not be sustainable. In view of the same, the Writ Petition is
liable to be allowed and is accordingly allowed quashing FIR No.29 of 2010
dated 13.04.2010 on the file of the Yellareddy Police Station.
47\. W.P.17623 of 2010 was filed challenging the charge sheet in C.C.No.605 of
2009 on the file of the XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and
Special Court for Trial of Video Piracy Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad, on the
ground that the accused cannot be tried for the offence under the provisions
of Copy Right Act in the absence of registration of Copy Right and in any
event, the accused not being the publisher is not liable. These issues have to
be decided after trial in the case. Prima facie, the absence of particulars on
the video film as mandated under Section 52A itself is an infringement of
copyright as held by the Supreme Court in Nagoti Venkataramanas case (supra)
and hence it cannot be held that the petitioner has not violated the law.
