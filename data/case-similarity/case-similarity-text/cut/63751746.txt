terms of which the service tax demand under reversed charged mechanism for IPR
services received from abroad was confirmed.
2\. Learned Advocate for the respondent argues that the period involved in the
appeal is prior to 18.4.2006 and as per judgement of Bombay High Court in the
case of Indian National Shipowners Association vs. Union of India-2009 (13)
STR 235 (Bom.) it has been held that reversed charge mechanism was not legally
available for collecting service tax prior to 18.4.2006 and the said judgment
has been upheld by the Supreme Court [2010 (17) STR J-57 (SC)]
3\. Learned DR does not counter the argument against the contention of the
learned advocate for the appellant.
4\. We have considered the matter. As has been held in the case of Indian
National Shipowners Association (supra) the reverse charge mechanism became
legally operational only with the insertion of section 66A in the Finance Act,
1994 on 18.4.2006. As the period involved in the case is prior to 18.4.2006,
the appeal is devoid of any merit and is therefore dismissed.
