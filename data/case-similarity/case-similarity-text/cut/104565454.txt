in terms of Clause 15 of the agreement.
10\. Though I do not accept the interpretation of the respondent of the said
Clause 15 of the agreement even if such an interpretation is accepted, it can
easily be seen that there is undisputedly an arbitration agreement which would
be, according to the respondent, resorted to once the attempt to resolve the
disputes by the impartial experienced individual fails. In the present case,
when the parties failed to even agree on who such impartial experienced
individual would be, the first requirement of the arbitration clause must be
seen to have been satisfied. It is not as if only when such individual renders
his judgement that the parties can resort to arbitration. Such interpretation
would be too literal, too rigid and plainly not emerging from the reasonable
and conjoint reading of the arbitration clause.
