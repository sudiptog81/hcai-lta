dated 2nd November, 2017.
12\. In the present case also, as we have already pointed out that the
assessment was framed by the AO on the non-existent amalgamated company, not
on the amalgamating company, therefore, the assessment framed was void ab
initio and the same was rightly quashed by the ld. CIT(A). Since, we have
quashed the assessment framed by the AO therefore no separate finding is being
given on the other issues raised in the Departmental appeal.
13\. In the result, the appeal of the department is dismissed. (Order
