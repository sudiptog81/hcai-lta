the issuance of a Notification granting tax exemption would only constitute a
fortuitous circumstance and by no stretch of imagination can it ever be said
that the commis- sioning of the industry was directly the outcome of the
Government's Notification granting tax exemption. The con- cession offered by
the Government under the first Notifica- tion dated 29.4.70 did not prescribe
any period or time limit, and hence the appellants cannot claim anything more
than the benefit of the Notification for such period the exemption was in
force. Once the Government decided, in exercise of the powers vested in it, to
revoke the original Notification, the benefit of exemption from sales tax en-
joyed by the appellants came to an automatic end. The period of five years
mentioned in the second Notification will have no reference to the appellants'
oil mill commissioned much earlier because the Notification had only
prospective ef- fect. We have, therefore, to affirm the view of the High Court
that the appellants will be entitled to the benefit of tax exemption only for
the limited period during which the concession was offered by the Government.
