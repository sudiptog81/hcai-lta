appellate jurisdiction. An appeal cannot be allowed to be disguised in the
form of a writ."
In view of the law declared by the Apex Court in "Thirumala Tirupati
Devasthanams v. Thallappaka Ananthacharyulu" (referred supra) and in the
circumstances stated above, the Court can exercise such power under Article
226 of the Constitution of India to issue a Writ of Prohibition.
In the present facts of the case, the Tribunal lacks inherent jurisdiction to
pass an order/decree declaring the sale deed dated 24.12.1994 vide document
No.8220 of 1994 is void and consequential relief of cancellation of sale deed.
Therefore, I find that the case on hand falls within the principles laid down
by the Apex Court in the judgments (referred supra) and it can be said that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant any of the reliefs since such power
is vested on the Civil Court. Consequently, the writ petition deserves to be
allowed.
In the result, the writ petition is allowed prohibiting the respondent No.4
