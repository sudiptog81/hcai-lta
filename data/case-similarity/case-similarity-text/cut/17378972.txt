particulars entered therein and shall be admissible in evidence in all Courts
without further proof for production of the originals. If the legislature
intended to make the requirement of registration mandatory, the language of S.

depriving an author of the rights conferred by the aforesaid Act on account of
non-registration of the copyright."
