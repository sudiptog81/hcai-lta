been disclaimed, the only effective part of the registered mark of the
plaintiff is "TEA CITY". The plaintiff/respondent, therefore, prima facie,
cannot claim exclusive right to use the words Super Cup by virtue of any
alleged user. The appellant is marketing its tea as "Girnar Super Cup Tea"
since 1995 and it is in the trade of manufacturing and marketing tea for the
last about twenty years. The appellant has in its application stated that it
has export contracts for export of tea under the trade mark "Girnar Super Cup
Tea" with the device of cup and saucer in the name of its associated concern
Girnar Exports and we feel that in case the impugned order is not stayed not
only that the appellant would suffer monetary loss and loss of foreign
exchange but it may also result in the loss of business, reputation and
goodwill of the appellant which in our view cannot be compensated in terms of
money. The appellant shall in our view suffer substantial loss in case the
impugned order is not stayed.
