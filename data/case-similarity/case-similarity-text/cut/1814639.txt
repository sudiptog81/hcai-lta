court has not committed any error of law in not allowing the plaintiff to
produce additional evidence at this stage. Evidence is still to be led by the
parties. The plaintiff filed a suit on April 3, 1992. As per the order passed
by this court, the trial court was directed to decide the matter on or before
April 18, 1992. Affidavit-in-reply was filed by the defendant on April 13,
1992 and on April 16, 1992, the plaintiff filed affidavit-in-rejoinder.
Thereafter on April 18, 1992, the application was filed for production of
other documents which was rightly rejected by the court.
14\. For all these reasons, in my opinion, it cannot be said that the trial
court has committed any error of law which required interference by this
court. Hence appeal is dismissed.
15\. The learned Counsel for the appellant prays that the appellant wants to
approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and prays that ad- interim
injunction granted by the trial court and continued till today may be extended
for some time so as to enable the appellants to take appropriate proceedings
