for sound or other similarly recorded phenomena. As mentioned in the
Notification dated 16th March, 1995, computer software is covered by Heading
No.85.24. The said notification also covers computer software imported in the
form of printed books, pictures, manuscripts and typed scripts covered by
Chapter 49. Computer software can be brought either on a floppy or magnetic
tape or on a hard disk or in a printed form and hence, what is imported is
software on a container which is a hard disk drive. The value of the
containers (hard disks) approximately in the present case is Rs.60000/- or
