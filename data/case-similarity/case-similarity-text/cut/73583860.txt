30\. In view of what is stated above, the respondent as the contractor had to
bear the service tax under clause 9.3 as the liability in connection with the
discharge of his obligations under the contract. The appellant could not be
faulted for deducting the service tax from the bills of the respondent under
clause 9.3, and there was no reason for the High Court to interfere in the
view taken by the arbitrator which was based, in any case on a possible
interpretation of clause 9.3. The learned single Judge as well as the Division
Bench clearly erred in interfering with the award rendered by the arbitrator.
Both those judgments will, therefore, have to be set-aside.
31\. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgments of the
learned Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench, are hereby set aside.
The award made by the arbitrator is upheld. The parties will bear their own
costs.
