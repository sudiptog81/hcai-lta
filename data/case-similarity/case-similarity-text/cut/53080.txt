fibre board containers for facility of transport and smooth transit of the
cartons before delivery of the same to the whole-sale buyer.
The letter dated 4th May, 1976 addressed by the Under Secretary, Central Board
of Excise and Customs to the Cigarette Manufacturers Association which has
been referred to and considered at length in the judgment of the Learned Chief
Justice, clearly supports, in my opinion, the view I have taken.
For reasons briefly indicated above, I have to record my dissent with the view
expressed by the Learned Chief Justice on this question of secondary packing.
On the other question, namely, the question of promissory estoppel I am in
entire agreement with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice for
reasons recorded by him in his judgment and I have nothing to add.
I accordingly hold that the cost of the further packing of the cartons in
which the packets of cigarettes are packed in the corrugated fibre board
containers cannot be included in the value for the purpose of assessment of
excise duty.
