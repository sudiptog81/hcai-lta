imprisonment or fine or all of them. On the facts and circumstances of this
case in the light of our finding that there was a breach of the undertaking we
think that mere imposition of imprisonment or fine will not meet the ends of
justice. There will have to be an order to purge the contempt by directing the
first respondent-contemnor to deliver vacant possession immediate- ly and
issuing necessary further and consequential direc- tions for enforcing the
same.
In the foregoing circumstances, we find the first re- spondent guilty of
committing contempt by wilful disobedi- ence of the undertaking given by him
in this Court and accordingly we convict him and 569 sentence him to pay a
fine of Rs.500 within the period of four weeks, failing which he shall suffer
simple imprison- ment for one month, and also direct him to deliver vacant
possession of the premises forthwith to the petitioner to the extent possible
by him. We further direct the District Magistrate, Thane, to evict all those
who are in physical possession of the property including the 2nd respondent
