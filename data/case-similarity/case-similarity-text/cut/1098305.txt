by the Tribunal. Therefore, the articles of assorted jams, pickles, squashes,
cooking sauces, chutneys, syrups, synthetic vinegars etc. manufactured and
sold by the respondent company under a brand name "Kalvert" were liable to be
charged for excise duty at the rate prescribed in the Excise Law.

39\. The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent but leaving the parties
to bear their own costs.
