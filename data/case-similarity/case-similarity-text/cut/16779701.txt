creates lot of dust and particles which needs to be cleaning on regular basis
to carry uninterrupted production activity. Similarly, the pest control is
also very much necessary for such pollution prone industries. Therefore,
cleaning activity is directly used in the manufacture of the final product.
4.5 Travel agency service is again used for the employees for performing the
outside duties for the companies. Therefore, it is used for the overall
business of the company not for the individual's personal use.
4.6 Courier service is used for movement of samples, raw materials and mostly
for authorized documents such as orders, quotations, marketing documents,
instruction, cheques, etc. These activities are directly used in or in
relation to manufacture as well as business of the appellant's company.
Revenue could not bring anything on record contrary to the use of services
presented by the appellant. In respect of all the services, there are various
judgments passed by Tribunal and High Courts. Therefore, I am of the view that
all the services are indeed input services and eligible for Cenvat Credit.
