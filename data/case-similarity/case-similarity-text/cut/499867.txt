discretionary powers. If it is right, that the Governor is bound by the
decision of the majority party, the element of discretion of Governor, in the
matter, disappears. In the scheme of Constitutional provisions the Governor is
to act with the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
Minister. He is bound to act accordingly. The other functions which the
Governor performs in which aid and advice of the Council of Ministers is not
necessary, he acts in his own discretion. He is not bound by decision/advice
of any other agency. It is no doubt true that even in the written Constitution
it is not possible to provide each and every detail. Practices and conventions
do develop for certain matters. This is how democracy becomes workable. It is
also true that the choice of the majority party regarding its leader for
appointment as Chief Minister is normally accepted, and rightly. But the
contention that in all eventualities whatsoever the Governor is bound by the
decision of the majority party is not a correct proposition. The Governor
cannot be totally deprived of element of discretion in performance of duties
