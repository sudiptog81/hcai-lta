38\. Since, we have confined our decision to only grounds of appeal no.3.6 to
3.9, therefore, the other grounds which were not argued by the ld. counsel for
the assessee are dismissed as being not pressed.
39\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.
Order pronounced in the open Court on this 02nd February, 2018.
