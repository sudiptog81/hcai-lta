directed to pay compensation to the complainant u/s.357(3) of Cr.PC. The
cheque in question is dated 15.10.2008, which was dishonoured i.e. more than
six months time has been passed from the date of cheque. Besides this, the
complainant must have incurred some expenses in prosecution of this complaint
and it must have also led to unnecessary harassment. Therefore, in my
considered view, convict shall pay a compensation amount of Rs.2,25,000/Â­
u/s.357(3) of Cr.PC within 30 days from the last day of appeal, failing which,
the convict shall be liable for a further imprisonment for a period of three
months S.I. In the case of Hari Singh Vs. Sukhbir Singh, 1988(4)SCC 511 and
also in the case of Suganthi Suresh Kumar Vs. Jagdishan, 2002 Cr.LJ 1003=2002
AIR SC 681, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that In default of compensation,
imprisonment can be ordered.
5\. The earlier personal bond/surety bond of the convict are cancelled. He is
ordered to be taken into custody for serving of the sentence. Copy of the
judgement and sentence be supplied to the convict free of cost immediately.
