itself will not matter but writing 'crocin' or calling the tablet by any other
name or mark by which the medicine gets associated with the manufacturer in
the eyes of the purchaser in the course of trade would make a difference. But,
in this case, no evidence has been led by the Department in support of its
contention that the markings of the type indicated on the cartons or their
labels and in question here indicated a connection in the course of trade
between the medicine and the manufacturer.
9\. Therefore, I am of the view that the Department's case has remained
unsubstantiated. There is no dispute that the names of the medicines have been
indicated by the appellants as Tovidone - Iodine Ointment USP' and 'Povidone -
Iodine Solution USP' and these are mentioned in the United States
Pharmacopoeia which is one of the recognised Pharmacopoeia mentioned in
Chapter Note 2(ii). In the above circumstances, it will only be appropriate to
hold that the Department has not been able to prove that the items in question
were patent or proprietary medicaments although they were allopathic medicines
