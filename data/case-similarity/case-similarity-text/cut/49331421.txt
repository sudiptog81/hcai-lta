difference in functional comparability can be eliminated. By not resorting to
such a process of making adjustment, the Page 36 of 36 36 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
TPO has rendered this company as not qualifying for comparability. We,
therefore, accept the plea of the assessee in this regard."
Concurring with the findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai Bench (supra) and also the
appellant's vehement objection in choosing Celestial Labs Limited as
comparable, we are of the considered view that this issue also requires a
fresh look at the TPO's level. To facilitate the TPO to comply with the
directions of this Bench (supra), we remit back this issue also to the file of
the TPO.
8\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed as
indicated above.
Order pronounced in the open court on 16th day of March, 2012.
