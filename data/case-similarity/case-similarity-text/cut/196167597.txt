from using the name of ICANN. They only represent the appellant. In fact they
are reselling the services of registrar being provided by the appellant. After
selling the services of the registrar they remit the money to the appellant as
per the agreement. We find that the agreement is of a nature of principal to
principal basis and resellers cannot be considered as franchisee or associate
franchisor of ICANN.
43\. In fact, we have already held earlier that appellant cannot be considered
as a franchisee of ICANN and therefore resellers cannot be considered as
franchisee of the associate franchisor. In view of the above position, in our
view the Revenues contention that the resellers are providing the franchisee
services of the ICANN does not hold water. In view of the above analysis we do
not find any strength in the second demand notices also. Accordingly we hold
that no service tax is leviable under the franchise service and hence demand
and penalties are not sustainable.
44\. We also note that the appellant has raised certain other arguments.
