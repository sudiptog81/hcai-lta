has not notified in the Official Gazette the area for grant of reconnaissance
permit or prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, and two or
more persons have applied for a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or
a mining lease in respect of any land in such area, the applicant whose
application was received earlier, shall have the preferential right to be
considered for grant of reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining
lease, as the case may be, over the applicant whose application was received
later: Provided that where an area is available for grant of reconnaissance
permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, and the State
Government has invited applications by notification in the Official Gazette
for grant of such permit, licence or lease, all the applications received
during the period specified in such notification and the applications which
had been received prior to the publication of such notification in respect of
the lands within such area and had not been disposed of, shall be deemed to
have been received on the same day for the purposes of assigning priority
under this sub-section: Provided further that where any such applications are
received on the same day, the State Government, after taking into
consideration the matter specified in sub-section (3), may grant the
reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may
be, to such one of the applicants as it may deem fit.
