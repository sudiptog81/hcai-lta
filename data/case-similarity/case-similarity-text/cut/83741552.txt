    81.     Prima        facie,      the       aforesaid   table   indicates   that        those
characteristics, in respect of which the two varieties were found to have
qualified the DUS test, are more or less identical when compared inter W.P.(C)
6470/2013 & 6208/2014 Page 48 of 49 se. However, this Court is not inclined to
examine the said controversy any further as the same has not been considered
in any of the impugned orders. However, it is obvious that if the question
whether the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 are different and distinct from each
other is required to be determined, a meaningful examination of their
essential characteristics would be relevant.
82\. In view of the above, the impugned orders dated 09.09.2014 and 27.08.2018
are set aside. The impugned letter dated 24.06.2013, to the extent that it
confirms that Kaveri's KMH-50 is eligible for registration under the Act, is
set aside. Pioneer's application for conducting the special test in the nature
of DNA profiling of the variety 30V92 and KMH-50 is restored to the file of
the Registrar for considering it afresh, if necessary.
