court appeal. We are afraid, even that course is now no more open to the
appellant in view of amendment and insertion of Section 100-A in the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908 as inserted by Act 104 of 1976. The said section reads :
"100A. Notwithstanding anything contained in any Letters Patent for any High
Court or in any other instrument having the force of law or in any other law
for the time being in force, where any appeal from an appellate decree or
order is heard and decided by a Single Judge of a High Court, no further
appeal shall lie from the judgment, decision or order of such single Judge in
such appeal or from any decree passed in such appeal."
20\. We may state that constitutional validity of Section 100-A is not
challenged before us. In view of provisions of Section 100A, now, no LPA
against an order passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court would be
competent. There is, therefore, no question of obtaining certificate of
fitness from the learned Single Judge who delivered the judgment impugned in
the present LPA.
