29\. In Entertainment Network (India) Limited, the Supreme Court discussed the
provisions of the CR Act in detail. It has spelt out the scope of the powers
of the copyright societies. It pointed out that the CR Act itself maintained a
balance between the interests of the owner of copyright in protecting his work
on the one hand and the interest of the public in having access to such work
on the other. This Court is not persuaded to hold that the fixation of tariff
or royalties by PPL and IPRSL in exercise of their powers under the CR Act is
per se arbitrary or unreasonable.
30\. Having said that, it must be emphasized that any challenge to an instance
of tariff fixation by PPL or IPRSL can be raised before the CB. In fact, this
has already been done. The case sent on remand to the Copyright Board
following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Entertainment Network (India)
Limited has already been adjudicated by the CB. It is not, therefore, as if
there is no remedy available to the user of the copyright who is aggrieved by
the fixation of tariff by a copyright society.
