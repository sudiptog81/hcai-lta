to this Court by way of civil appeal under section 35-L(b) of the Act.
By judgment delivered by this Court today in the case of Commissioner of
Central Excise, Belgaum v. M/s Akay Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd. [Civil Appeal
Nos.3792-3803 of 2000], this Court has partly allowed the department's appeal.
However, the order of remand on the question of "related person" during the
period 4/91 to 3/93 has been upheld.
In the present appeal, 11 show-cause notices were issued by the department
calling upon the assessee as to why the deduction in respect of the above
seven items should not be disallowed for the period 4/93 to 6/97. Since the
question of "related person" had been remanded to Commissioner (Appeals) by
the tribunal under its earlier order dated 6.1.2000, the dispute on the same
point of "related person" for the period 4/93 to 6/97 was also required to be
remanded to the Commissioner (Appeals). In the circumstances, we do not find
any infirmity in the impugned judgment.
Before concluding, we may point out that in the case of Commissioner of
