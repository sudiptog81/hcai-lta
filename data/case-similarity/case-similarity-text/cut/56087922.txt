Appeal Nos. 77 and 86 of 2009
87\. Therefore, with reference to the issue of the refund of the Deemed
Generation incentive we confirm the order of the State Commission. As such the
contention of the Appellant in regard to this issue would fail. However, as
indicated in earlier paragraphs, we accept the contention of the Appellant
with regard to the first issue and as such the finding given by the State
Commission in regard to the liability to pay the compensation is liable to be
set aside. Accordingly, the same is set aside.
88\. in the result, the Appeal No. 77 of 2009 filed by Gujarat Urgja Vikast
Nigam Ltd. is dismissed and the Appeal No. 86 of 2009 filed by Essar Power
Ltd. is partly allowed. No costs.
