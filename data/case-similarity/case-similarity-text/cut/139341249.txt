drums, therefore, the whole case of the prosecution for offences U/s 78/79 of
The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 stands unproved.
9\. As observed here-in-above that prosecution has failed to examine its
material witnesses despite numerous opportunities being granted to it for
completing its evidence. Eventually they remains only material testimony of
PW-1 on record which is highly insufficient to hold the accused persons guilty
of offences U/s 7 of Essential FIR No. 75/1997 Page 6 to 7  7 Commodities Act,
1955 & U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958
10\. Accordingly, in view of above said discussion, it is held that the
prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the allegations
against the accused persons, therefore, accused Sushil Kumar Gupta & Naresh
Kumar are acquitted in the present case U/s 7 of The Essential Commodities
Act, 1955 & U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. Bail bonds
of both the accused persons are cancelled and their sureties are discharged.
File be consigned to record room.
