State as regards the procedure for levy and collection of the tax as also for
imposition of penalties.
There can be no doubt that Parliament can repeal the provisions of s.8(2)(b)
adopting the higher rate of tax fixed by the appropriate 912 State legislature
in respect of intra-state sales. If Parliament can rePeal the provision, there
can be no objection on the score that Parliament has abdicated its legislative
function. It retains its control over the fixation of the rate intact. In
other words, so long as Parliament can repeal the provisions of s.8 (2) (b)
adopting the higher rate of tax fixed by the State legislatures, it has not
abdicated its legislative function. As already stated, this point has been
expressly decided by the Privy Council in Cobb & Co Ltd. v. Kropp (supra). We
are glad to find that our conclusion that Parliament has not abdicated its
legislative function by enacting S. 8 (2) (b) of the Act is in agreement with
that reached by the High Court of Gujarat in Rallis India Ltd. v. R. S. Joshi
Sales Tax Officer(1) and the High Court of Punjab in Tek Chand Daulat Rai v.
