used by the experts examined in the case) there are strange coincidences,
series of coincident reproductions, and although it cannot be said for certain
that the defendants' work was a mere imitation of the plaintiff's work, as
there were differences and improvements in the later publication, the
impression is left that the defendant in his work has largely copied the
plaintiff's book. Although there may have been some exercise of individual
choice and some judgment also in adding some new features which might be
considered improvements on the plaintiff's books, the defendant's book appears
to me to be a colourable imitation of the plaintiff's Shook a copy which comes
so near to the plaintiff's work to the mind of every person seeing both the
productions. On an examination of Exs. 1, 2 and 3, in the case before us, I am
unable to say that the defendant has merely applied his labour to various
sources of information before him, in the production of his work; and, in my
judgment, the defence of a common source, which was strenuously urged by Dr.
Bijan Kumar Mukherjee on behalf of the appellant is unsustainable.
