(C) AIR 1994 Allahabad 273 Kanoria Chemicals & Industries Ltd. v. U.P. State
Electricity Board.
"After the dismissal of the writ petitions wherein notification dated
21.4.1990 was stayed, the result brought about by the interim orders staying
the notification, became non est in the eye of law and lost all its efficacy
and the notification became effective from the beginning."
8\. In Raghvendra Rao etc. Vs. State of Karnataka and others, JT 2009 (2) SC
520 the Apex Court has observed:
"It is now a well-settled principle of law that merely because an employee had
continued under cover of an order of Court, he would not be entitled to any
right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service. ............."
9\. On the contrary, I find that order passed by Settlement Officer
(Consolidation) declaring the petitioner permanent is patently without
jurisdiction and, the said Officer definitely has committed a serious
misconduct and this matter need be seen in disciplinary side by respondent no.
