whereby the sunset clause was extended by one more  I.T.As. No.1764 &
2276/DEL/2015 61 year, i.e., Assessment Year 2011-12. The impact of said
amendment would be that the unit set up in financial year 2001-02 will get
full tenure of deduction, whereas any STP unit set up later on will get a
limited tenure. Thus, assessee was entitled for deduction u/s.10A (1) wherein
there was no such limit on claim of deduction. It was only in Section 10A (1A)
which is applicable to SEZ, that such limit of time period for claim of
deduction of 100%, 50% and 30% has been laid down. Since here in this case
assessee is having a STP unit and not SEZ therefore, ld. DRP was correct in
holding that provision of Section 10A (1A) will not apply, but Section 10A (1)
only. Accordingly, the direction of the DRP is affirmed and Revenue's appeal
is dismissed.
40\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed and Revenue's appeal
is dismissed.
Order pronounced in the open Court on 22nd April, 2019.
