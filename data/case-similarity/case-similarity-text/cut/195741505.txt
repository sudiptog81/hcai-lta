newspaper report of alleged corruption quoted by the appellant's
representative has nothing to do with the departmental examination held on
29/07/2001 in which no irregularities whatsoever was detected. The appellant
contended that the information is disclosable as per the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the  Page 1 of 3 matter of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India vs. Shaunak H. Satya & others (Civil appeal No. 7571 of
2011) decided on 02/09/2011. Decision Notice:
The Commission in the past has held that the answer sheets of other candidates
are exempt from disclosure to third parties under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI
Act. The allegations of corruption by the appellant's representative are not
supported by any evidence whatsoever and hence we do not see any public
purpose warranting disclosure of information. As regards the Supreme Court
decision quoted by the appellant's representative, its ratio does not apply to
the matter at hand.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
