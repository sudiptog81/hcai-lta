the prosecution against aforesaid accused persons (the appellants herein).
There is no concrete and direct allegation against all these persons ascribing
any definite role to each one of them in the offence alleged. The statements
shown to us as allegations amounting to prima facie evidence against them,
according to us, are very bald and vague statements on the basis of which no
case could be made out.
22.We are of the opinion that such allegations do not make out a case of prima
facie evidence. Consequently, we have no other option but to  Page 18 of 19
quash the proceedings as against the appellants herein i.e. Accused Nos. 2 and
3 and Accused Nos. 6 to 8. While doing so, however, we make it clear that we
express no opinion so far as the allegations made in the said charge sheet
against Accused No. 1 and other accused persons are concerned. We also make it
clear that the observations made herein by us are only with respect to the
criminal proceedings and none of these observations shall be construed as an
opinion of ours so far civil liability, if any, is concerned.
