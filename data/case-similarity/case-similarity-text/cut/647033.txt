other employees of the petitioner. As regards the solicitation already made by
the respondent in the advertisement, the petitioner, if it is able to
substantiate this in the arbitration proceedings, would be entitled to be
compensated by the grant of damages. So, it is not as if a breach of the non-
solicitation clause would leave the petitioner without a remedy. The remedy
lies in the claim for damages and an injunction against solicitation in
future. It does not lie in the grant of an injunction preventing its employees
from resigning and taking up employment with the respondent. Accordingly, this
application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is
disposed of with the following directions:
1) the respondent is restrained during the pendency of the arbitration
proceedings from taking out any other or further advertisements or to do
anything to solicit, induce or encourage the employees of the petitioner to
leave the petitioner's employment and take up employment of the respondent
and/or its agents and/or representatives and/or competitors;
