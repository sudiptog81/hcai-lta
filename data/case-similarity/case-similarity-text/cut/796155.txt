indicate the involvement of the assessee or the two other companies in
arranging for funds to M/s VSIPL (M). The second document also refers to
disbursement of funds by and not to any flow of funds to VSIPL(M). Therefore,
the basic assumption of the Id.DR that there was an out flow of funds from
India from the assessee and the two other companies to VSIPL(M) which was used
for purchasing of shares is found to be not correct. In the circumstances, we
are doubtful as to how the provisions of Section 93 could be invoked by the
Revenue. We do not wish to (SIC) further on this issue for the reason that we
have already held that this new plea should not be permitted to be raised by
the Revenue for the first time before the Tribunal. For the reasons stated
above, we are of the view that the CIT(A) was fully justified in deleting the
addition made by the Assessing Officer and consequently his order is confirmed
and this ground of appeal by the Revenue is dismissed.
183\. The second ground of appeal by the Revenue does not call for any
adjudication as the additions made by the Assessing Officer have been deleted.
