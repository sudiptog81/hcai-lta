31\. In this case, the learned Single Judge has adjudicated and decided
questions of fact and  25 rendered a judgment, without evidence tested by
cross­examination….”
25\. The Division Bench ought to have confined itself to examination of the
validity of the order of injunction granted by the learned Single Judge only.
But we are not inclined to remand the matter for that purpose to the Division
Bench as we are satisfied in the facts and circumstances of the case that the
nature of the injunctive relief granted by the Single Judge was in order and
merits no interference during the pendency of the suit.
26\. The order of the Division Bench is set aside. The order of the Single
Judge dated 28.03.2017 is restored and the suit is remanded to the learned
Single Judge for disposal in accordance with law. In view of the importance of
the question involved, we expect the parties to cooperate and facilitate the
learned Single Judge in early disposal of the suit.
