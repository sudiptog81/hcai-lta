5\. Since the issue as to whether the transfer of technology and know-how by
the Japanese holding company to the assessee fulfils the requirements of
Section 65 (105) (zzr) read with the definition of Intellectual Property
Rights in section 65 (55 a), has not been considered by the adjudicating
authority. we are of the considered view that it is appropriate to remit the
matter for consideration afresh and grant liberty to the assessee to raise any
other issue as well before the adjudicating authority including as to whether
the provisions of Section 65 (105) (zzr) are applicable to the assessees
transactions, since the payment of royalties event though subsequent were
pursuant to an agreement which was earlier to introduction of the taxable
service. The assessee shall file a Memorandum of Written Submissions within 3
weeks from today before the adjudicating authority on this aspect but shall
not however be entitled to personal hearing again. Any case supporting the
assessees contentions may also be appended to the Memorandum of Written
Submissions, within the time stipulated herein.
