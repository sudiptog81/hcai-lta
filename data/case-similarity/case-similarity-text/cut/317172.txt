second contract and therefore the return of the security amount would not be
covered by point 2(a). And, as regards point 2(d), the contention of the,
Board was that it related to the claims of the Board against the respondent in
respect of or under the agreement. The Board, therefore, contended that the
matter was not referred to the arbitrators either under point 2(a) or 2(d).
The High Court did not express any final opinion on this question. No doubt,
the agreement to refer makes it clear that there (1) [1923] A. C.480.
(2) [1967] 1 S.C.R. 3.24 822 were no other questions of dispute or difference
arising for settlement except those which were specifically detailed in the
agreement and it was also stated in the agreement that all other questions and
claims of the respondent were withdrawn and should be deemed to be abandoned.
Whether the return of the security amount would fall under point 2(c) would
depend upon the answer to the question whether it is a claim of the Board. The
question whether the Board can re- tain the amount under the contract is a
claim of the Board failing within point 2(d).
