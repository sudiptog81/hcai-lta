Having given my anxious consideration to the case, I am of the view that it is
not possible to hold that the petitioner can be called an 'anti-social
element' as defined by section 2 (d) of the Act. The order of detention
impugned in this case, therefore, could not have been passed under section 12
(2) of the Act which authorises the detention of anti-social elements only.
Before leaving this case, I should state that a number of decisions were cited
before us in which it had been held that an order of detention based on a
criminal charge which is still to be tried may not be invalid and that an
order granting bail by a criminal court cannot be a bar to the passing of an
order of detention. But I have not found it necessary to deal with them here
as they would have become relevant only if I had been satisfied that the
petitioner was an anti-social element. Moreover the orders of detention
questioned in those cases were governed by the provisions of the statutes
under which they had been issued.
