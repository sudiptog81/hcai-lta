premises fall within the ambit of only one act, as that issue was not before
the Court.
52\. For the reasons stated above, we allow this appeal and set- aside the
impugned judgment and order dated 7.6.2010 rendered by the High Court of
Bombay in Writ Petition No. 2473 of 1996. The said Writ Petition shall stand
allowed, and the judgment and order dated 17.1.1996 passed by the City Civil
Court, Mumbai, as well as the eviction order dated 28.5.1993 passed by the
respondent No. 2 against the appellant will stand set aside. The proceedings
for eviction from premises, and for recovery of rent and damages initiated by
the first respondent against the appellant under the Public Premises Act,
1971, are held to be bad in law, and shall therefore stand dismissed. We
however, make it clear, that in case the respondents intend to take any steps
for that purpose, it will be open to them to resort to the remedy available
under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, provided they make out a case
therefor. The parties will bear their own costs.
