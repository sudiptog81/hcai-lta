political inconveniences and complications which would be result'. We are
inclined to think that this view correctly represents the result of the
provisions of S. 433 as much as of those contained in s. 86(1).
In view of. our conclusion that s. 86(1) applies to the present ,suit, it
follows that in the absence of the consent of the Central Government as
prescribed by it, the suit cannot be entertained. ,On that view of the matter,
it is not necessary to deal with the other question as to whether the
respondents were justified in claiming absolute immunity under International
Law. It is common ground that if there is a specific statutory provision such
as is contained in s. 86(1) which allows a suit to be filed against a foreign
State subject to certain conditions, it is the said statutory provision that
will govern the decision of the question as to whether the suit has been
properly filed or not. In dealing with such a question, it is unnecessary to
travel beyond the provisions of the statute, because the statute determines
the competence of the suit. The result is, the appeal fails and is dismissed.
