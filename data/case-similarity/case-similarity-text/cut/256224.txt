A decree for setting aside a document may be sought for in terms of Section 31
of the Specific Relief Act.
57
Applicability of Article 59 would indisputably depend upon the question as to
whether the deed of partition was required to be set aside or not. In view of
our findings aforementioned, it was required to be set aside. It is not a case
where the deed of partition by reason of purported wrong factual contention
raised in the plaint leading to grant of a consent decree was void ab initio.
It was not. The effect of it would be that the same was required be set aside.
[See Prem Singh (supra), M/s. Bay Berry Apartments Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Shobha
& Ors. 2006 (10) SCALE 596 and Utha Moidu Haji v. Kuningarath Kunhabdulla and
Ors. 2006 (14) SCALE 156] It must, therefore, be held that the suit was barred
by limitation.
58\. For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal which is
dismissed accordingly. No costs.
