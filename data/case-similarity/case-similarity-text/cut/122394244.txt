that, having W.P.(C) 1841/2018 Page 60 of 61 uninterruptedly served the
petitioner, solely and to the exclusion of all others, for 14 years, even
without any artificial break, the decision of the petitionerto summarily
terminate its relationship with Respondent No.2, by refusing to review the
agreement between them beyond 30 th April, 2012, amounts to ―retrenchment‖,
within the meaning of Section 25-F of the ID Act, read with Section 3 of the
Working Journalists Act. The said termination of employment has, therefore, to
be characterised as illegal, and the learned Labour Court cannot be said to
have fallen into error in so holding.
70\. I was of the view that, possibly, an amicable resolution, to the
controversy, could be achieved, for which purpose the parties were referred to
mediation. However, the said efforts proved futile.
71\. As a result, this Court has no option but to uphold the impugned Award of
the learned Labour Court in toto.
72\. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed.
