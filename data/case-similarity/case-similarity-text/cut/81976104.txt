document has been filed or evidence has been brought on record that the
construction of the appellants was protected under any law or that same was
raised with sanction. There are allegations of unauthorized construction in
the building from ground to third floor. Even as per admission of the
appellants, a fire broke out in the building in the year 2002 and major
portion thereof was destroyed. The appellants purchased property in the year
2016 and they appear to have reconstructed the same in the garb of repairs.
Even the MCD Appeal 32/17 M/s P.C.S. Associates & Ors. v. North DMC Page 8 of
9 photographs placed on record support the case of the North DMC regarding
existence of unauthorized construction in the building. Hence, the impugned
order dated 15.11.2017 for not granting interim stay is reasoned and
justified. There is no merit in the appeal. Same is accordingly dismissed.
File be consigned to record room.
