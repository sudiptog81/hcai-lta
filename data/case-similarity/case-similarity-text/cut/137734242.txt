appointment."
It is true that the material furnished before us would indicate that action
was taken on December 22, 1993 by the Ordinance Factory Board and circulated
for action to be taken by the Government and thereafter the Union Public
Service Commission was consulted. Action taken on this material should have
been taken much earlier to the date on which it was taken since they knew that
four members were due to retire in August, September, October 1994 and March
1995\. There were anticipated vacancies likely to arise on permanent basis and
promotion to them was to be made on regular basis. In other words, they were
all clear vacancies. So they were to be finalised before April 1994 and the
confidential reports should have been approved before 31st March 1993 and all
eligible candidates within the zone of consideration as on the date of D.P.C.
were entitled to be considered. The direction given be the Tribunal referred
to above is clearly in accordance with the procedure indicated hereinbefore.
Therefore, we do not find that the orders are vitiated by any error of law
