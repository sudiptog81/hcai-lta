Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes [1966] 17 S.T.C. 473 (S.C.),
the Supreme Court expressed the view that before a sale could be said to have
occasioned the import it was not necessary that the sale should have preceded
the import and that it is sufficient if the movement of the goods from the
foreign territory was incidental to, or in pursuance of, the contract between
the acutal importer and the local purchaser and if there was no possibility of
the goods being diverted by the importer for any other purpose. It is common
ground that the petitioner-society placed orders with the foreign seller only
after it entered into an agreement with the various allottees and that the
agreement between the petitioner-society and the allottees specifically
provided that the goods are to be imported from Ceylon and supplied to them as
per their requirements on the basis of the bulk licence given in the name of
the corporation. We, therefore, accept the contention of the petitioner that
even if the petitioner-society can be said to have sold the goods to the
allottees, such sales will be sales in the course of import.
