39.For grant of interim injunction, three cardinal steps have to be followed
viz., Prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury. In the
instant case, as already pointed out by the learned counsel for the
respondent, if an order of interim injunction is not granted, the appellants
would continue to make gain, thereby passing off their products using the
deceptively similar Trademark and in that event, there is irreparable loss
caused to the respondent. The Trial Court in paragraph 16 of its judgment has
clearly held that the grant of interim injunction will not affect the
appellants in any manner as they could sell their products using any other
brand name except "MRI" which is deceptively similar to the brand
http://www.judis.nic.in  29/31 C.M.A.No.2847 of 2016 name of the respondent
viz., "CRI".
40.For all the foregoing reasons, this Court finds no merit in the appeal and
hence, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed. The Trial Court is
directed to dispose of the matter before the end of December 2020\.
