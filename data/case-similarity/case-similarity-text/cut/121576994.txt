38\. According to the appellants, the notification is liable to be set aside
on the ground of vagueness and they argued that the expression like for SDH
application only is too vague to be acceptable in a taxing statute or
exemption notification. We are unable to agree with this contention because
expression for SDH application only is quite comprehensible and there is
nothing too esoteric about it. In our view there is nothing so vague or
incomprehensible about expressions like for SDH application only as to make
it impossible or impractical to implement the anti-dumping notification.
39\. The appellants also argued that software downloaded electronically cannot
be subjected to anti-dumping duty due to absence of mechanism to levy and
collect duty as has been held by CESTAT in the case of Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.
& Others Vs. C.C.(Export), New Delhi. (supra). We agree with the contention
and find it pertinent to add that as no duty can be levied and collected on
such downloads (as has been held by CESTAT in the case of Oracle India Pvt.
Ltd.), the appellants can have no grievance on that count.
