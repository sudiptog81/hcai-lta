and safety, thus interim order is necessary in the present case to be passed
against the defendants as the balance of convenience lies in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendants.
56\. Thus, the prayer made in the application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2
read with Section 151 CPC is allowed. The defendants are restrained during the
pendency of suit from using of trademark LUCYNTA in respect of pharmaceutical
and medicinal preparation and/or any mark which is deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's trade mark NUCYNTA.
57\. As the defendants have been using the trademark since October, 2011,
therefore, in the interest of justice, equity and fair play the defendants are
granted three months' time to dispose off the earlier stock bearing the mark
LUCYNTA.
58\. It is made clear that the finding arrived while disposing off the present
application are tentative and shall have no bearing when the matter is decided
at the final stage of suit after trial.
