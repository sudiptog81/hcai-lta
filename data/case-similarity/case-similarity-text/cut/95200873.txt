is dismissed.
17.0 Ground No.10 is related to the issue for rectification:
These issues are discussed in detail by the DRP. The assessee raised issues
for rectification against the order passed u/s.154. The appeal against the
order u/s.154 is a separate appeal which cannot be decided in this appeal. The
Ld.AR also has not brought on record any evidence to controvert the
observations made by DRP. Therefore, this ground is dismissed.
18.0 In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the Open Court on 28th April, 2017, at Chennai.
