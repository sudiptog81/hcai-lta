by the fact that after recording a finding on that score as noticed above, the
Commission passed an order of injunction in regard to an issue without however
any material on record. As a matter of fact there is no evidence of a single
consumer being misled and not a whisper as to what constitute an unfair trade
practice pertaining to "Suraksha Chakra". The Commission also thought it fit
not to record any reason or justification for the grant of an interim order of
injunction in spite of finding as above and before the matter is investigated
and complaint is finally heard. This apart, the factum of non-availability of
any explanation of more than 13 years delay has also not been delved into by
the Commission at all. In that view of the matter question of there being any
order of injunction at this stage of the proceeding on the face of the finding
as passed by the Commission itself does not and cannot arise. The Appeal
No.2620 of 1998 (Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. vs. Hindustan Lever Ltd.)
therefore succeeds: The Appeal as filed by the complainant being No.3288 of
1998 (Hindustan Lever Ltd. vs. Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd.) stands
