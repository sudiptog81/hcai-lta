appropriate directions in terms of the provisions of the Act and the
Regulations in force.
In our considered view the scheme and essence of the Act and the Regulations
are clearly suggestive of speedy and expeditious disposal of the matters.
Thus, it will be desirable that the Competent Authority frames Regulations
providing definite time frame for completion of investigation, inquiry and
final disposal of the matters pending before the Commission. Till such
Regulations are framed, the period specified by us supra shall remain in force
and we expect all the concerned authorities to adhere to the period specified.
Resultantly, this appeal is partially allowed. The order dated 15th February,
2010 passed by the Tribunal is modified to the above extent. The Commission
shall proceed with the case in accordance with law and the principles
enunciated supra.
In the circumstances there will be no order as to costs. 83
