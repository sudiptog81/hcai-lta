plaint from the beginning but as it had not complied with the rules concerning
a plaint it had been a plaint irregularly filed. First, the respondents never
contended that they had filed a plaint. They said, they had filed a written
statement in which they had made a counter- claim and that counter-claim was
maintainable as such. That was their contention. They persisted in this
attitude all through. They did not even raise an issue as to whether they were
entitled to treat the counter-claim as a plaint. It would be strange if the
Court said that the respondents had filed a plaint though they did not
themselves say so. Secondly, I am not aware that a plaint and a written
statement can be combined in one pleading so that the filing of the one is the
filing of the other. This is impossible under our procedure. It must be taken
that what had originally been filed was a written statement, and, therefore,
that no plaint had at all been filed. If no plaint had been filed, no question
of curing any irregularity in the filing of a plaint can arise.
