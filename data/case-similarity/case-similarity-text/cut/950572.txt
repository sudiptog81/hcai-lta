context of Article 226 of the Constitution as the Court exercises
extraordinary jurisdiction in writ petitions and it is trite law that the
jurisdiction under Article 226 is discretionary. That would not be a position
when a suit is filed, as in the instant case, and if it is established that
even a part of cause of action has arisen, there is no question of then
refusing to exercise the jurisdiction. I may state that though counsel for the
plaintiff conceded that the filing of application for registration of the
trade mark in the Trade Mark Registry, Delhi would not give jurisdiction to
this Court. In a recent judgment of this Court, (per Hon'ble Mr. Justice Badar
Durrez Ahmed in IA No. 1347/2006 in CS (OS) No. 311/2005- Pfizer Products,
Inc. v. Rajesh Chopra and Ors., decided on 8th February 2006) after discussing
the judgment in the case of Dhodha House v. S.K. Maingi (supra) the Hon'ble
Judge has opined that the application for registration in the Trade Mark
Registry in Delhi would also confer jurisdiction in this Court. This
application is, therefore, rejected.
