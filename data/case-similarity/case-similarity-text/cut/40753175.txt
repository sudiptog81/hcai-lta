Full justification supported by facts and figures have been given to
demonstrate that the increase in the employees cost, finance charges,
administrative expenses, depreciation cost and capacity increase have
contributed to the continuous losses. The comparative position over a period
of 5 years from 1998 to 2003 with relevant figures have been given before the
CIT (Appeals) and they are referred to in a tabular form in his order in
paragraph 5.5.1. In fact there are four tabular statements furnished by the
assessee before the CIT (Appeals) in support of the reasons for the continuous
losses. There is no material brought by the revenue either before the CIT
(Appeals) or before the Tribunal or ITA Nos.1068 & 1070/2011 Page 24 of 25
even before us to show that these are incorrect figures or that even on merits
the reasons for the losses are not genuine.
24\. We are, therefore, unable to hold that the Tribunal committed any error
in confirming the order of the CIT (Appeals) for both the years deleting the
disallowance of the brand fee/ royalty payment while determining the ALP.
