[1] Despite the case having been called out twice, no one has put in
appearance on behalf of the petitioners. Even on the last date of hearing
(i.e. on 11.04.2019), none was present on behalf of the petitioners. It
appears that the petitioners are not interested in pursuing the present
Revision Petition.
    [2]          Dismissed in default.
                                                     (B.S. Walia)
                                                        Judge
