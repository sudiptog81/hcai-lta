20\. The learned single Judge, while disposing of Civil Writ No. 2494 of 1969,
which is the subject-matter of L.P.A. No. ,515 of 1970, has, on consideration
of the legal position, observed :
The petitioner-company was not required to include in its turnover the
purchase of cotton when it was not the last purchaser thereof irrespective of
the fact that cotton seeds remained with it.
21\. This is the basis on which the decisions in all these cases proceed.
These observations, if I may say so with respect, are in accord with the
dictum of their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the cases noticed above. I,
thus, see no infirmity in the judgments under appeal before us to warrant
interference. I would, accordingly, dismiss all the Letters Patent appeals
(detailed in the opening part of this judgment) and allow Civil Writ No. 96 of
1971. The impugned orders in the latter case are quashed. The assessing
authority will, however, be at liberty to make fresh assessments in accordance
