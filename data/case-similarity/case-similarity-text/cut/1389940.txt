"DROPOVIT" did: not strike even Messrs Depenning and DePenning the legal
advisers of the appellant as being descriptive. It was also pointed out that
in his judgment Mr. Justice Tarkunde has remarked that when the case was
opened before, him he did not understand that the word "DROPOVIT" meant "DROP
OF VITAMIN" till the explanation of that word was given to. him. We see no
reason, therefore, to differ from the reasoning of the High Court on this
'aspect of the case. If the word "DROPOVIT" is not a descriptive word it must
be held to be an invented word. It is true that the word "DROPOVIT" is coined
out of words commonly used by and known to ordinary persons knowing English.
But the resulting combination produces a new word, a newly coined word which
does not remind an ordinary person knowing English of the original words out
of which it is coined unless he is so told or unless at least he devotes some
thought to it. It follows that the word "DROPOVIT" being an invented word was
entitled to be registered as 'a trade mark and is not liable to be removed
