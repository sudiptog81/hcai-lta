Bench that the assessments in dispute subsist by virtue of the provisions of
the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act (Act 9 of 1970).
60\. Our answer to the question of law raised in the tax revision cases is in
the negative; the finding of the Tribunal that an assessment which is
subsisting cannot be enforced after the retrospective levy of tax and
validation of the assessments without making further assessments, is not
correct. The taxes due and payable as per such subsisting orders of assessment
can be recovered even if such taxes were earlier refunded to the assessees.
61\. These tax revision cases, therefore, succeed and are accordingly allowed;
but, in the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
Advocate's fee Rs. 250 in each.
62\. We are unable to certify that these tax revision cases involve such sub-
stantial question of law of general importance as require the consideration of
the Supreme Court or otherwise fit cases for grant of leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court. Leave refused.
