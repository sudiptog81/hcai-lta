Delhi. They are dealing with the supply of excisable liquor and they do not
also have any licence for supply of their product in Delhi. The defendants are
also not having their office including the registered office within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor do they have a manufacturing unit in Delhi.
They have also not applied for the registration of their trade mark within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor have they applied for obtaining any excise
licence for supply/sale of their products within jurisdiction of this Court.
No part of cause of action has thus arisen within the jurisdiction of this
Court. The Court, therefore, has no territorial jurisdiction. The plaint is
returned to the plaintiffs for filing in the Court of appropriate
jurisdiction. In view of the above, the interim order dated 23.03.2015 stands
vacated.
The Registrar is directed to do the needful.
The petition along with pending applications stands disposed of in these
terms.
