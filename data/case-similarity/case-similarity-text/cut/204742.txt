"An advocate abusing the process of court is guilty of misconduct. When
witnesses are present in the court for examination the advocate concerned has
a duty to see that their examination is conducted. We remind that witnesses
who come to the court, on being called by the court, do so as they have no
other option, and such witnesses are also responsible citizens who have other
work to attend to for eking out a livelihood. They cannot be treated as less
respectable to be told to come again and again just to suit the convenience of
the advocate concerned. If the advocate has any unavoidable inconvenience it
is his duty to make other arrangements for examining the witnesses who are
present in the court. Seeking adjournments for postponing the examination of
the witnesses who are present in court even without making other arrangements
for examining such witnesses is a dereliction of an advocate's duty to the
court as that would cause much harassment and hardship to the witnesses. Such
dereliction if repeated would amount to misconduct of the advocate concerned.
Legal profession must be purified from such abuses of the court procedures.
