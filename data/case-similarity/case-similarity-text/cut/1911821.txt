Under Section 10 of the RTI Act, it is possible to severe certain portions of
the information before disclosing it to an applicant to ensure that
information that is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act is not disclosed.
Therefore, this Commission has decided to apply Section 10 of the RTI Act to
the information sought by the Appellant in queries 1, 2 and 3. Details of
customer related information and particulars of informers/ whistle blowers/
source of information contained in the inspection report shall be blanked out
and then provided to the Appellant.
The Appeal is allowed. The PIO is directed to provide the complete information
in relation to queries 1, 2 and 3 of the RTI application to the Appellant
before 15 December 2011 after severing details of customer related information
and particulars of informers/ whistle blowers/ source of information.
Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties.
