15\. Since the ld.CIT(A) has restricted the disallowance at 12.5% on the basis
of finding recorded in the Asstt.Year 2011-12, but that finding of the
ld.CIT(A) was not upheld by the ITAT, and has scaled down to 2%. Therefore,
respectfully following the order of the Co-ordinate Bench, we allow this
ground of appeal and direct the AO to compute disallowance out of labour
expenses at 25% of the total labour payment made by the assessee. In other
words, it should 2% (two percent) of Rs.1,90,43,133/-. This ground of appeal
is partly allowed.
16\. In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
