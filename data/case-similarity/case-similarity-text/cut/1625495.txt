order of the Court. On the 19th August 1873, the same Court ordered that he
should deliver up the property to the plaintiff or his vendor. This order he
disobeyed. Up to the date of this order, it may be taken that his detention of
the property was lawful. But from the moment the latter order was made, his
possession of the property became unlawful. Article 49 says, that in a suit
for specific moveable property the period of limitation is three years running
or commencing from the time that the obtainer's possession became unlawful.
The present suit, therefore, comes strictly within that article, and not
having boon brought until the 22nd of March 1878, is clearly barred.

receiving of a legacy is applicable, because this specific property was
originally bequeathed to the plaintiff's vendor under a will. But the answer
to this argument is, that the property to which this suit relates is not
sought to be recovered as a legacy, but as property which belongs to the
plaintiff, and has been unlawfully detained by the defendant No. 1. Article
