Section 45 in The Trade Marks Act, 1999
45\. Registration of assignments and transmissions.â€”
(1) Where a person becomes entitled by assignment or transmission to a
registered trade mark, he shall apply in the prescribed manner to the
Registrar to register his title, and the Registrar shall, on receipt of the
application and on proof of title to his satisfaction, register him as the
proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods or services in respect of
which the assignment or transmission has effect, and shall cause particulars
of the assignment or transmission to be entered on the register: Provided that
where the validity of an assignment or transmission is in dispute between the
parties, the Registrar may refuse to register the assignment or transmission
until the rights of the parties have been determined by a competent court.
(2) Except for the purpose of an application before the Registrar under sub-
section (1) or an appeal from an order thereon, or an application under
section 57 or an appeal from an order thereon, a document or instrument in
respect of which no entry has been made in the register in accordance with
sub-section (1), shall not be admitted in evidence by the Registrar or the
Appellate Board or any court in proof of title to the trade mark by assignment
or transmission unless the Registrar or the Appellate Board or the court, as
the case may be, otherwise directs.
