defendant even today is carrying on its business and is selling bottles in
different designs, as shown in list of documents filed by the plaintiff on
16.07.2018 containing photographs of five such different bottles. Such bottles
were also produced in the court, hence it cannot be said the defendant is
suffering irreparable loss and injury due to interim injunction granted.
48\. Hence the facts stated above do show the plaintiff has the prima facie
case in its favour and if injunction is not granted the plaintiff shall suffer
irreparable loss/injury and the balance of convenience is also in its favour.
Hence the IA No.14512/2014 in CS(COMM) 630/2018 and 14515/2014 in CS (COMM)
631/2018 is allowed. IA No.10831/2015 in CS(COMM) 630/2018 and IA
No.10849/2015 in CS (COMM) 631/2018 is dismissed.
