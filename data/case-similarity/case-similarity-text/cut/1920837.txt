therefore, rightly, decreed in respondent's favour.
Unfortunately such claim for interest that was allowed in respondent's favour
by the District Court and confirmed by the High Court was at the rate of 6 per
cent per annum though interest at 12 per cent had been claimed by the
respondent in his suit. However, since the respondent acquiesced in his claim
being decreed at 6 per cent by not preferring any cross objections in the High
Court it could not be proper for us to enhance the rate to 12 per cent per
annum which we were otherwise inclined to grant.
We are also of the view that the State Government is being rightly saddled
with a liability for the culpable neglect in the discharge of his duty by the
District Treasury Officer who delayed the issuance of the L.P.C. but since the
concerned officer had not been impleaded as a party defendant to the suit the
Court is unable to hold him liable for the decretal amount. It will, however,
be for the State Government to consider whether the erring official should or
should not be directed to compensate the Government the loss sustained by it
