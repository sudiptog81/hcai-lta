In view of the above judgments, the view of this court in B.K.Kapoor & anr and
M/s Sharda Ginning Pressing & Oil Mills is not the correct view. The judgment
in Olympus Superstructures (P) Ltd. (supra) was not brought to the notice of
the court in the aforesaid cases. The other judgment in Booz Allen and
Hamilton Inc. (Supra) came to be delivered recently. Therefore, the judgments
relied upon by learned counsel for the respondent no longer hold good and are
not a binding precedent. The judgment of the Company Court to order winding up
is an order in-rem whereas; the order of  Arb. Case No. 90 of 2011 14
dissolution of partnership is order in-personam. Therefore, Section 44 of the
Act does not oust the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to consider the
dissolution of the firm.
In view of the above, the disputes between parties are required to be decided
by an arbitrator. Shri U.B. Khanduja, former Additional District and Sessions
Judge resident of H. No. 792-A, Sector 8, Panchkula is appointed as
Arbitrator. He shall be entitled to fee as per Punjab and Haryana High Court
