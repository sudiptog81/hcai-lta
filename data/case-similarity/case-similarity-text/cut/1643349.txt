members of the Association and therefore the other members of the Association
are not parties to the suit. Hence, the Trial Court by disallowing the other
half costs of the suit made these respondents personally liable to bear those
costs of the suit which they cannot realise from the other members of the
Association. This fact was overlooked by the Trial Court and therefore in our
opinion, their cross objection should be allowed.
68\. Mr, Dhar contended that Mr. Goswami should pay those costs but Mr. Bagehi
contended otherwise and said that appellant should pay them. We are unable to
accept the contention of Mr. Bagehi because Mr. Goswami has put these
respondents to this loss by not obtaining leave under Order 1, Rule 8 of the
Code. Further, in the absence of these two respondents it would have been
impossible for Mr. Goswami to prove his case against the appellant on the
question of agency. He had taken full ad-vanlage of their presence and at the
same time by not suing them in their representative capacity has put them into
that loss.
