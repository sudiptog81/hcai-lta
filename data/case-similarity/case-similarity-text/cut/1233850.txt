away or disturb any manufacturer's pre-existing accrued right of exemption for
a period of 7 years. If SRO 38/98 is construed as now contended by the
respondent, then the inevitable consequence would be that SRO 38/98 would
itself be rendered ultra vires Section 10(3) of the Act, and therefore,
illegal, bad in law and null and void.
We do not agree with the submission made by the learned counsel for the
respondent/State that subsequent notification was classificatory in nature.
That it only removed the doubt which had arisen with reference to "compound
rubber" in the SRO 1729/93. Making of "compound rubber" had been accepted to
be "manufacture" in the Memorandum of Undertaking entered between MRF and the
Government on 6.10.1993 and the addendum dated 10.4.1996 to the Memorandum of
Undertaking dated 6.10.1993. It is further recognized in the eligibility
certificate issued by the Director of Industries and Commerce after
investigation and due verification and the exemption certificate issued by the
Board of Revenue.
