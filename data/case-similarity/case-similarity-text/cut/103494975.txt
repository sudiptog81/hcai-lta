identifying the size of vehicle and the destination to ascertain toll charges.
Thereafter toll ticket is issued and money is collected. In view of above
activities undertaken by the appellant, they would also be covered under
clause (iv) of the definition of BAS. 4.6 In view of the above we are of the
opinion that the decision in case of Intertoll India Consultants (P) Ltd.
(supra) is per incurium as it ignores the common parlance definition of the
term 'Customer'. As described above the activity of the appellant 14 | P a g e
ST/109/2010-DB would be squarely covered by definition of BAS and would be
chargeable to service tax during period prior to 10.09.2004 also. 4.7 The
appellants have sought benefit of limitation. We find that the appellants are
providing the BAS and there is no doubt regarding the same. Merely, because
they are collecting the said amount on behalf of the corporate entity backed
by Government it does not constitute a bonafide belief for exemption. The
definition of BAS is very clear. Thus, they cannot be given any benefit on
account of limitation.
