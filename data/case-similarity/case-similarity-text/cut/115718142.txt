counsel appearing for the defendants nevertheless states that since the nature
of production of the applicant's/plaintiff's film is different from that of
the defendants they could have no objection for any benefit that would flow
out of the production of the short film of the applicant/plaintiff. They are
not opposed with the right, title and claim with the State of Tamil Nadu as
far as applicant's short film DVD Movie is concerned.
