Adinarayana 2003 (3) TAC 98 Orissa, wherein this Court came to the conclusion
that the finding arrived at by the Commissioner on the cause of the accident
being a finding of fact is unassailable and cannot be interfered with in
appeal by the High Court.
10\. Relying upon the observations of the Apex Court as noted hereinabove, I
am of the view that in the case at hand, fraud was not pleaded by the
Appellants in the written statement nor was any evidence in support of such
plea brought on record and, therefore, in the present appeal I am not inclined
to enter into the plea of fraud as raised by the Appellant since I am of the
view that in course of exercise of the Appellate jurisdiction of this Court,
accepting such plea would tantamount to permitting a party to raise an
objection which is otherwise not entertainable in law.
11\. In view of the findings arrived hereinabove, I am of the considered view
that no substantial question of law has arisen in the present case and the
order of Workmen's Compensation Commissioner being based on evidence on record
