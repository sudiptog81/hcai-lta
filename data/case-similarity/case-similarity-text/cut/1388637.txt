from the record of the case, the opposite party No. 1 cannot be directed to
pay the arrears even today. Before parting with the case I would like to add
that it is commendable that in spite of such a heavy financial constrains, the
opposite party No. 1 had paid the revised pay scales in spite of the fact that
the Corporation is out of production for last 5 years. It is apparent from the
record that the opposite party is unable to pay the arrears of the revised pay
scale. The financial constrains pleaded by opposite party No. 1 appear to be
real and genuine. It is abundantly clear from the record that opposite party
No. 1 singularly made the sincere efforts to remove the financial constrains
but in vein. There is nothing on the record to show that the petitioner's
association has extended any kind of co-operation with the Management in its
efforts to revive and rehabilitate the Corporation, which perhaps would have
made it feasible for the Corporation to pay the arrears accrued due to
revision of the pay scale. The petitioner's sole interest seems to be to have
the pound's flesh at the cost of Corporation.
