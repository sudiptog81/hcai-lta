18\. The assessee has filed these cross objections in support of order of the
Ld. CIT(A). Although, the assessee has filed one more ground challenging
validity of penalty proceedings initiated u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, in light
of show cause notice issued by the A.O u/s 274 r.w.s 271 of the Act, but fact
remains that the penalty levied by the A.O u/s 271(1)(c) has been deleted for
all assessment years. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Cross
Objections filed by the assessee for all assessment years becomes infructuous
and hence, the same were dismissed as not maintainable.
19\. In the result, the appeals filed by the Revenue and Cross Objections
filed by the assessee are dismissed.
