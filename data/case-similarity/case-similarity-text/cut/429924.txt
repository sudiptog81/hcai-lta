held that an expenditure incurred with a view to bring into existence a new
asset or an advantage of enduring nature cannot qualify for deduction under
Section 10(2)(v).
In our opinion the test involved by Chagla C.J. in New shorrock Spinning &
Manufacturing Company Limited is the most appropriate one having regard to the
context in which the said expression occurs. It has also been followed by a
majority of the High Courts in India. We respectfully accept and adopt the
test.
Applying he aforesaid test, if we look at the facts of this case, it will be
evident that what the assessee did was not mere repairs but a total renovation
of the theatre. New machinery, new furniture, new sanitary fittings and new
electrical wiring were installed besides extensively repairing the structure
of the building. By no stretch of imagination, can it be said that the said
repairs qualify as "current repairs" within the meaning of Section 10(2)(v).
It was a case of total renovation and has rightly been held by the High Court
