it must be adjudicated upon within a further period of one month after giving
proper opportunity to be heard to the appellant. If no such claim is made, or,
if made, not adjudicated upon within the time specified, the State will refund
the amount of sales tax to the appellant with interest thereon at the rate of
6% per annum from the date when such refund becomes due and if such claim is
made and adjudicated upon within the specified time and it is found that a
part of this amount is liable to be retained by the State under some provision
of law, the State will refund the balance to the appellant with interest at
the like rate. So far as the assessment years 1971-72, 1972- 73 and 1973-74
are concerned, the Sales Tax Authorities will proceed to complete the
Assessments for those assessment years in the light of the law laid down in
this judgment and the amounts of sales tax deposited by the appellant will be
refunded to the appellant to the extent to which they are not found due and
payable as a result of the assessments, subject to any claim which the State
may have to retain those amounts under any provision of law.
