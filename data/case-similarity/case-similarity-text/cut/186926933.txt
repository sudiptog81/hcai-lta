assessment framed was void ab initio and accordingly the same is quashed.
Since, we have quashed the assessment framed by the AO therefore no separate
finding is being given on the issues raised in the Departmental appeal.
13\. In the result, the appeal of the Department is dismissed and cross
objections of the assessee are allowed.
