preceding paras, grounds no. 7 & 8 are academic and do not need any
adjudication at this stage. GROUND NO.9
34\. Ground No.9 is premature and does not require any adjudication.
35\. Additional ground raised by the taxpayer needs no adjudication as it has
since become infructuous in view of the order passed by AO u/s 154 of the Act.
36\. Resultantly, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed.
Order pronounced in open court on this 25th day of October, 2017.
