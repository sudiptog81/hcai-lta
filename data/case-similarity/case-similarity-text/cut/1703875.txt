T.B. Kadam [(1976) 3 SCC 71], U.P.SRTC v. Basudeo Chaudhary [(1997) 11 SCC
370], Janatha Bazar (south kanara Central Coop. Wholesale Stores Ltd.) v.
Sahakari Noukarara Sangha [(2000) 7 SCC 517], Karnataka SRTC v. B.S.
Hullikatti [(2001) 2 SCC 574] and Rajasthan SRTC v. Ghanshyam Sharma [(2002)
10 SCC 330].
23\. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh [(2006) 6 SCC 187] and U.P. SRTC v. Vinod Kumar
[(2008) 1 SCC 115] this Court held that the punishment should always be
proportionate to the gravity of the misconduct. However, in a case of
corruption/ misappropriation, the only punishment is dismissal.
24\. This, in view of the above, the contention raised on behalf of the
employee that punishment of dismissal from service was disproportionate to the
proved delinquency of the employee, is not worth acceptance."
33.Hence in the light of the discussions made above both on facts and law,
this Court does not find any ground to interfere with the order of dismissal
passed by the first respondent. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is dismissed.
