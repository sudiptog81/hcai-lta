inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years or more before
the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending
with concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim
orders passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9\. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action
to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land  319 acquisition.
Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the
Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims
and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the
legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit
of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.
Let the matters be placed before appropriate Bench for consideration on
merits.
