interpret the said section literally.
29\. It was also Mr. Kohli's argument that the creation of a sub-class within
a class would be unconstitutional. If that is so, the Plaintiff's remedy would
be to challenge the vires of Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act for in
its present form, I am bound with the letter of law written therein and cannot
interpret the said provision as Mr. Kohli would have it.
30\. I therefore hold that the amendments introduced to the CPC by the
Commercial Courts Act are only applicable to Commercial Disputes of a
Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value such as
the present suit. Consequently, amongst other amendments introduced to the CPC
by the Commercial Courts Act, the amendment to the CPC mandating that a
Written Statement in a Commercial Suit has to be filed within 120 days, will
not apply to Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value.
