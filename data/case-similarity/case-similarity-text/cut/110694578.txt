order as to quantum of costs is deferred till the final decision of this suit.
The plaintiff has submitted the actual cost of Rs.43,60,250/- incurred by them
in this matter. Considering the high cost of litigation incurred by both the
parties, this Court is concerned about the future cost of litigation. Both the
parties are, therefore, directed to submit their estimate of future cost
before the commencement of trial so that the parties shall have notice of
actual cost that the other side estimate would be incurring in the course of
litigation and the parties have an opportunity to take appropriate decision as
to manner in which to conduct the litigation. Greater transparency about cost
will promote access to justice. This process shall also keep the cost in check
and potentially eliminate the need for a detailed assessment at the end as
well as dispute as to the amount of the actual cost. This Court shall consider
all these matters and shall pass appropriate order covering the entire gamut
of the issue relating to costs at the stage of final arguments.
