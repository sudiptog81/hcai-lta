the aforesaid count.
60\. Before concluding, it may be pointed out that whereas the Informant in
the present case has made diverse allegations as delineated in the order, in
the bunch of cases against sugar mills (Case Nos. 21, 29, 36, 47, 48 and 49 of
2013) pending further investigation before the DG, issues under investigation
are mainly two fold: first, the issue is joint tendering by the OMCs and
second, is the bid rigging by sugar mills in respect of joint tender dated
02.01.2013 floated by the OMCs. Both these issues shall be dealt with in those
cases separately.
61\. Based on the above discussion, the Commission is of the opinion that no
case of contravention of the provisions of the Act is made out against the
OPs.
Case No. 94 of 2014 22
62\. The Secretary is directed to inform the parties accordingly.
