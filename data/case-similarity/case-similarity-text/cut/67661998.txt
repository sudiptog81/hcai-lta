1,00,000/- on HUAWEI under Section 112 of the Customs Act. These two companies
were the exporters of the impugned goods from Korea and China. Against the
original order, on their appeal the Tribunal set aside the penalties on them.
They were not parties to the further appeals before the Honble Supreme Court.
We find that these two appellants in the first round of decision by the
Tribunal are not liable to any penalty as there was no justification for the
same.
Summing up :-
For the reasons and on the analysis above;
(a) We uphold the impugned orders in so far as they relate to valuation and
assessment of imported Fixed Wireless Telephones (FWT) considering them as
single goods for assessment without any segregation of value for software ;
(b) the appellant/assessees are not liable to interest, redemption fine and
penalties ; and
(c) Penalties on other appellants (individuals and the exporting companies)
