inconvenience, in our opinion, cannot affect the plain language of Art. 226,
nor can the concept of the place of cause of action be introduced into it for
that would do away with the two limitations on the powers of the High Court
contained in it."
In view of clause 2 of Article 226 of the Constitution of India now if a part
of cause of action arises outside the jurisdiction of the High Court, it would
have jurisdiction to issue a writ. The decision in Khajoor Singh (supra) has,
thus, no application.
Forum Conveniens We must, however, remind ourselves that even if a small part
of cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of the High
Court, the same by itself may not be considered to be a determinative factor
compelling the High Court to decide the matter on merit. In appropriate cases,
the Court may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction by invoking
the doctrine of forum conveniens. (See Bhagar Singh Bagga v. Dewan Jagbir
