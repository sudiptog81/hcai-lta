Kumar & others [AIR 1970 SC 833], wherein it has been stated in unmistakable
terms that an Award is not a mere waste paper but does create rights and has
some legal effect besides being final and binding on the parties. It has also
been held that the award is, in fact, a final adjudication of a Court of the
parties own choice and until impeached upon sufficient grounds in an
appropriate proceedings, an award which is on the face of it regular, is
conclusive upon the merits of the controversy submitted for arbitration.
Consequently, the post award proceedings cannot be considered by any means, to
be a suit or other proceedings to enforce any rights arising under a contract.
All the more so when, as in this case, at all stages the respondent was only
on the defence and has not itself instituted any proceedings to enforce any
rights of the nature prohibited under Section 69 of the Partnership Act,
before any Court as such. We see no infirmity or error whatsoever in the
decision of the courts below to call for our interference in this appeal. The
appeal fails and shall stand dismissed.
