his release. However, he has denied the allegation of snatching of money from
him but from his own defence, it is evident that he had accepted the incident
except of course that he had not snatched the money.
On the basis of the materials on record, the enquiry officer held the writ
petitioner guilty with which the disciplinary authority as also the appellate
authority agreed. It is well settled that High Court while exercising the
power of judicial review from the order of the disciplinary authority do not
act as a Court of appeal and appraise evidence. It interferes with the finding
of enquiry officer only when the finding is found to be perverse. We are of
the opinion that the Division Bench of the High Court erred in setting aside
the order of learned Single Judge and quashing the order of compulsory
retirement. The finding recorded by the enquiry officer is based on the
materials on record and on proper appreciation of evidence which cannot be
said to be perverse calling for interference by the High Court in exercise of
its power of judicial review.
