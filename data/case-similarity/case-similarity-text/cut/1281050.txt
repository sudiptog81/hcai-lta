petition was commenced by the appellant bona fide 1058 with a view to
protecting his own interest. Moreover, the writ petition was filed by the
appellant more than five months after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th
respondents and during this period, the 4th respondents incurred considerable
expenditure aggregating to about Rs. 1,25,000/- in making arrangements for
putting up the restaurant and the snack bars and in fact set up the snack bars
and started running the same. It would now be most inequitous to set aside the
contracts of the 4th respondents at the instance of the appellant. The
position would have been different if the appellant had filed the writ
petition immediately after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents
but the appellant allowed a period of over five months to elapse during which
the 4th respondents altered their position. We are, therefore, of the view
that this is not a fit case in which we should interfere and grant relief to
the appellant in the exercise of our discretion under Article 136 read with
Article 226 of the Constitution.
