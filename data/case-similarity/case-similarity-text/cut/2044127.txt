in the two cartons inasmuch as the respondent- plaintiffs carton mentioned the
words "MODEL TB-212 (in-door type)" while the appellant has also mentioned the
words "MODEL MT-212 (Indoor Unit)". Hence, he submitted that there was a
resemblance to the extent of the word "MODEL" and the figure "212".On a
perusal, we do not find any such resemblance between the two descriptions. He
then submitted that whereas the respondent-plaintiff had mentioned the words
"Best for Colour Black and White TVs & FM Radio" with a black rectangular
background of the word 'White' before the words "TVs and FM Radios", the
appellant has also mentioned words "For Colour/Black & White TVs. and FM
Radios". Again, we do not find that the manner in which the said words are
written by both the parties on their respective Cartons are likely to misguide
or confuse the buyers. This is apart from the fact that whereas the
respondent-plaintiff's carton is in black and white the appellant's carton is
fully in colour.
6\. Hence we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High
