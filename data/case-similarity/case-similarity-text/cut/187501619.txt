two conditions regarding pre-qualification criteria and the evaluation
criteria. On perusal of all the materials, we are satisfied that the impugned
conditions do not, in any way, could be classified as arbitrary,
discriminatory or mala fide.
32) The learned single Judge considered all these aspects in detail and after
finding that those two conditions cannot be said to be discriminatory and
unreasonable refused to interfere exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of
the Constitution and dismissed the writ petition. The well reasoned judgment
of the learned single Judge was affirmed by the Division Bench of the High
Court.
33) In the light of what is stated above, we fully agree with the reasoning of
the High Court and do not find any valid ground for interference.
Consequently, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed with no order as to
costs.
