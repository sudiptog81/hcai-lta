and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or
abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration,
or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor
should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest
officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where
75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting
and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular

authorities prioritising `information furnishing', at the cost of their normal
and regular duties.
Conclusion

is affirmed, subject to the clarifications regarding the scope of the RTI  54
