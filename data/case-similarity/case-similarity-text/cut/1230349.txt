perform the same functions and duties as other drivers in service of the Delhi
Administration and the Central Government. If anything, by reason of their
investiture with the 'powers, functions and privileges of a police officer',
their duties and responsibilities are more arduous. In answer to the
allegation in the petition that the driver-constables of the Delhi Police
Force perform no less arduous duties than drivers in other departments, it was
admitted by the respondents in their counter that the duties of the driver-
constables of the Delhi Police Force were onerous. What then is the reason for
giving them a lower scale of pay than others ? There is none. The only answer
of the respondents is that the drivers of the Delhi Police Force and the other
drivers belong to different departments and that the principle of equal pay
for equal work is not a principle which the Courts may recognise and act upon.
We have shown that the answer is unsound. The clarification is irrational. We,
therefore, allow the Writ Petition and direct the respondents to fix the scale
of pay of the petitioner and the drivers-constables of the Delhi Police Force
