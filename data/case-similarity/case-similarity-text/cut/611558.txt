independently on the evidence placed before it. Otherwise, there is a danger
of a contention being advanced that whenever an assessee or any other person
liable under the Act had failed to convince the authorities in the proceedings
under the Act that he has not deliberately made any false statement or that he
has not fabricated any material evidence, the conviction of such person should
invariably follow in the criminal court."
14\. The allegation now made against the petitioner is that he filed false
returns of income and fabricated and manipulated false accounts and other
documents while filing the returns for the assessment year 1983-84 (accounting
year 1982-83). The Tribunal's order and the order of the Commissioner
(Appeals), as stated earlier, have not gone to state that the accounts
produced by the petitioner and the return of income filed by him are correct.
So, the criminal court has to go into the question as to whether the
complainant succeeds in bringing out the offence charged against the
petitioner. The second ground urged by the petitioner is answered accordingly.
