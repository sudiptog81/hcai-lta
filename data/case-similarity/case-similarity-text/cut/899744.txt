appellate function or exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging the
validity of the decision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of a sound
judicial system. Another rationale is that the affected party can know why the
decision has gone against him. One of the salutary requirements of natural
justice is spelling out reasons for the order made, in other words, a speaking
out. The "inscrutable face of a sphinx" is ordinarily incongruous with a
judicial or quasi-judicial performance. But as noted above, the proceedings
commenced in 1981. The employee was placed under suspension from 1983 to 1988
and has superannuated in 2002. Acquittal in the criminal case is not
determinative of the commission of misconduct or otherwise, and it is open to
the authorities to proceed with the disciplinary proceedings, notwithstanding
acquittal in criminal case. It per se would not entitle the employee to claim
immunity from the proceedings. At the most the factum of acquittal may be a
circumstance to be considered while awarding punishment. It would depend upon
facts of each case and even that cannot have universal application.
