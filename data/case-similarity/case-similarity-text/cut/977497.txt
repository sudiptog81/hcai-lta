with his additions and improvements. Under the guise of the copyright, the
plaintiffs cannot ask the Court to restrain the defendants from making this
material available to public. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the
judgments/orders published by the plaintiffs in their law reports "Supreme
Court Cases" is not their original literary work but has been composed of,
compiled and prepared from and reproduction of the judgments of the Supreme
Court of India, open to all. I am also of the opinion that merely by
correcting certain typographical or grammatical mistakes in the raw source and
by adding commas, full stops and by giving paragraph numbers to the judgment
will not their work as the original literary work entitled to protection under
the Copyright Act. Plaintiffs, therefore, have no copyright in the judgments
published in their law reports. There being no copyright in the plaintiffs,
there is no question of the defendant infringing any alleged copyright.
Plaintiffs have failed to make out any prima-facie case in their favor and
are, therefore, not entitled to any relief in the application.
