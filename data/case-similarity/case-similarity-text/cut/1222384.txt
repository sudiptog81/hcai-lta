judgment of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and examine it, we find that he has not
sought to draw support for the rule from the equality clause of the United
States Constitution but evolved it purely as a result of administrative law.
Even in England, the recent trend in administrative law is in that direction
as is evident from what is stated at pages 540-541 in Prof. Wade's
Administrative Law 4th Edn. There is no reason why we should hesitate to adopt
this rule as a part of our continually expanding administrative law."
23\. Had paragraph 3.1 not been in the advertisement of the UPSC it is
possible that we may have taken a view in favour of the respondents since in
that case it was open to the UPSC to resort to any rational method of short-
listing of its choosing (provided it was fair and objective). However, in the
present case, a particular manner of short-listing has been prescribed in
paragraph 3.1. Hence, it is not open to the UPSC to resort to any other method
of short-listing even if such other method can be said to be fair and
objective.
