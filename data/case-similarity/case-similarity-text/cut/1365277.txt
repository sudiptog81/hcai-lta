does not mean that the 1st accused was not in charge of the business, or that
he was not actually conducting the business. The situation may be different
where there are joint licenses, or where the business is done by an
incorporated body; but, there is no room in this case for holding that the 1st
accused was either not actually conducting the business, or that he was not in
charge of the business. The decision of the Supreme Court, therefore, has no

received by the Local Health Authority on 15-2-1982, the prosecution was

certainly do not appreciate this delay, it is not possible to hold, in the
facts and circumstances of this case, that any prejudice has resulted to the
petitioners on that account. No such argument was also urged in the Courts
below.
