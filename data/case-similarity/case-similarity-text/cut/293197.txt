Industrises [1981] 47 STC 88. A perusal of the said judgment shows that the
question that arose here is covered by the said decision. In that case an
identical question arose and the Bench to which one of us was a party has
held, after referring to the provisions contained in section 36(3)(a)(i) and
36(3)(a)(ii) that in an appeal preferred by an assessee under section 36 the
entire assessment is set at large before the Tribunal and the Tribunal can go
into the correctness or otherwise of the order of assessment by the assessing
authority himself and not the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner
alone against which the appeal has been filed before the Tribunal and that if
it comes to the conclusion that the assessing authority has not assessed a
turnover which is liable to be assessed under the law or assessed a turnover
at a rate lower than that sanctioned by the law, it is open to the Tribunal to
set aside the order of the assessing authority and revise the assessment or
direct him to make a fresh assessment in the light of the opinion expressed by
it.
