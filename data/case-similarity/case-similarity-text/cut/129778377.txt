to adopt the trade marks, which are registered in the name of the plaintiff,
which have a worldwide market. As pointed out above, the plaintiff has failed
to establish that it had a worldwide market and the oral evidence let in by
them did not help/advance their case and the plaintiff did not take any action
for nearly 9 years i.e., from the year 1995 and as such, he has acquiesced the
conduct of the defendant.
56\. It is once again to be pointed out at this juncture that neither the oral
evidence nor the documentary evidence help/advance the case of the plaintiff
and the plaintiff has failed to probablise their case. The plaintiff, except
the self serving statement, did not adduce any quality or sufficient evidence
to sustain their claim. Therefore, the appellant/defendant is entitled to
succeed in this appeal and Question No.4 is answered accordingly.
57\. In the result, this Original Side Appeal is allowed and the judgment and
decree dated 15.12.2016 made in C.S.No.860 of 2004 is set aside and
consequently, the Suit in C.S.No.860 of 2004 is dismissed.
