settlement of the dispute. As such his presence during parley cannot be termed
unnatural. Similar was the situation as regards the presence of Kurra Ram,
brother-in-law of the deceased, who has lodged a complaint to the Panchayat.
If Kurra Ram, also accompanied the Panchayat members for the amicable
settlement of the dispute, in our view there is nothing unnatural about it.
Evidence of both the eye-witnesses stand fully corroborated by the Sarpanch
who is an independent witness. The High Court has doubted the veracity of his
evidence only on the ground that the brother of the accused once lost election
against the witness. We consider that as too feeble a ground to doubt the
evidence of the Sarpanch. The core of his testimony remains reliable and no
good reason can be traced out to reject it.
In our view the High Court relying upon some minor contradictions fell into a
clear error in passing the order of the acquittal of the accused. According to
us the learned Sessions Judge has reached the conclusion correctly and such a
well merited conviction should not have been so lightly interfered with.
