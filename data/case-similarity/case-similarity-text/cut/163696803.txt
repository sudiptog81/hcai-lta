bank shall engage in any form of business other than those referred to in sub-
section (1).
41\. Shri Shanthakumar Mahale, however, exhorted us to read Sections 6(1)(f)
and (g) as permitting the sale of goods under the trademark and/or earning
royalty from a sub-assignment thereto. We are of the view that the trademark
cannot be said to be property which has come into the possession of the bank
in satisfaction or part satisfaction of any of the claims of the bank. We are
further of the view that the trademarks are not part of any security for loans
or advances that have been made to the first respondent, or connected with the
same. It is thus clear that the assignment deed dated 8.10.2003 is clearly hit
by  60 Section 6(2) and Section 8 read with the penalty provision contained in
Section 46(4) of the Banking Regulation Act.
42\. The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the trial Court and the first
appellate Court are set aside. Consequently, O.S. No.495 of 2008 filed by
respondent No.1 will stand dismissed.
