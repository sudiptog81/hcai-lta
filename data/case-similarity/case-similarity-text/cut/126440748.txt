accounts, signing on resolution referred above dated 13.01.2005 with ante-date
prima facie, consequently, the 60 MSM,J Crl.P_1682_2013 petitioner is also
equally liable to be prosecuted for the offences punishable under Sections
120-B & 420 IPC. Hence, I find prima facie material against this petitioner to
constitute such offences punishable under Sections 120-B & 420 IPC.
Further, the offence is a serious economic fraud against the APIIC a wholly
owned State Government organization itself and it caused a dent to the
economic stability of the State. When such serious economic fraud is committed
against the State, such person has to be sternly dealt with under law (vide
State of Tamil Nadu v. R. Vasanthi Stanley21) and Ram Narayan Popli v. CBI
(referred supra).
In view of the law declared by the Apex Court in long line of judgments
referred supra and considering the allegations made in the charge-sheet alone,
since the material collected during investigation is not placed on record, I
do not find any ground to quash the proceedings at this stage and
