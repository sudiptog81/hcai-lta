28\. When the impugned order is tested on the anvil of above analysis, we are
of considered opinion that the same being contrary to the principle of law
laid down in Farooq Mohammed (supra) in respect of as to how the matter is to
be referred to a larger Bench, we set aside the order and remit the matter to
learned Single Judge. At this stage, a question arises as to whether when
apprised of the controversy qua the status of an SDO(P)/CSP/Dy. S.P., whether
this Court, in intra-court appeal, can decide the same. The answer, in our  28
WA-545-2020 considered opinion, is emphatic 'No'. That will be within the
domain of the reference Court in case of a reference made in accordance with
the law laid down in Farooq Mohammad (supra).
29\. The appeal is disposed of finally in above terms. No costs.
