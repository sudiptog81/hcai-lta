defendant is not only a subsequent registrant, but also a subsequent entrant
in the market. The prayer regarding passing off is product passing off. The
plaintiff seeks an injunction restraining second defendant from passing off
its products being Vidiem V-Star series as plaintiff's Preethi Zodiac
Series. Therefore, when these aspects are seen in conjunction with and in the
light of the narrative supra pertaining to infringement of suit design, it
follows as an inevitable sequitur that the prayer for injunction qua product
passing off also deserves to be acceded to.
5(xli) Therefore, as far as this common order is concerned, in the light of
all that have been set out supra, prayers in both applications deserve to be
acceded to and I do so.
5(xlii) Before parting with case, I deem it necessary to place on record that
the scanned reproductions in this order supra, are in black and white, but I
had the benefit of comparing them in colour. This is notwithstanding the fact
that the design registration does not include colour.
