relates to the claim of copyright of the Performing Right Society Ltd., of
London in respect of exhibition of foreign films in India, is clearly without
any substance. The law of copyright prevailing in India is applicable. The
legal position is clearly concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court in
the above mentioned case of the Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. v.
Eastern India Motion Pictures, . The Supreme Court has clearly laid down that
when a cinematograph film producer commissions a composer of music or a
lyricist for reward or valuable consideration for the purpose of making his
cinematograph film or composing music or lyric therefor i. e. the sounds for
incorporation or absorption in the sound track associated with the film, which
are included in a cinematograph film, he becomes the first owner of the
copyright therein and no copyright subsists in the composer of the lyric or
music so composed unless there is a contract to the contrary between the
composer of the lyric or music on the one hand and the producer of the
cinematograph film on the other.
