on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the
registered release deed (Ex. B-15) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding the
property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal
amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these facts, he
filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that he had
purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar.
Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the trial is
tantamount to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the
observations of the High Court that the appellants- defendants could have
easily produced the certified registered copy of Ex. B-15 and non-suited the
plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all the
documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite
party.
