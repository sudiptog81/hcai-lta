viz., that there must be the previous consent in writing by the land- lord, of
the creation of the sub-tenancy and a notice in the prescribed manner by the
sub-tenant of the creation of the sub-tenancy to the land-lord within one
month of the date of such creation.
It is only when these two conditions are satisfied that the consequences
mentioned in section 18(1) will follow. I should not, therefore, be understood
to hold the view that, as a general rule, in all cases where the sub-tenant
some- how secures the signature of the land-lord in some communication
relating to tenancy, a consent in writing satisfying the requirements of the
section is to be assumed. In this case, Messrs Om Prakash & Company and Balbir
Nath Mathur have been hand in gloves with one another to defeat the
appellants. It is the attestation by Balbir Nath Mathur on behalf of Messrs Om
Prakash & Company in the letter dated June 10, 1975, that has found favour
with us to assume consent in writing in the peculiar facts of the case. This,
according to me, is an exceptional case with facts peculiar to its own.
