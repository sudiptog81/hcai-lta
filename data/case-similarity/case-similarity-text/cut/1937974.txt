plaintiff should not be made to suffer. I do not consider that such instances
as urged by the plaintiff fall within the category of special equities carved
out as an exception to the rule in favor of encashment of bank guarantees.
Secondly, the language of the bank guarantee in question makes the defendant
as the sole judge of breach of contract and the amount to be claimed for this.
Therefore, there is no scope for any one else to consider any mitigating
circumstances. The contract provision supercedes everything. The contention of
the counsel for the plaintiff that there are special equities requiring an
injunction to the bank or the defendant restraining encashment of the bank
guarantees cannot be sustained.
(34) It follows from the above discussion that so far as the performance
guarantees are concerned, the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief and to
this extent the prayer of the plaintiff in the interim applications stands
rejected.
(35) However, the defendant is restrained from encashing the bank guarantees
