Legislature to do under our constitutional scheme. It is open to the
Legislature within certain limits to amend the provisions of an Act
retrospectively and to. declare what the law shall be deemed to have been, but
it is not open to the Legislature to say that, a judgment of a Court properly
constituted and rendered in exercise of its powers in a matter brought before
it shall be deemed to be ineffecive and the interpretation of the law shall be
otherwise than as declared by the Court.
This Court in The Amalgamated Coalfields Ltd.'s(1) case held that the cess was
not validly imposed and levied because the sanction of the State Government
was not obtained at the time of enhancing the rate of levy of tax. That
judgment was binding between the parties and also by virtue of Art. 141
binding on all Courts in the territory of India. The Legislature could not say
that that declaration of law was either erroneous, invalid or ineffective
either as a precedent or between the parties.
It is unnecessary then to consider whether the repealed Act may be amended
