3\. Rs. 1175000/- in respect of show cause notice dated 20.12.2012
4\. Rs. 57 lacs in respect of show cause notice dated 25.04.2014
18\. The grievance of department in their appeal is that the quantum of
penalty could not have been predetermined and finalized at the time of passing
of order since the penalty has to be calculated with the first date after the
due date till the date of actual payment of outstanding amount of service tax.
But the said contention is opined to be not acceptable. Above all the order
confirming demand is already set aside. The order imposing penalty of any
amount cannot sustain.
19\. In view of entire above discussion, we are of the opinion that the
adjudicating authority below has concluded the erroneous findings. Not only
this, the judicial indiscipline on the part of the authority is very much
apparent. Consequently, we hereby set aside the demand and penalties/interest
not only on the merits thereof but also for the show cause notice being not
maintainable.  14
