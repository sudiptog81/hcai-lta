article 301, which provides that trade, commerce and intercourse shall be free
throughout the territory of India. In my opinion, the view propounded by my
learned brother S. R. Das about the Actual application of the legal fiction
stops short of giving full effect to that fiction. Allied with this question
is the controversy as to whether clause (2) of article 286 is subject to
article 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation or vice versa. In my opinion, for
the reasons given by my learned brother Venkatarama Aiyar the better view is
that clause (2) of article 286 of the Constitution is subject to article
286(1)(a) read with the Explanation. On the whole, therefore, I would agree
with the view that the previous decision of this Court in 1953 S.C.R. 1069
should continue to hold good and govern the present controversy also. In that
view of the matter I would dismiss this appeal with costs.
BY THE COURT.-The appeal is allowed and an order shall be issued directing
that, until Parliament by law provides otherwise, the State of Bihar do
forbear and abstain from imposing Sales Tax on out-of State dealers in respect
