goods from the parties whose VAT/ CST registrations were cancelled. In the
absence of the assistance from the side of the assessee, we can draw an
adverse inference by holding that such amount of VAT credit relates to such
parties i.e. the registrations were cancelled. If that be so, then it is clear
that the claim was made by the assessee on account of such VAT credit for the
purchases from the parties not having valid registration number. Therefore, it
is inferred that such claim of the assessee was not bona fide in the absence
of contrary documentary evidence. Thus we not find any reason to interfere in
the order of the Ld. CIT(A). Hence, the ground of appeal of the assessee is
dismissed.
