came up for consideration was whether the words "Produced under licence from
Ameron USA" and "Marketed by Goodlass Nerolac Paints Ltd." would disentitle
the assessee for the benefit of Notification No. 175/96 for the reason that
brand name of another person was being used by the assessee. The Tribunal took
the view that it will not. Reliance was placed on an earlier decision of this
Tribunal in Nippa Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. Collector \- 1998 (100) E.L.T. 490
(T). In Dharani Cement Ltd., apart from the trade mark of the manufacturer-
assessee the packing contained the printed words "A subsidiary of Grasim
Industries Ltd." The Tribunal took the view that it would not amount to
showing the brand name or trade mark of another company.
6\. In the facts of the present case, we are of the view that the expression
"ITL" was used to convey the name of the company and not as a trade mark. It
showed that the technical know-how was obtained from Instrument Techniques
Pvt. Ltd. The expression "A quality product from ITC group" also would not
mean that the product was manufactured by Instrument Techniques Pvt. Ltd.
