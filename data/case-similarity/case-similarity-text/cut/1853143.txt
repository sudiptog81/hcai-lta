unfettered and not subject to any limit. Such power is an inherent power and
the jurisdiction vested is a set one not derived from any other statute and
such constitutionally vested right cannot be either abridged by any
legislation or abrogated or cut down.
23\. As is evident from the judgments cited by Mr. Mridul himself that the
petitioner therein had to file two successive writ petitions for getting the
judgment delivered in earlier petitioner implemented. In the instant case,
even if this Court issues the direction in exercise of its power under writ
jurisdiction, what is the guarantee that the respondents would ensure the
compliance of it and in that case, also the petitioner would have no option
but either to resort to the writ petition or to file a contempt petition.
Thus, I am of the considered opinion that the writ petition cannot be the
appropriate and effective remedy which can be entertained by the Court to
enforce its judgment. The Legislature, in its wisdom, has created a special
forum for it and the petitioner ought to have resorted to it within limitation
