criminal conspiracy are the disclosure statements of the four accused persons.
In the case of State vs. Navjot Sandhu reported in 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 16/17 reiterated that statements made by
conspirators after they are arrested cannot be brought within the ambit of
Section 10 of the Evidence Act as by that time the conspiracy would have
ended. Thus the said disclosure statements recorded after apprehension of the
accused persons cannot be relied upon to establish that the present four
accused persons were party to any criminal conspiracy. Even otherwise the said
disclosure statements are inadmissible. Hence there is no admissible material
brought by the prosecution to substantiate the charge of criminal conspiracy.
32\. For the reasons recorded above, the accused accused Abdul Karim @ Tunda @
Abdul Quddus, Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin are
discharged. All these four accused be released forthwith from judicial custody
unless required in any other case or proceedings.
