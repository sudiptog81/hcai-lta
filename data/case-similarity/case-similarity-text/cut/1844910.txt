Tribunal, in the present case, was in error in looking into the record for the
purpose of determining whether the satisfaction has been vitiated for any of
the reasons mentioned by the appellants.
40\. The learned counsel for the appellants 23 have invited our attention to
the averments contained in C.M. No. 8494 of 1980 filed on behalf of the
respondent in W.P. No. 1117-19 of 1980 in this Court in support of their
submission that the impugned orders of dismissal have been passed on the basis
of the activities referred to in para 6 of the said application. This
submission has to be, rejected in view of the finding recorded by the Tribunal
that the materials considered by the President relate to the activities of the
appellants which would prejudicially affect the security of the State and that
the said materials have nothing to do with the activities of the appellant in
relation to IBEA.
41\. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we are unable to
hold that the impugned orders for the dismissal of the appellants are vitiated
