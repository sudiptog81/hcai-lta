accounts on Arb.Appeal No. 29/2006 11 return of capital investment in view of
the arbitration clause in the agreement, cannot be challenged merely because
it is an unregistered firm. We have already held that the arbitrator has
considered the entire matter and no grounds are made out by the appellant to
set aside the award. It cannot be stated that the entire proceedings are not
maintainable. We have also seen that the award of the arbitrator is not liable
to be set aside on any of the grounds mentioned under the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. Hence, the appeal is dismissed.
