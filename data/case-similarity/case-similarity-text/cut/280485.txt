23\. If the defendants have raised any construction during the pendency of the
suit or after the decree, the executing Court without any difficulty could
order removal or the demolition of the constructions so made, but if the
superstructure was put up before the institution of the suit and was not
ordered to be removed as part of the decree, proper course in such a case
would be to direct the judgment-debtor to remove the super structure so put by
him so as to effectuate the vacant delivery of the suit site to the decree-
holder. This case has followed the earlier case of Mohd. Ismail (AIR 1970 All
648) (supra) decided by this Court. Relying on the same, an offer was given to
the judgment-debtor, but he was not prepared to remove the constructions.
24\. For the reasons given in the preceding pargraphs, I am of the view that
the order of remand passed by the revisional court was wholly uncalled for and
is not in accordance with law. It suffers from error apparent on the face of
record. The revisional court had to confine itself only to the question
whether the executing court has passed an order in consonance with the decree.
