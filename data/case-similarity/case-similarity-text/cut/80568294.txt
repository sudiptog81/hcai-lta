under Section 125 Cr.P.C. and Section 23 of the DV Act respectively. The
direction in question over steps into the legislative field, which was
impermissible for the Court to do. We agree with the view taken by the learned
Single Judge in Brijesh Kumar Gupta (supra), that there cannot be an absolute
rider that the entire maintenance amount, as granted by the Trial Court,
should be deposited prior to the entertainment of the statutory remedy,
because it would leave the remedy of statutory revision/ appeal illusory.
Accordingly, we hold that a revision under Section 399 read with Section 401
Cr.P.C. and an appeal under Section 29 of the DV Act, against the order
granting maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. and under Section 23 of the DV
Act respectively, would be maintainable, and would be entertained and heard
without any pre-condition of deposit of the arrears of maintenance as ordered
by the Ld. MM. We further hold that the pendency of such a Revision or Appeal-
as the case may be, shall not operate as a stay of the operation of the order
granting interim maintenance. The reference is answered accordingly.
