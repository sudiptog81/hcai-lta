it cannot be said that there is any intention to evade payment of duty, which
is a pre-requisite for invoking the extending period of limitation. In the
instant case also if any tax was payable it could have been available
immediately to the Appellant, thereby rendering the entire dispute being
revenue neutral. This being the case the invocation of extended period of
limitation is clearly not justified:-
a) Reliance Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (244) ELT 254 (Tri)
b) CCE vs Indios Abeis Ltd 2010 (254) ELT 628 HC Guj
c) Mafatlal Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (241) ELT 153 (T); affirmed by the Apex
Court by dismissing the Civil Appeal reported in 2010 (255) ELT A77 (SC)
d) Nirlon Ltd vs CCE 2015 (320) ELT 22 (SC)
13\. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside
with consequential relief in accordance with law.
