input manufacturer. The Honble High Court of Gujarat also in the Purity
Flexpack Ltd., (cited supra) has held the same view. Therefore, the impugned
demand holding that the appellant has not received any input service and
therefore nor eligible for any service tax credit is unsustainable in law.
Secondly, we notice that the entire demand is time barred. As early as in
2007, when the records of the appellant firm were audited by the department
the payment of royalty to Shri Kelkar and receipt of service by the appellant
was known to the department, and thereafter, on the advice of the department
Shri Kelkar obtained service tax registration and discharged service tax
liability. The receipt of service and availment to service tax credit was also
reflected by the appellant in the monthly ER-1 returns. Therefore, the whole
transaction, the payment of service tax and availment of credit thereon was in
the full knowledge of the department. In spite of having the information, the
show-cause notice has been issued in this case only in January 2011 after a
lapse of more than 3 = years. Thus, the demand is clearly time barred.
