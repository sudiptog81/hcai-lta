In the view he took on the main question of infringement of copyright the
learned Judge Ramaswami, J. did not consider it necessary to discuss the
evidence on the question of damages because be concluded that the plaintiffs-
appellants were not entitled to any damages. It is unnecessary to call for a
finding on this question because at the conclusion of the hearing of the
appeal both sides agreed that in case we found for the plaintiffs on the
question of infringement of copyright the damages to which the plaintiffs
would be entitled should be Rs. 500; accordingly we hold the plaintiffs are
entitled to recover damages Rs. 500 from the defendants.
It is not permissible for the plaintiffs-appellants to ask for an account of
the profits made by the respondents, in addition to damages for infringement
of copyright. In the result, the appeal is allowed the decree and judgment of
Ramaswami, J. are set aside and the appellants are given a decree, for
injunction in terms of Clause (a) of paragraph 15 of the plaint, and also a
decree for damages in the sum of Rs. 500 with interest at 6 per cent per annum
