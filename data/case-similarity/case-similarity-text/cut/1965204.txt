of decretal amount and costs the sale in his favour is of no significance. The
logical course for us would have been to leave Motilal to his own remedy which
we consider inequitous in the facts and circumstances of this case. The order
made by the High Court would hardly provide him Rs. 1,500 to recover which he
must have spent at the inflated rate of litigation costs. In our opinion,
while not granting the substantial relief claimed by Motilal and looking to
the conduct of all the parties, we direct that Motilal should be paid Rs.
7,500 inclusive of decretal amount, interest, proportionate costs and costs of
the litigation till today, and for this amount there will be a charge on this
property to be cleared by 226 Govindro Mahadik at the time of redemption of
the property which amount will have to be paid by Gyarasilal's heirs in view
of the sale-deed in favour of Gyarsilal.
Accordingly, Civil Appeal No. 1144/69 filed by Govindrao Mahadik is allowed
and the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the
trial court are restored with costs throughout.
