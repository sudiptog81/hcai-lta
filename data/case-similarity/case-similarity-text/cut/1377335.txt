Section 3 of the Act enacted that the provisions of Bombay Act XIV of 1939
which amended the Transfer of Property Act in its application to the pre-
reorganized State of Bombay, were extended to and shall apply to that part of
the State to which they did not apply immediately before the commencement of
that Act. Enactment of this Act was necessitated because of s. 119 of the
States Reorganization Act, 1956, which continued, notwithstanding the
formation of the new States, the territorial extent of the laws previously in
operation. It was found expedient to secure uniformity of the laws in the
State, and therefore it was enacted by the State Legislature that one of the
condi- tions of the applicability of the rule of 'Lis Pendens' was that notice
of a suit or proceeding in which any right to immoveable property within the
area notified under s. 2 of Act XIV of 1939, is directly and specifically in
question, is registered under s. 18 of the Registration Act. The decree in the
suit filed by the trustees against Maneklal was therefore enforceable against
the Company. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
