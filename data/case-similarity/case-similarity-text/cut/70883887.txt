Neither ROCA, nor ROMA has cared to adduce any evidence to assist the Court in
discerning what kind of clientale they have. Mere sales figures may not be
sufficient, in the case of tiles and other such products. Dealer networks,
price lists, evidence of consumer confusion, etc. would be needed to establish
confusion or likelihood of confusion. In the case of ROMA, the materials
suggest sales to retailers and commercial purchasers. These are insufficient
-having due regard to the period of advertisement claimed by it in the case -
to establish any kind of brand awareness or distinctiveness. For these
reasons, its claim for injunction cannot succeed.
33\. In view of the above prima facie conclusions of the Court, IA. No.
4171/2006 and I.A. No. 8136/2008 (both under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2) in CS(OS)
