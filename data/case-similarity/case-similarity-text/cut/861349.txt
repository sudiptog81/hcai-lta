has to be done, it does not cease to be horticulture. Horticulture means the
art of gardening. Admittedly, cocoanuts are raised in gardens. Gardening
requires some amount of tilling. Needless to say that every plant, whether
agricultural or horticultural, needs water. This does not make" any difference
for the consideration of the question whether a particular cultivation comes
within the category of horticulture or agriculture. In our opinion, cocoanuts
answer the definition of horticultural produce.
5\. In Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income- tax and Sales Tax v. A. P.
Raman [1960] 11 S.T.C. 263, the High Court of Kerala proceeded on the
assumption that cocoanuts are horticultural produce. It is on that footing the
further question was considered whether its fibre constituted horticultural
produce or not.
6\. The Madras High Court in The State of Madras v. R. Saravana Pillai [1956]
7 S.T.C. 541, ruled that arecanut was horticultural produce. The same
principle is contained in the case of The State of Madras, Re [1956] 7 S.T.C.
