improve the comparability. Probability of risk and certainty of risk are two
different aspects and cannot be equated for the purpose of adjustment. All
this requires robust and reliable data, both for the assessee and the
comparables in the absence of which risk adjustment cannot be considered for
enhancing comparability. Thus, the objection is dismissed."
23\. In the result, these grounds of appeal are rejected.
24\. Ground No.9, challenges the working capital adjustment of assessee vis-
a-vis comparable companies. After going through the order of the lower
authorities, this issue has not been dealt and the assessee has also not
raised this issue before the DRP, but raised before us. Therefore, this ground
is not accepted.
25\. Ground No. 10 regarding charging of interest 234B and 234C is
consequential in nature. The AO is directed to give its consequential effect.
26\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on 15th October, 2018.
