of the other party by the conduct of the one estopped. An estoppel may result
though the party estopped did not intend to lose any exist- ing right. Thus
voluntary 414 choice is the essence of waiver for which there must have
existed an opportunity for a choice between the relinquish- ment and the
conferment of the right in question. Nothing of the kind could be proved in
this case to estopp the first respondent.
In Shanti Devi v. A.K. Banerjee, [1981] 2 SCC 199, it was held that parties
could not by their pleadings alter the intrinsic character of the lease or
bring about a change of the rights and obligations flowing therefrom. The
Court would only look into the terms of the lease irrespective of the
averments in the pleadings. In the instant case as we have already held the
lease to have been for twenty years, its character could not have been changed
by the pleadings, if any, in the above cases. Nor could the respondents be
held to have waived their rights under the lease. We do not find any infirmity
in the impugned High Court order on this count also.
