In the case at hand, the High Court felt satisfied that the reason assigned by
the defendant-appellant in support of the prayer for extension of time was
good and valid. However, the prayer was denied because the High Court felt it
had no power to do so. The written statement has already been filed in the
High Court. We direct that the written statement shall now be taken on record
but subject to payment of Rs.5000/- by way of costs payable by the appellant
herein to respondent No.1 i.e. the election petitioner in the High Court,
within a period of 4 weeks from today.
The appeal stands allowed in the above terms.
No order as to the costs in this appeal.
Before parting we would like to state that the issue raised in this appeal
arises frequently before the courts and is of some significance affecting a
large number of cases, and so, in spite of the parties being represented by
learned counsel, we thought it fit to request Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, Senior
Advocate and former Additional Solicitor General of India to assist the Court
