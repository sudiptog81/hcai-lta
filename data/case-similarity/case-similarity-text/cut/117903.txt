Penal Code which is the subject matter of the complaint against Trivedi can be
said to have been committed "in relation to" those proceedings. Both the
orders resulted directly from the information lodged by Trivedi with the
police against Pathak and in this situation there is no getting out of the
conclusion that the said offence must be regarded as one committed in relation
to those proceedings. This requirement of clause (b) aforementioned is also
therefore fully satisfied.
15\. For the reasons stated, I hold that the complaint against Trivedi is in
respect of an offence alleged to have been committed in relation to a
proceeding in Court and that in taking cognizance of it the SDJM acted in
contravention of the bar contained in the said clause (b), as there was no
complaint in writing either of the SDJM or of a superior Court. In the result,
therefore, I accept the appeal and, setting aside the order of the High Court,
quash the proceedings taken by the SDJM against Trivedi.
ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the appeal is allowed,
