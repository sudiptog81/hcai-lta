advertisement was in the nature of mandatory injunction which only a Court
could issue and that ASCI could not usurp upon itself the jurisdiction of the
Court and CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 20 of 21 that the Complaint Procedure of
the ASCI could not be elevated to the status of arbitration proceedings. I
have hereinabove given my reasons for holding to the contrary and to that

22\. The plaintiff thus, by instituting this suit, cannot be permitted to
scuttle the proceedings on complaint of MRF before ASCI. Similarly the
plaintiff, by pursuing this suit cannot prevent its Advertising Agency and the
TV Channels and other medium on which the advertisement of the plaintiff is
airing from, if chose to abide by recommendation of ASCI with respect to said
advertisement, doing so. However in the event of ASCI finding merit in the
complaint and making a recommendation to the Authorised Officer, all remedies
available in law shall be open to the plaintiff.
