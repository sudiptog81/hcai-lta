interest and public policy. While dealing with the public whether by giving
job or entering into contracts or licence or any form of State largesse, the
State or its instrumentality should not adopt a decision making process to
arrive at a decision which will frustrate the beneficial schemes and
enactments floated/made by the State.
21\. Therefore, whenever the State or its instrumentality goes for execution
of any contract on turnkey basis they must see that a stipulation may be
incorporated in the tender and contract asking the successful bidder to
purchase materials necessary for execution of work contract from local rate
contract holders having ISI mark so that the interest of SSI Units and M.S.
enterprises is protected.
22\. With the aforesaid observation, the writ petitions are dismissed. No
order as to cost.
