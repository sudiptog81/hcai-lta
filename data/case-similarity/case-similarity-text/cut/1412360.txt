is received by the assessee or accrues to him as a result of the
extinguishment of the rights in the capital asset. This decision was followed
in the case of Vania Silk Mills [1977] 107 ITR 300 (Guj), also. The decision
in R.M. Amins case [1971] 82 ITR 194 (Guj), was carried to the Supreme Court,
vide [1977] 106 ITR 368, and the Supreme Court, without entering into the
question whether existence of consideration must be established to attract the
provisions of s. 45 of the Act, held that there was no transfer within the
meaning of s. 2(47) of the Act. Therefore, so far as we are concerned, in view
of the decision in R.M. Amins case which was followed in the case of Vania
Silk Mills, we must hold that in the absence of consideration, section 45
would not attracted and hence deduction by way of short-term capital loss is
not available to the assessee. We must, therefore, answer this contention also
against the assessee and in favour of the Revenue.
So far as the expenditure of Rs. 20,40,000 is concerned, the same has been
allowed as revenue expenditure by the decision of this court in CIT v. Gujarat
