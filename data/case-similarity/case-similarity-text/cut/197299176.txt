only the aggrieved party may approach the Civil Court if there was violation
of fundamental judicial procedure or if process of law was abused by the
statutory forum/Tribunal or that it acted in violation of the provisions of
the Statute. This being the position, if, in view of averment in the plaint,
the plaintiffs have statutory remedy, the plaintiffs must first approach the
statutory forum for an order of injunctive reliefs available under the Statute
against the respondents including the Bank concerned.
Scheme and Object/purport of the SARFAESI Act leads us to the above
conclusion. Hence, no interference is required in the impugned judgments and
orders in the facts and circumstances of the case. The substantial question is
answered accordingly.
