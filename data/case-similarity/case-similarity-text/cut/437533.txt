subsequent thereto any harassment was made by the appellant with a view to
coercing her or any person related to Respondent No. 2 to meet any unlawful
demand or any property.
25\. In that view of the matter neither explanation (a) nor explanation (b) of
Section 498 A of IPC is attracted in the present case. It is crystal clear
that  19 neither in the FIR nor in the charge sheet there is any ingredient of
Section 498A IPC, which could prima facie constitute a case of cruelty as
defined in that Section.
26\. It is thus established that on a reading of the FIR as also the charge
sheet filed against the appellant no case under Section 498A is made out on
the face of the record, and therefore, both the FIR as also the charge sheet
are liable to be quashed in exercise of the powers under Section 482 of the
CrPC. Clearly, the High Court failed to appreciate the facts in proper
perspective, and therefore, committed an error on the face of the record.
27\. We, therefore, allow this appeal and quash the proceedings initiated
