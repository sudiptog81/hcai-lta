of the defendant appellant. However, if the suit ultimately fails, the harm
caused to the defendant appellant would be irreparable as it would be
difficult to compute the compensation. The balance of convenience was against
the passing of interim orders as prayed for in the petition.
For the reasons discussed above, the appeals are allowed and the impugned
judgment dated 1.3.2018 is set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
