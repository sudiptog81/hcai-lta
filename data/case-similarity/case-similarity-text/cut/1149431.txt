abducted person to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. It cannot,
however, be said that the entire Act is 'ultra vires' for its remaining
provisions are in no way inconsistent with Article 22. Had the Act provided

quasi-judicial functions for it makes ah enquiry into the status of an
individual, it is subject to the supervision of this Court,

Act; so orders passed by it were without jurisdiction.
157\. In the result all the abducted persons whose relatives or
representatives have moved this Court for writs of 'habeas corpus' are
entitled to be set at liberty forthwith.
