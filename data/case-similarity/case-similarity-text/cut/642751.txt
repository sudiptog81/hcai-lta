in Class 7 ought to be allowed.
21\. This Court also holds that there is no legal infirmity in the order of
the IPAB which dismissed the cancellation petition of UB for the grant of
registration in favour of AU for electrical flat iron in Class 9. The
cancellation petition is barred both by laches and acquiescence. The mark
'UNITED' is a weak one and the registrations already granted to the respective
parties can be allowed to continue on account of the long number of years
during which both AU and UB have used the mark for their respective goods
without there being deception and confusion in the minds of the consumers as
regards the origin of their respective goods i.e. electric flat irons and
pressure cookers.
22\. In the circumstances, neither the order dated 3rd December, 2004 passed
by the IPAB dismissing UB's application No. TRA No. 92/2004/TM/DEL (CO. No.
6/96) nor the order dated 28th January, 2010 of the IPAB dismissing the appeal
filed by AU TRA/177/2003/TM/DEL W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 16 of 17
