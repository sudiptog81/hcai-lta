leave is not obtained, the altered trade mark cannot be made use of. No doubt,
Kerly says in his book in paragraphs 15-41 at page 310 that the variation in
one's registered mark, provided it is not an infringement of any other
person's mark or a breach of any agreement binding upon him, is perfectly
lawful, although, so far as the mark actually used differs substantially from
his registered mark, it is an unregistered mark. But Kerly also adds therein
that it is well settled that the use of a varied mark by the plaintiff does
not in any way stop him from proceeding against infringers. In this
connection, the decisions cited by the learned counsel for the appellant,
viz., Cluet Peabbdy & Co. Inc. v. Mcintyre Hogg Marsh & Co. Ltd., (1958) 75
RPC 335. In the matter of British Hoist & Crane Coy. Ltd.'s Trade Mark, (1955)
RPC 66; Eli Lilly & Co. Ltd. v. Chelsea Drug Chemical Co. Ltd., (1966) RPC 14
and Otrivin Trade Mark, (1967) RPC 613, which very much turned on the facts of
the said respective cases, could not be taken as precedents at this
interlocutory stage.
