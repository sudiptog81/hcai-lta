Facts of this case as noted and detailed supra do not make out any such
allegation of fraud. Record shows that the name of the petitioner was never
entered into the register of members as a holder of 52470 shares; his own case
is that the share transfer forms were available with him in 1998; he however
took no steps to get himself on to the register of members; fault was entirely
of the petitioner; he thus not being a member on the register of members of
the Company; when the notices were issued by the Chairperson 23.03.1999 for
the proposed meeting of the merger of Tony Electronics with Super Cassette
Industries. Further qua the 100 shares, the same had already been sold to
Bhushan Dua on CA No. 730/2002 in CP No.167/1999 Page 36 of 37 27.02.1999. As
such no rights had accrued in his favour qua the company which would have
entitled him to a notice of the meeting in his capacity as a member.
44 Objections raised by the petitioner are wholly without any merit. They are
accordingly dismissed. The pending applications have also become infructuous.
They are disposed of accordingly.
