Union of India v. Naveen Jindal [(2004) 2 SCC 510].
11\. In the State emblem of the Government of Tamil Nadu, the national flag
finds a prominent place. Insofar as the stand taken by the petitioner/party-
in-person that the ratio of length and breadth to the width of the flag has
been violated in the State emblem, this Court is of the considered view that
it is applicable if the national flag is displayed. This Court is also of the
view that respect and dignity of the national flag has been preserved in the
State emblem and therefore, it cannot be said that the said display is against
the provisions of the above said Act and the Flag Code.
12\. This Court finds no merit in this writ petition and hence, it is
dismissed. However, in the circumstances of the case, there shall be no order
as to costs.
