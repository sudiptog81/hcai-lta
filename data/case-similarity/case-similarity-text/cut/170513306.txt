being currently probed/investigated by DRI. What is expressed in this para-29
above is purely our personal views based on the events and circumstances
presented before us.
30\. In view of the foregoing discussions and our findings as above, we set
aside both the Order-in-Original and the impugned order-in-appeal and remand
the matter to the original authority with a direction to examine the issue
afresh in the light of our findings contained in this order and to proceed to
determine the issue. The original authority is also directed to take into
consideration the outcome of the investigation proceedings initiated by D.R.I
while deciding the issue.
31\. In the result, the Revenue appeal is allowed by way of remand in the
above terms. Stay application filed by Revenue also gets disposed. This order
is subject to the outcome of two writ petitions pending before the Hon'ble
High Court of Madras.
