This common judgment will dispose of these appeals and cross-appeals by the
assessee and the Revenue in which one of the primary issue that emanates for
consideration is whether advertisement, marketing and sale promotion
expenditure (‗AMP', for short) beyond and exceeding the ‗bright line' is a
separate and independent international transaction undertaken by the resident
Indian assessee towards brand building for the brand owner, i.e. the foreign
Associated Enterprise (‗AE', for short). Other core issues pertain to aspects
of arm's length pricing of international transactions.

The common substantial questions of law which are required to be dealt with in
the appeals by the assessee read:

A. Background facts and assessments

3\. The assessed are subsidiaries of the foreign AEs. The assessed and the
foreign AEs are all members of Multi-National Enterprises (‗MNE', for short).
During the relevant period, the assessed were engaged in distribution and
marketing of imported and branded products, manufactured and sold to them by
the foreign AEs resident abroad. Intangible rights in the brand-name/
trademark/ trade-name were owned by the foreign AEs. There is no dispute or
lis that the assessed are AEs who had entered into controlled transactions
with the foreign AEs. It is also uncontested that the controlled international
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 8 of 142 transactions can be made subject
matter of the transfer pricing adjustment in terms of Chapter X of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 (‗Act', for short).

4\. In order to appreciate the controversy, we are reproducing in brief the
findings of the Assessing Officer/TPO and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(‗Tribunal', for short) in the case of Sony Mobile Communication Ltd, i.e. the
assessee/appellant in ITA No.16/2014 and the assessee/respondent in ITA
No.155/2014 filed by the Revenue pertaining to assessment year 2008-09; Reebok
India Company Ltd., i.e. the assessee/appellant in ITA No.109/2014 and the
assessee/respondent in ITA No.213/2014 filed by the Revenue relating to
assessing year 2008-09; and, Canon India Pvt. Ltd., i.e. the appellant in ITA
No.512/2013 and respondent in ITA No.12/2014 filed by the Revenue relating to
assessment year 2006-07. The said three assessees have been selected because
in the case of Sony Mobile Communication Pvt. Ltd., Transactional Net Margin
Method (‗TNM Method', for short) has been followed and in the case of Reebok
India Company Ltd., TNM Method has been followed in respect of goods' sourcing
and exports from India; Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (‗CUP Method',
for short) has been followed in respect of royalty paid by the Indian AE to
the foreign AE and in respect of which separate substantial question of law
has been framed and Resale Price Method (‗RP Method', for short) has been
followed for import of apparels and footwear for re-sale. In the case of Canon
India Pvt. Ltd., RP Method was adopted by the assessee for import of finished
goods for resale. In the said case, the order passed by TPO is detailed and is
a lucid exposition of the stand of the Revenue.

SONY MOBILE COMMUNICATION PVT.LTD.

ITA No.16/2014 (By the Assessee) and ITA No.155/2014 (By the Revenue)
Assessment year 2008-09 ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 9 of 142

5\. The assessed was a subsidiary of a Sweden based entity, ‗Sony Ericsson
Mobile Communications AB', a 50:50 joint venture of Sony Corporation (Japan)
and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Sweden). The assessed was engaged in
importing/buying and selling, and distribution, promotion and marketing of
mobile handsets under the brand name ‗Sony Ericsson', and providing post sale
support/warranty services in India. The assessee in the transfer pricing
report accepted that the group companies, i.e. the AEs, owned significant and
valuable intellectual property rights in commercial or marketing intangibles
in the form of brand-name, trademark, logos, etc. but the assessed did not own
any significant or valuable non-routine intangibles. The assessed was
primarily an importer performing distribution and marketing functions by
reselling the imported handsets with its primary functions being sales,
budgeting, inventory scheduling, marketing including advertisements and sale
promotions, creating distribution channels, and servicing warranty claims.

6\. As per the transfer pricing report, the assessed had declared net profit
margin of 2.5% which was better than the average or mean of 18 comparables
(wrongly mentioned as 19). The assessee had applied the TNM Method for
computing the arm's length price and the Profit Level Indicator (‗PLI', for
short) adopted was total turnover, in proportion to the net profit rate. While
computing the net profit, the assessee had included credit notes worth
Rs.73,83,70,409/- received from the overseas/foreign AEs in December, 2007 and
March, 2008.

7\. The TPO held that Rs.73,83,70,409/- represented excess price charged by
the AE and were issued to achieve the arm's length return in accordance with
the business model of the assessee. He observed that the total AMP expenditure
of Rs.115,72,15,159/- on gross sales of Rs.1,638,68,08,123/- gave AMP to sales
ratio of 7.06%. Business promotion and selling expenses of Rs.49,66,58,381/-

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 10 of 142

were included and added to arrive at the figure of AMP expenses of
Rs.115,72,15,159/-. Out of the 18 comparables suggested by the assessee, the
TPO accepted 12 and rejected 6 for they were involved in brand promotion
activities being the owners of the brand-name or the intangibles. The mean AMP
to sales ratio of the 12 comparables was 3.35%. This figure of 3.35% was
treated as the ‗bright line' and accordingly the AMP expenditure, exceeding
the said ratio was treated as non-routine or abnormal. Thus, Rs.60,82,57,087/-
was treated as abnormal or excessive AMP expenditure. To this, the TPO added a
mark-up of 15%. Rs.73,83,70,409/- received as credit notes was not set off
against the AMP expenses. The TPO made the following computation:-

    
    
                             Computation of TP adjustment                    In Rs.

                             AMP/Sales of Comparables                       3.35%
                             Amount that represents bright line        548,958,072
                             Expenditure on AMP by assessee          1,157,215,159
                             Expenditure in excess of bright line      608,257,087
                             Mark-up at 15%                             91,238,563
                             Reimbursement that assessee should        699,495,650
                             have received
                             Reimbursement actually received                 NIL
                             Adjustment to assessee's income          699,495,650
    
    
    

8\. The Dispute Resolution Panel (‗DRP', for short) substantially rejected the
assessee's objections but reduced the mark up from 15% to 12.5% observing it
to be the reasonable mark-up.

9\. The Tribunal in the impugned order dated 30th August, 2013, observed that
the Function, Asset and Risk analysis (‗FAR analysis', for short) of the
assessee and the comparables was not disputed by the TPO and hence accepted.
The ‗bright line test' ratio of 3.35% as applied on recalculation would be
4.02%, considering the partial relief granted by the DRP in excluding 2
comparables. Thus, the abnormal or non-routine AMP expenditure would be to the
extent of 3.04% (7.06 - 4.02). Further, quantum of the AMP expenses computed
by the TPO/ Revenue required re-computation in terms of the decision dated 23
rd ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 11 of 142 January, 2013 of the Special
Bench of the Tribunal, in L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. versus Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, reported as (2013) 152 TTJ 273 (Del). Further, the
mark up of 12.5% as sustained by the DRP, was not based upon any comparable.
Lastly, failure to account for Rs.73,83,70,409/- in the form of credit notes
was not elucidated and explained by the Revenue. Accordingly, an order of
remand was passed.

REEBOK INDIA CO. LTD.

ITA No.109/2014 (by the assessee) and ITA No.213/2014 (by the Revenue)
Assessment Year 2008-09

10\. The assessee belongs to ‗Adidas Group', stated to be a global leader in
sportswear goods' industry with broad portfolio of products. The group has
approximately 100 subsidiaries and office of the parent company is located in
Germany with key corporate units in the United States of America.

11\. The assessed Reebok India Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 1995 as a joint
venture between Reebok Mauritius and Focus Energy Ltd., India. As per the
details furnished by the assessee, they had entered into the following
international transactions:

> ― S. No. Nature of Transaction Method used by Amount assessee

> 1\. Import of apparels and footwear RPM 34,75,63,922 for resale

> 2\. Royalty CUP 15,28,77,527

> 3\. Identification of factories in India TNMM 73,87,878 for
> sourcing/exporting the goods ‖ The aforesaid table also gives details of
> method adopted by the assessee. The assessee had received reimbursement of
> advertisement and other expenses to the tune of Rs.44,67,273/- from the AE.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 12 of 142

12\. In the appeals, we are concerned with the international transaction at
Sl. No.1, i.e. import of apparels and footwear for resale in India.
Transaction No.2 also arises for consideration, but has been examined
separately. The assessee had adopted RP Method for arm's length determination
of transaction No.1. The gross margin earned and declared by the assessed from
controlled transactions was 42.95%, compared to 42.52% earned from internal
comparables, i.e. transactions of the assessed with unrelated parties. Thus,
it was claimed that the price of uncontrolled transaction was at arm's length.

13\. The TPO quoted and relied on the clauses of the agreement dated 1st
March, 1995, with Reebok International Ltd., England, to highlight that the
functions of the Indian AE were to promote and develop the market for selling
and distributing the Reebok branded products in India and to support and
cooperate in execution of global marketing plans and strategies. Referring the
OECD's report on transfer pricing guidelines from Multi-national Enterprises
and Tax Administrations, paragraphs 6.4 and 6.36 to 6.39, the TPO observed
that when a distributor bears the cost of ―extraordinary‖ marketing
activities, he should be compensated with return on the intangible created
because of such expenditure. Distinction between short-term and long-term
relationship was highlighted. He referred to Australian Tax Code as well as
the U.S. IRS Regulations. He held that in the OECD Guidelines and as per
international tax practices and jurisprudence, the ‗bright line test' was an
acknowledged and accepted tool to determine and ascertain routine and non-
routine AMP expenses. He made reference to the cases of DHL and
GlaxoSmithKline. Relying on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. versus Addl. CIT/TPO [2010] 328 ITR 210 (Del), he held that
the assessed was engaged in brand promotion by incurring AMP expenses. He made
reference to the following table:

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 13 of 142

> F.Ys. 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 Sales (WSP)

> Reimbursement of 11.54% 7.14% 5.66% 3.6% 16.06% 18.75% 0.27% AMP/ AMP Gross

14\. TPO observed that AMP expenditure had increased significantly as
percentage of sale. Further, the assessee had offered discounts in the form of
growth incentive scheme and business volume discount scheme. These expenses
were not linked with advertisement functions, but they had worked to enhance
the brand value by popularizing the use of the product through discount and
attractive offers, creating familiarity and market for the products. Thus, the
said expenditure should be added to AMP expenses. Accordingly,
Rs.16,61,12,065/- on account of selling and distribution was added to the
advertisement and publicity expenditure of Rs.39,01,24,915/- to reach a figure
of Rs.55,62,36,980/-, which gave the ratio of AMP to sales of 12.33%.

15\. On the question of ‗bright line' comparables, the TPO rejected companies
like Colgate India Ltd., Dabur India Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare
Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Marico Ltd., Trent Ltd., and Emami Ltd., with
the ratio of AMP to sales of Rs.12.52%, observing that these companies were
engaged in promotion of their own name and the AMP expenses incurred by them
were non-routine. Another list of five comparables was rejected on different
grounds. This list included Khadim India Ltd. and Liberty Retail Revolutions
Ltd. engaged in similar business of footwear.

16\. The TPO adopted the following comparables for bright line limit:

                    S.No. Name of the Company                   AMP Expenses/sales
                                                                     (%)
                   1.      Bhartiya Global Marketing Ltd.            2.15
                   2.      Globus Stores Pvt. Ltd.                   4.66
                   3.      Pokarna Fashions Ltd.                     1.49
                   4.      Snowhite Apparels Ltd.                    1.72

17\. On this base/ratio of 2.51% of AMP to sales, excess or disproportionate
AMP expenses in the case of the assessed were calculated as under:

    
    
                  ―Value of Gross Sales                  451,23,49,038/-
                  AMP/Sales of comparables                        2.51%
                  Amount that represent bright line        11,32,59,961/-
                  Expenditure on AMP by assessee          55,62,36,980/-
                  Expenditure in excess of brightline     44,29,77,019/-‖
    
    
    

18\. The TPO held that the assessee was reimbursed Rs.11,43,021/- for the
aforesaid non-routine AMP activities and was entitled to re-imbursement for
the entire expenditure, plus mark-up of 15% which he considered to be
reasonable as it took care of the interest costs which the assessee had to
bear on the money invested in developing and marketing intangibles.
Accordingly, total upward adjustment of Rs.66,11,58,078/- was suggested.

19\. The DRP substantially rejected the objections of the assessee except that
they reduced the mark up to 12.50%, and consequently reduced the adjustment to
Rs.49,72,06,162/-.

20\. The Tribunal in the impugned order has referred to the bifurcation of
selling and distribution expenditure of Rs.1,66,12,066/- which is as under:

25\. The TPO held that the assessee had incurred AMP expenses totalling
Rs.37,88,97,359/-, or 12.08% of the total sales, whereas subsidy of
Rs.12,10,48,124/- was received. Thus, balance expenditure of Rs.25,78,49,235/-
was borne by the assessee. The assessee had failed to bench mark international
transaction of Rs.12,10,48,124/-. He rejected the argument of the assessee
that the subsidy was to lend financial support and this support was akin to
discount and reduction of sale price, relying on the written submission of the
assessee, bifurcating the subsidy in the following manner:

But the profit margin of Canon Inc., Japan was substantial higher and was as
under:

    
    
                             F.Y.         2001- 02   2002- 03   2003- 04   2004- 05    2005-06

                   Inc. Japan (AE) *
    
    
    

*the profit margins of the Canon as mentioned in the table pertain to year 2001,2002,2003,2004 and 2005 as extracted from Orbis database.‖ 

27\. He did a comparison between percentage of AMP to gross sales of the
Indian AE, i.e. the assessee and the profits margin of Canon Inc., Japan to
observe that there was a co-relation between increase in the profit margin of
the parent AE and the enhanced AMP of the Indian AE and there was a negative
co-relation between the profitability of the Indian AE and the AMP expenditure
incurred by Indian AE.

28\. The TPO thus recorded that the Indian AE had borne significant costs and
risk associated with development of AE's trademark in India. The assessed was
entitled to retain associated intangible income. In order to compute the non-
routine or excessive AMP, the TPO adopted the following steps or procedure:

> "Step 1: first step is to determine AMP expenditure of the assessee, Step 2:
> selection of comparables for determining bright line limit, out of the list
> of finally selected comparable by the assessee in its transfer pricing
> report for benchmarking of International transaction of purchase of Canon
> product from AE using RPM. In the selection x. process, each comparable was
> examined to ascertain whether these comparables are routine distributor or
> engaged in brand promotion and development of marketing intangible for the
> related party or itself being owner of brand trademark. After this analysis
> only those comparable which are engaged in routine distribution business and
> are not carrying out of non routine activities like trade mark promotion and
> development of marketing intangible are selected.

> Step 3: to determine AMP expenditure of the comparables finally selected for
> benchmarking of international transaction of subsidy.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 21 of 142

> Step 4: the ratios of AMP. expenditure to the sales of uncontrolled
> comparables (routine distributors) were taken as comparable uncontrolled
> price which were compared with the ratio of AMP expenditure to the sales in
> the case of the assessee to determine bright line limit as discussed in
> paragraph 7.5 and 7.6 of this order.

> Step 5: the AMP expenditure of the assessee which was in excess of bright
> line limit determined on the basis of comparable uncontrolled AMP prices was
> held as arm's length price of-the subsidy."

29\. Accordingly, the TPO observed that the total AMP expenditure of
Rs.37,88,97,359/-, inclusive of discount and volume rebate of
Rs.16,07,59,162/- gave a percentage of AMP expenditure to total turnover, of
12.08%. For the purpose of comparables, TPO rejected the comparables adopted
by the assessee to benchmark the international transaction for purpose of non-
routine AMP expenses, recording:-

30\. He observed that profile of Spice Systems Ltd. and Xerox India Ltd.
should not be included in the comparables for that they were engaged in non-
routine functions like development of marketing intangibles. The remaining 5,
engaged in routine functions, should be selected for applying the ‗bright

AMP expenses to sales, was computed at 1.434% as per the following table.

33\. The DRP upheld the suggested transfer pricing adjustment.

34\. The Tribunal in the impugned order has observed that following the
majority judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra), the legal
grounds should be decided against the assessee. On the question of nature and
scope of AMP expenditure, as elucidated by the majority judgment in L.G.
Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra), it was held that the sale related
expenses, i.e. trade discount, volume rebate, cash discount, commission etc.
should be excluded. To this extent, the appeal filed by the assessee was
allowed for statistical purpose, directing that there was no justification for
setting aside the expenses for verification again to the Assessing
Officer/TPO. The details of the subsidy, trade and volume discount, cash
discount and commissions as quantified were:-

36\. Subject to the aforesaid, an order of remand was passed to apply and
determine the arm's length price of the AMP expenses by applying the ratio of
the majority judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra).

B. L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. versus CIT

37\. In the impugned orders, the Tribunal has primarily relied upon and
followed the majority judgment of the Special Bench of the Tribunal in L.G.

Electronics India Pvt Ltd (supra). Learned counsels for the parties have
extensively referred to both majority and minority judgment in their erudite
and pensive arguments. The decision of the Special Bench in L.G. Electronics
India Pvt Ltd. (supra) has not yet been made a subject matter of challenge
before the High Court by both the assessee therein and the Revenue, for the
said appeal is still pending before the Tribunal and has not yet been finally
decided.

However, as the issue is a recurring one, arising in significant number of
cases with substantial tax effect and even the Revenue is aggrieved by certain
portions of the said decision, it would not be appropriate and proper to
adjourn these ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 25 of 142 appeals to await
filing of appeal/cross-appeal in the case of L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd.
(supra). Both sides have pressed for immediate hearing.

38\. The majority judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra) had
reached the following findings:-

(i) In terms of the Sub-Section 2B to Section 92CA, a TPO could have examined
and applied transfer pricing provisions to a transaction, which comes to his
notice, in respect of which the assessee has not furnished a report under
Section 92E of the Act. Amendment by the Finance Act, 2012 incorporating Sub-
Section 2B to Section 92CA was retrospective and applicable with effect from
1st June, 2002. Thus, the TPO could have examined the unreported international
transaction relating to the AMP expenses.

(ii) AMP was an international transaction, given the contours and ambit of the
term ‗transaction' and ‗international transaction' as defined in the Act.

(iii) The said character as an international transaction cannot be denied or
negated because AMP expenditure was incurred in India and was paid by the
assessed to independent parties in India.

(iv) The contention that there was no express agreement apropos brand building
for incurring AMP expenses was rejected, holding that such agreement or
understanding could be inferred and could also be oral. Reference was made to
the definition of the terms ‗transaction' and ‗international transaction'
including the retrospective insertions made by the Finance Act, 2012, to
explain the two terms.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 26 of 142

(v) The TPO was entitled to re-categorize any transaction; (i) where the
economic substance of the transaction differs from its form; (ii) where the
form and substance of the transaction are the same, but the arrangements made
in relation to the transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from
those which would have been adopted by an independent enterprise behaving in a
commercially rational manner. Relying upon the decision of the Delhi High
Court in CIT versus EKL Appliances Ltd. [2012] 345 ITR 241 (Del), which refers
to the OECD Commentary carving out the two exceptions, it has been held that
the second exception was applicable. Thus, the TPO could have re-categorized
the international transaction as declared to determine arm's length price of
the unravelled and deciphered international transaction as per the mandate of
Section 92CA(2B) of the Act.

(vi) In order to determine and decide whether an assessed had an AMP
international transaction with an AE, the TPO could rely upon the ‗bright line
test', both to determine and re-categorize the international transaction, and
to compute the contractual value or the price of the said transaction.
Application of the ‗bright line test' was not contrary to the Act, i.e. the
Income Tax Act, 1961.

(vii) Application of the ‗bright line test' was only to segregate the AMP
expenses incurred by an assessee for their own business and compute the value
or cost of the AMP expenses incurred by the assessee for promoting brand value
of the AE, resident abroad.

(viii) ‗Bright line test' does not require statutory endorsement.

(ix) On application of the ‗bright line test', if it is ascertained and
deduced that the assessed had incurred non-routine AMP expenses beyond what a
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 27 of 142 similarly situated independent,
non-brand owner Indian distributor would have incurred under the
circumstances, this quantum of difference or excessive expenditure should be
treated as an independent international transaction of brand building for the
foreign AE, the owner of the said trademark or brand.

(x) The Tribunal did not approve of the benchmarks or the comparables adopted
by the TPO to apply the ‗bright line test'. The said test should be applied by
comparative analysis of comparable uncontrolled cases which should be really
comparable, i.e. the comparable must deal with the same genus of products;
have comparable market share; and the assets employed; the functions performed
and the risks assumed should be similar. Paragraph 17.2 reads:

> ―17.2. We find that the first step in making comparability analysis, is to
> find out some comparable uncontrolled cases. It goes without saying that a
> comparison can be made with the cases which are really comparable. A case is
> said to be comparable when it is from the same genus of products and also
> other relevant factors, such as, type of products, market share, assets
> employed, functions performed and risks assumed, are also similar. Once
> proper comparable cases are chosen, then the next step is to neutralize the
> effect of the differences in relevant facts of the case to be compared and
> the assessee's case, by making suitable plus or minus adjustments.‖

> (xi) The Tribunal enumerated 14 criteria/parameters for selection of
> comparables for applying the ‗bright line test' and determination of the
> cost/value of the international transaction of brand/logo promotion by
> incurring AMP expenses by an Indian AE, for its foreign AE. The 14 point

> advertising, marketing and promotion expenses incurred by the Indian

> 1\. Whether, the Indian associated enterprise is simply a distributor or is

> 2\. Where the Indian associated enterprise is not a full-fledged

> 3\. Whether, the goods sold by the Indian associated enterprise bear the
> same brand name or logo which is that of its foreign associated enterprise?

> 4\. Whether, the goods sold bear logo only of foreign associated enterprise
> or a logo which is only of the Indian associated enterprise or is it a joint
> logo of both the Indian entity and its foreign counterpart?

> 5\. Whether, the Indian associated enterprise, a manufacturer, is paying any
> royalty or any similar amount by whatever name called to its foreign

> its foreign associated enterprise?

> 6\. Whether, the payment made as royalty to the foreign associated
> enterprise is comparable with what other domestic entities pay to
> independent foreign parties in a similar situation?

> 7\. Where the Indian associated enterprise has got a manufacturing licence
> from the foreign associated enterprise, is it also using any technology or
> technical input or technical know-how acquired from its foreign associated
> enterprise for the purposes of manufacturing such goods?

> 8\. Where the Indian associated enterprise is using technical know-how
> received from the foreign associated enterprise and is paying any amount to
> the foreign associated enterprise, whether the payment is only towards fees
> for technical services or includes royalty part for the use of brand name or
> brand logo also?

> 9\. Whether the foreign associated enterprise is compensating the Indian
> entity for the promotion of its brand in any form, such as subsidy on the
> goods sold to the Indian associated enterprise?

> 10\. Where such subsidy is allowed by the foreign associated enterprise,
> whether the amount of subsidy is commensurate with the expenses incurred by
> the Indian entity on the promotion of brand for the foreign associated
> enterprise?

> 11\. Whether, the foreign associated enterprise has its presence in India
> only in one field or different fields ? Where it is involved in different
> fields, then is ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 29 of 142 there only
> one Indian entity looking after all the fields or there are different Indian
> associated enterprises for different fields ? If there are different
> entities in India, then what is the pattern of advertising, marketing and
> promotion expenses in the other Indian entities?

> 12\. Whether the year under consideration is the entry level of the foreign
> associated enterprise in India or is it a case of established brand in
> India?

> 13\. Whether any new products are launched in India during the relevant
> period or is it continuation of the business with the existing range of
> products?

> 14\. How the brand will be dealt with after the termination of agreement
> between associated enterprises?‖

> (xii) The contention of the assessee that comparable cases would be those
> using foreign brand was expressly rejected in paragraph 17.6. The Tribunal
> rejected the contention of the assessee that they were economic owners of
> the brand and in commercial sense their right in the brand name / trademark

> products do not become economic owners of the branded products sold by them.
> Paragraph 17.6 reads:

> ―17.6. In principle, we accept the contention of the ld. AR about the
> necessity of choosing properly comparable cases in the first instance before
> starting the exercise of making comparison of the AMP expenses incurred by
> them for finding out the amount spent by the assessee for its own business
> purpose. However the way in which such comparable cases should be chosen, as
> advocated by the ld. AR, is not acceptable. He submitted that only such
> comparable cases should be chosen as are using the foreign brand. We find

> & connected matters Page 30 of 142 given to the relevant factors as
> discussed above, it will correctly reflect the cost/value of international
> transaction.‖

> (xiii) Contention of the assessee that TNM Method required comparison of
> overall net profit of the assessee with the comparables, was rejected for
> the following reasons:

(a) The TNM Method postulated in the Rule 10B(1)(e) of the Income Tax Rules,
1962 (‗Rules', for short) stipulates benchmarking of ―a‖ transaction in
singular as defined in Rule 10A(d). TNM Method would relate to profit margin
of ―a‖ transaction and not net profit of an entity or total sales of the
entity. It is a transaction and not an entity based method.

(b) Scrutiny of Chapter X of the Act and language of Section 92(3) mandates
and sanctions that TNM Method would be applied only on a transactional level
and not at the entity level.

(c) Bunching of international transactions was not permissible and each
international transaction has to be separately valued and accordingly arm's
length price computed. Each transaction should be taken as an independent
transaction, for computing arm's length price.

(d) Profit of an entity would depend upon several factors which contribute in
earning of profits. Thus, costs of AMP expenses were independent of cost of
raw material/products.

(e) The factum that the assessed had declared an overall higher profit rate in
comparison with the comparables was insufficient and sparse. It was certainly
not a licence to the assessed to not record the AMP expenses as an
international transaction. Benefit, service or facility furnished and provided
to the AE resident abroad required compensation at arm's length price.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 31 of 142

(xiv) The argument that expenditure incurred on AMP was subsumed and included
in the value of the international transaction already disclosed and paid for
by the foreign AE, was rejected for there could be no reason or ground for
such assumption.

(xv) The argument of the assessed that under the TNM Method, the net profit of
the entity includes the effect of transactions subject matter of arm's length
price between the two AEs, was also rejected on the ground that the effect of
five methods prescribed under Chapter X was towards one end, i.e.
determination of arm's length price of an international transaction and
consequences of each method qua the international transaction cannot be at
variance. Thus, TNM Method should not be applied at entity level.

(xvi) The contention of the assessed that set off or adjustment of
‗excessive'/‗higher' net profit declared on international transactions should
be allowed, if the AMP expenses were treated as a separate international
transaction, was rejected, relying upon Section 92(3) of the Act. Set off or
adjustments cannot be allowed in respect of profits and gains of one
international transaction against another international transaction.

(xvii) The Assessing Officer/ TPO without specific reference had in substance
applied the Cost Plus Method (‗CP Method', for short) for computing the arm's
length price of the international transaction, i.e. the AMP transaction
between the AE resident abroad and the Indian assessed. The CP Method was one
of the methods prescribed in Chapter X of the Act.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 32 of 142

(xviii) Mark-up is mandated under the CP Method. The mark-up had not been
correctly computed with reference to comparables and, therefore, determination
of quantum of mark-up required remand.

(xix) The matter also required remand as the TPO, while applying the ‗bright
line test' and computing the arm's length value or price of the AMP expenses,
had not selected appropriate comparables as per the criteria stipulated in
paragraph 17.4 of the majority decision.

(xx) Effect of the order passed by the Supreme Court, reported as Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. versus Addl. CIT, [2011] 335 ITR 121 (SC) on the
reasons/ratio expounded by the Delhi High Court in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
(supra), was analysed, to hold that the decision of the High Court was not
entirely overruled and the ratio decidendi of the Delhi High Court judgment on
the question of incurring of the AMP expenditure by the Indian AE, whether it
benefits the foreign AE, requirement to compensate the Indian AEs and other
legal principles enrolled, were binding. What had been set aside by the
Supreme Court were the observations on merits relating to facts, and not law.
The legal principles enunciated by the High Court in Maruti Suzuki (supra)
were not expressly or impliedly overruled.

(xxi) AMP expenses would not include direct selling costs like trade or volume
discounts, incentives etc. Direct marketing and sale related expenses or
discounts/concessions would not form part of the AMP expenses.

(xxii) Section 37(1) of the Act and the arm's length proceedings under Chapter
X of the Act, operate independently. The AMP expenses, allowable as
expenditure under Section 37(1) of the Act, would not affect determination of
the arm's length price of an international transaction or ITA 16/2014 &
connected matters Page 33 of 142 income of the Indian assessee who has to pay
tax in India. Accordingly, the TPO was entitled to make adjustment and compute
the arm's length price, notwithstanding the legal position that AMP expenses
were deductible under Section 37(1) of the Act. Determination and, if
required, adjustment of the arm's length price is the mandate under Chapter X
of the Act.

39\. We are not at this stage referring to the minority decision, though we
will be referring to certain portions of the said decision when we take up and
answer the issues on merits.

40\. At the outset, we would like to begin our reasoning and decision with
reference to findings recorded by the majority decision in the L.G.
Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra) with which we concur and hold are as per
the mandate of the law and the Act.

C. Findings on which we concur with the Tribunal Section 92CA of the Act

41\. Our decision in this and ensuing paragraphs would decide substantial
question No.1. For our decision, we would like to reproduce Section 92CA
Clauses (1), (2), (2A), (2B) and (2C) of the Act which read:

> ―92CA. Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer.--(1) Where any person, being

42\. Section 92CA(1) deals with reference to a TPO by an Assessing Officer,
for computation of arm's length price in relation to an international
transaction or a specified domestic transaction. It requires and mandates
prior approval of the Commissioner. It is undisputed that the Assessing
Officer had taken approval of the Commissioner under sub-section (1) to
Section 92CA of the Act. The controversy raised is that the Assessing Officer
had not specifically referred and no previous approval of the Commissioner was
sought or granted for reference of an international transaction relating to
the AMP expenses. Thus, the ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 35 of 142
valuation of the contract price and computation of the arm's length price,
consequent assessments etc. are without jurisdiction and authority of law.

43\. This argument on behalf of the assessees would have been weighty and
perhaps justified, if the Legislature by the Finance Act, 2012 had not
inserted sub-section (2B). The said Sub-Section is squarely applicable and
negates the challenge. In these appeals under Section 260A of the Act, we are
not concerned with the constitutional validity of the aforesaid retrospective
amendment and are only required to interpret the said provision and apply the
retrospective provision if it is applicable. Under sub-section (2B) to Section
92CA, a TPO to whom reference has been made under sub-section (1), is entitled
to apply the provisions of the Chapter in respect of an international
transaction for which the assessee has not furnished a report under Section
92E of the Act. Thus, where an assessee has failed or not furnished a report
in respect of an international transaction, a specific reference for the said
transaction under sub-section (1) is not required. It is sufficient, if arm's
length pricing issue of any international transaction has been referred to the
TPO.

44\. On careful analysis of sub-section (2B) to Section 92CA of the Act, the
following position emerges:

> (a) There should be reference under sub-section (1) to Section 92CA by an
> Assessing Officer to the TPO in respect of an international transaction.

> (b) The reference should be with prior approval of the Commissioner.

> (c) Satisfaction of conditions (a) & (b) gives jurisdiction to the TPO.

> (d) If during the course of the proceedings, a TPO comes to a conclusion
> that there was an international transaction for which the said assessed has
> not furnished a report under Section 92E, the TPO can go into the question
> of ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 36 of 142 arm's length price and
> apply the provisions of Chapter X. No specific reference in respect of such
> hidden/unknown international transaction is required under sub-section (1)
> to Section 92CA of the Act.

45\. The conditions and requirements referred to above are fairly stringent.
The TPO has to record a finding on satisfaction of the said conditions to
evaluate transfer price of an undeclared and unreported international
transaction. The TPO must justify and establish that there was an
international transaction. Satisfaction of the conditions can be also inferred
from the findings recorded by the TPO. Only when these conditions are
satisfied, the TPO would exercise his jurisdiction. Whether or not the said
conditions are satisfied in a given case, would first depend upon the factual
matrix and also possibly on the appropriate and applicable legal principles.
Wrong assumption of jurisdiction by recording an erroneous finding, deciding
whether there was a hidden or unknown international transaction or whether a
report in respect of the said international transaction under Section 92E was
not furnished, are matters that can be argued and adjudicated in appeal.

46\. After insertion of sub-section (2B) to Section 92CA of the Act, w.e.f.
1st June, 2002, we have to give full effect to the said provision and not
negate or curtail the retrospective effect. A retrospective amendment has a
deeming effect and also consequences. The said effect cannot be unwritten or
erased. The argument of the assessee that sub-section (2B) to Section 92CA was
enacted to protect the additions made by treating the AMP expenses as a
separate international transaction, may or may not be correct. But once the
legislative language is clear and express, we are only required to give effect
to the said retrospective amendment in an appeal under Section 260A of the
Act.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 37 of 142

47\. The majority decision of the Tribunal in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd.
(supra) has rightly drawn a distinction between sub-section (2B) and sub-
section (2A) to Section 92CA of the Act. Sub-section (2A) was inserted in
2011, i.e. nearly one year before insertion of Section (2B) by the Finance
Act, 2012. Sub- section (2A) has not been given retrospective effect and it
applies only w.e.f. 1st June, 2011. Sub-section (2A) applies to any
international transaction or specified domestic transaction of which reference
has not been made to the TPO under sub-section (1). With effect from 1st June,
2011, the TPO can go into arm's length pricing of an international transaction
or a specified domestic transaction not referred to him. The distinction
between sub-section (2A) and (2B) being that the first clause relates to a
declared international transaction, i.e. in respect of which a report under
Section 92E has been furnished, whereas sub- section (2B) refers to
international transactions in respect of which report under Section 92E is not
furnished.

48\. Decision in the case of CIT versus Max India Ltd., [2007] 295 ITR 282
(SC) is not applicable as it examines the power of the Commissioner under
Section 263 of the Act. The said power it was held, in the context of Section
80HHC of the Act, was not rightly exercised at the time when it was exercised,
because the order passed by the Assessing Officer on the said aspect was not
erroneous or wrong. Revisionary power under Section 263 of the Act can only be
exercised when the order passed by the Assessing Officer is erroneous and
prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue; the two conditions being
cumulative. In this context, it was observed that the subsequent amendment to
Section 80HHC in the Act, after the order passed by the Commissioner under
Section 263 of the Act, would not determine whether the order passed by the
Assessing Officer was erroneous or not. The Commissioner had to record a
finding on the date when he passed the order that the order passed by the
Assessing Officer was ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 38 of 142
erroneous. The said pre-requisite was missing, on the date when the order
under Section 263 of the Act was passed.

49\. There is an additional reason why the assessee's contentions must fail.
In the present case, the claim of the assessee is that they had disclosed the
international transaction in their report under Section 92E which included AMP
expenses incurred by them. This aspect relates to merits, i.e. whether or not
there was one composite, bundled or a packaged international transaction, but
once for the said transaction a report in Form 92E was submitted, separate
reference/approval was not required. Reference of the bundled transaction
under sub-section (1) to Section 92CA is sufficient. Section 92CA has to be
interpreted pragmatically. Therefore, once reference of a composite/bundled or
packaged international transaction is made, it will be difficult for the
assessee to contest applicability of sub-section (1) in cases of segregation
or when the TPO invokes sub-section (2B) to Section 92CA of the Act. This flaw
as it existed stands corrected with insertion of Sub-Section (2B) to Section
92CA with retrospective effect. It clarifies and ‗cures' the deficiency and
shortcoming of the earlier provision. In view of insertion of sub section (2B)
to Section 92CA of the Act, the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case
of Commissioner of Income Tax versus Amadeus India Pvt. Ltd. [2013] 351 ITR 92
(Del) and of the Gujarat High Court in Veer Gems versus Assistant Commissioner
of Income Tax [2013] 351 ITR 35 (Guj) would no longer be applicable as the
ratio of the said decisions reflects the position of the statute before
enactment of Sub- Section (2B) with retrospective effect.

50\. With the aforesaid observations, we decide the first substantial question
of law in abstract without reference to the facts as a legal proposition, in
favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 39 of 142

Transaction and International Transaction; Difference between Section 37(1)
and Chapter X of the Act

51\. The term ‗international transaction' has been defined in Section 92B. The
section also had retrospective amendment which was inserted by the Finance
Act, 2012 w.r.e.f. 1st April, 2002. Section 92B(1) reads as under:

> ―Meaning of international transaction.

> 92B -- (1) For the purposes of this section and sections 92, 92C, 92D and
> 92E, ―international transaction‖ means a transaction between two or more
> associated enterprises, either or both of whom are non-residents, in the
> nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property, or
> provision of services, or lending or borrowing money, or any other
> transaction having a bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets of
> such enterprises and shall include a mutual agreement or arrangement between
> two or more associated enterprises for the allocation or apportionment of,
> or any contribution to, any cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in
> connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or to be provided to
> any one or more of such enterprises.‖

52\. The contention that AMP expenses are not international transactions has
to be rejected. There seems to be an incongruity in the submission of the
assessee on the said aspect for the simple reason that in most cases the
assessed have submitted that the international transactions between them and
the AE, resident abroad included the cost/value of the AMP expenses, which the
assessee had incurred in India. In other words, when the assessed raise the
aforesaid argument, they accept that the declared price of the international
transaction included the said element or function of AMP expenses, for which
they stand duly compensated in their margins or the arm's length price as
computed.

53\. We also fail to understand the contention or argument that there is no
international transaction, for the AMP expenses were incurred by the assessed
in India. The question is not whether the assessed had incurred the AMP ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 40 of 142 expenses in India. This is an
undisputed position. The arm's length determination pertains to adequate
compensation to the Indian AE for incurring and performing the functions by
the domestic AE. The dispute pertains to adequacy of compensation for
incurring and performing marketing and ‗non- routine' AMP expenses in India by
the AE. The expenses incurred or the quantum of expenditure paid by the Indian
assessee to third parties in India, for incurring the AMP expenses is not in
dispute or under challenge. This is not a subject matter of arm's length
pricing or determination.

54\. The fact that this expenditure was incurred and has to be allowed as
deduction under Section 37(1) of the Act has not been challenged by the
Revenue. Revenue in their written submission accepts and has rightly stated
that the test of allowability of expenditure under Section 37(1) is whether
the said expenditure is incurred wholly or exclusively for the business
consideration. So long as the expenditure is for business consideration, the
Assessing Officer cannot question the quantum or the wisdom of the assessee in
incurring the expense. Issue of arm's length price, per se does not arise,
when deduction under Section 37(1) is claimed. Expenditure and decision of the
assessee, whether or not to incur the said expenditure; the quantum thereof,
cannot be a subject matter of challenge or disallowance by the Assessing
Officer, once it is accepted that the expenditure was wholly, i.e. the quantum
of expenditure incurred was fully, and exclusively for business purpose. In
Sassoon J. Davit & Co. Pvt. Ltd. versus CIT [1979] 118 ITR 261 (SC), it has
been held that an assessee can claim deduction for expenditure incurred for
business purposes and no one else has authority to decide whether or not the
assessee should have incurred the said expenditure. The expenditure cannot be
disallowed wholly or partly because it would incidentally benefit a third
person once the requirements of Section 37(1) were satisfied. Reference can be
also ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 41 of 142 made to the decision of
Delhi High Court in CIT versus Nestle India Limited [2011] 337 ITR 103 (Del),
holding that the question of reasonableness or measure of expenses to be
allowed cannot be a subject matter of adjustment or disallowance under Section
37(1) of the Act.

55\. Section 40A(2) clause (b) is a provision for computing arm's length price
in case of two related parties as defined and applies even when the conditions
stipulated in Section 37(1) of the Act are satisfied. The said provision
relates to reasonability of the quantum. Similarly, Chapter X of the Act
relates to arm's length pricing adjustment. Chapter X is not concerned with
disallowance of expenditure but relates to determination of arm's length
price/cost of an international transaction between the two AEs. It relates to
income or receipts, and also expenses and interest but in a different context.
Thus, Section 37(1) and Chapter X provisions pertain to different fields.

56\. Chapter X of the Act being a specific statutory provision has to be given
effect to and in view of the said provisions arm's length price can be
determined. The arm's length procedure prescribed in Chapter X, once
applicable has to be given full application. Impact of Chapter X of the Act
cannot be controlled or curtailed by reference to the allowability of
expenditure under Section 37(1) of the Act. As noticed above and subsequently,
provisions of Chapter X are applicable to international transactions between
two related enterprises. The purpose of determination of arm's length price is
to find out the fair and true market value of the transaction and accordingly
the adjustment, if required, is made. The said exercise has its own object and
purpose.

57\. In terms of the aforesaid discussion, question No.2 has to be answered
against the assessed and in favour of the Revenue.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 42 of 142

58\. There are other aspects on which we also agree with the majority judgment
of the Tribunal but would not like to deal with them at this stage but would
refer to the same when we examine these aspects on merits.

D. Transfer Pricing of International Transactions

59\. A significant volume of global trade consists of international transfer
of goods, services, capital and intangibles. As per the United Nations
Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing, 2013, international transfers within MNE
group entities which are called intra group transfers are growing steadily and
account for more than 30% of the total international transactions. What is
actually paid by one entity to another entity in the intra-group transfer is
called the transfer price. Such transactions are controlled transactions
because they are between two associated or connected enterprises as distinct
from uncontrolled transactions which are between two entities which are not
associated and operate on arm's length basis. Transfer Pricing adjustment
enables the tax administration of a country to correct the transfer price and
compute the same on arm's length price, to check, avoid and ensure correct
payment of taxes. Arm's length price in simple words means fair market price.
The reason is that each entity belonging to MNE is treated as a separate
profit centre and every entity should necessarily make profit and loss at
arm's length conditions. This is prevented by correcting either under charging
or over charging by AE in intra group transactions. The key issue, therefore,
in transfer pricing is valuation of the intra group transfers. The arm's
length principle as set forth in Article 9 of the OECD Model Convention
stipulates that ―where conditions are made or imposed between two enterprises
in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would
be made between independent enterprises, then any profit which would, but for
those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of
those conditions, having so accrued, may be ITA 16/2014 & connected matters
Page 43 of 142 included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed
accordingly.‖ The effect of transfer pricing order is to determine whether the
transfer price is the same price which would have been agreed for by
independent enterprises transacting with each other if the price is determined
by market forces. In negates the distortions in the international transaction
price when the transaction is between the two AEs. In nutshell, the basis of
transfer pricing is that each individual entity must be taxed on the basis
that they act at arm's length in the transaction with the other AE.

60\. The aforesaid transfer pricing exercise is enforced and mandated under
the domestic law and in terms of Chapter X of the Act, i.e. the Income Tax
Act, 1961 by adopting or applying one of the specified methods. Transfer
pricing mechanisms are created under domestic law and each country can
formulate detailed domestic legislation to implement and check controlled
pricing. Thus, the transfer pricing regulations may differ from country to
country. In practice, this is partly true. Growing importance of international
trade, globalization and rapid rise in the number of MNEs has resulted in
exhaustive and meticulous research and studies in this complex area. The
transfer pricing methods have seen a measure of standardization, universal
recognition and acceptability. Indian transfer pricing regulations have
adopted and benefited, from the international framework. The OECD Transfer
Pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administration and
United Nations' Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing do reflect the
international understanding on several aspects relating to transfer pricing.
We have taken note and liberally referred to the two guidelines as it is found
to be conducive and helpful in deciding the issues. Their relevance has been
examined in some detail below.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 44 of 142

E. Domestic Law, i.e. the Statutory Provisions of the Act.

61\. Sections 92(1), 92(2) and 92C of the Act, are reproduced herein for the
sake of convenience, ―Computation of income from international transaction
having regard to arm's length price.

92\. (1) Any income arising from an international transaction shall be
computed having regard to the arm's length price.

Explanation.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the
allowance for any expense or interest arising from an international
transaction shall also be determined having regard to the arm's length price.

(2) Where in an international transaction or specified domestic transaction,
two or more associated enterprises enter into a mutual agreement or
arrangement for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to,
any cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit,
service or facility provided or to be provided to any one or more of such
enterprises, the cost or expense allocated or apportioned to, or, as the case
may be, contributed by, any such enterprise shall be determined having regard
to the arm's length price of such benefit, service or facility, as the case
may be.

xxx Computation of arm's length price.

92C. (1) The arm's length price in relation to an international transaction or
specified domestic transaction shall be determined by any of the following
methods, being the most appropriate method, having regard to the nature of
transaction or class of transaction or class of associated persons or
functions performed by such persons or such other relevant factors as the
Board may prescribe, namely:--

(a) comparable uncontrolled price method;

(b) resale price method;

(c) cost plus method;

(d) profit split method;

(e) transactional net margin method;

(f) such other method as may be prescribed by the Board.

(2) The most appropriate method referred to in sub-section (1) shall be
applied, for determination of arm's length price, in the manner as may be
prescribed: Provided that where more than one price is determined by the most
appropriate method, the arm's length price shall be taken to be the
arithmetical mean of such prices:

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 45 of 142

Provided further that if the variation between the arm's length price so
determined and price at which the international transaction or specified
domestic transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed such
percentage [not exceeding three per cent] of the latter, as may be notified by
the Central Government in the Official Gazette in this behalf, the price at
which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has
actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm's length price.

The following third proviso shall be inserted after the second proviso to sub-
section (2) of section 92C by the Finance (No.2) Act, 2014, w.e.f. 1-4-2015:
Provided also that where more than one price is determined by the most
appropriate method, the arm's length price in relation to an international
transaction or specified domestic transaction undertaken on or after the 1st
day of April, 2014, shall be computed in such manner as may be prescribed and
accordingly the first and second proviso shall not apply. Explanation.--For
the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the provisions of the
second proviso shall also be applicable to all assessment or reassessment
proceedings pending before an Assessing Officer as on the 1st day of October,
2009\.

(2A) Where the first proviso to sub-section (2) as it stood before its
amendment by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2009 (33 of 2009), is applicable in
respect of an international transaction for an assessment year and the
variation between the arithmetical mean referred to in the said proviso and
the price at which such transaction has actually been undertaken exceeds five
per cent of the arithmetical mean, then, the assessee shall not be entitled to
exercise the option as referred to in the said proviso.

(2B) Nothing contained in sub-section (2A) shall empower the Assessing Officer
either to assess or reassess under section 147 or pass an order enhancing the
assessment or reducing a refund already made or otherwise increasing the
liability of the assessee under section 154 for any assessment year the
proceedings of which have been completed before the 1st day of October, 2009.
(3) Where during the course of any proceeding for the assessment of income,
the Assessing Officer is, on the basis of material or information or document
in his possession, of the opinion that--

(a) the price charged or paid in an international transaction [or specified
domestic transaction] has not been determined in accordance with sub- sections
(1) and (2); or

(b) any information and document relating to an international transaction [or
specified domestic transaction] have not been kept and maintained by the
assessee in accordance with the provisions contained in sub-section (1) of
section 92D and the rules made in this behalf; or

(c) the information or data used in computation of the arm's length price is
not reliable or correct; or ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 46 of 142

(d) the assessee has failed to furnish, within the specified time, any
information or document which he was required to furnish by a notice issued
under sub-section (3) of section 92D, the Assessing Officer may proceed to
determine the arm's length price in relation to the said international
transaction [or specified domestic transaction] in accordance with sub-
sections (1) and (2), on the basis of such material or information or document
available with him:

Provided that an opportunity shall be given by the Assessing Officer by
serving a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a date and time
to be specified in the notice, why the arm's length price should not be so
determined on the basis of material or information or document in the
possession of the Assessing Officer. (4) Where an arm's length price is
determined by the Assessing Officer under sub-section (3), the Assessing
Officer may compute the total income of the assessee having regard to the
arm's length price so determined: Provided that no deduction under section 10A
[or section 10AA] or section 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in
respect of the amount of income by which the total income of the assessee is
enhanced after computation of income under this sub-section :

Provided further that where the total income of an associated enterprise is
computed under this sub-section on determination of the arm's length price
paid to another associated enterprise from which tax has been deducted 2[or
was deductible] under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB, the income of the other
associated enterprise shall not be recomputed by reason of such determination
of arm's length price in the case of the first mentioned enterprise.‖

62\. We are not elaborately exacerbating the said provisions to avoid
prolixity and would only refer to specifics relevant to decide the present
appeals.

63\. Sub-section (1) to Section 92 states that any income arising from an
international transaction shall be computed having regard to arm's length
price. It includes expense or interest arising from an international
transaction. Sub- Section (2) is an adjunct and intrinsically connected with
Sub- Section (1) to Section 92. It stipulates that Sub-Section (1) shall be
applicable when two or more AEs enter into a mutual agreement or arrangement
for allocation, apportionment or contribution to any cost, expense incurred or
to be incurred in connection with benefit, service or facility provided or to
be provided. An international transaction, therefore, means transaction
between two or more AEs when either one or both are non-resident; the
transaction should be in nature of ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 47 of
142 sale, purchase or lease of tangible or intangible property or in the
nature of provision for services or lending of money or any other transaction
having bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets. A mutual agreement or
arrangement for allocation of expenses would also be an international
transaction. Section 92F defines the term ―transaction‖ broadly and is a very
wide definition, and we observe, that clause (v) thereof stipulates that an
arrangement, understanding or action in concert would be a transaction whether
or not such arrangements, etc. are formal or whether or not such arrangements
are legally enforceable. Under Section 92 (1) and (2), the cost, expense
allocated or apportioned or as the case may be contribution by an AE shall be
determined having regard to the arm's length price of such benefit, service or
facility.

64\. Section 92C(1) is of significance and relevance as it stipulates that
arm's length price in relation to an international transaction can be
determined by any of the five methods stipulated therein, with authority to
the Board to prescribe a sixth method. It is an accepted case that the Board
has prescribed such method in Rule 10AB with effect from 1st April, 2012. The
five methods are (a) Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method; (b) RP Method, i.e.
Resale Price Method; (c) CP Method, i.e. Cost Plus Method; (d) Profit Split
Method; and, (e) TNM Method, i.e. Transactional Net Margin Method. Sub-
sections (1) and (2) to Section 92C casts obligation on the assessed to
compute arm's length price as per the methods prescribed. Consequently, the
burden is on the assessed to select and justify the method adopted and the
arm's length price declared. Under sub-section (3) to Section 92C, the
Assessing Officer can proceed to determine the arm's length price in
accordance with Section 92C(1) and (2) on the basis of material, information
or documents in his possession, if any of the circumstances mentioned in
clauses (a) to (d) are satisfied. The circumstances ITA 16/2014 & connected
matters Page 48 of 142 being: the price paid or charged for an international
transaction has not been determined in accordance with sub-sections (1) and
(2); information or documents relating to an international transaction has not
been kept or maintained in accordance with the provisions of Section 92D(1) or
the Rules; information or data used in computation or arm's length price is
not reliable or correct; or the assessed has failed to furnish, within
stipulated time, information or document required to be furnished as per
notice under sub-section (3) to Section 92D. (See judgment dated 16th
December, 2013 in ITA No. 306/2012 titled Li & Fung India Pvt. Ltd. vs.
Commissioner of Income Tax of the Delhi High Court).

Five Methods

65\. Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (‗CUP Method', for short) compares
price charged for the property or service in a controlled transaction with the
price charged for comparable property or service in an uncontrolled
transaction in comparable circumstances. In RP Method, the price paid for the
product by an independent third party, i.e. the resale price received by an AE
is taken as the basis. The arm's length price is computed by a reverse
exercise by determining the normal gross profit margin, i.e. gross profit
margin, of an unrelated enterprise. Expenses incurred are thereafter, reduced
and adjustments for differences in comparables is made to arrive at the arm's
length price. This method has been explained below when examining the
individual case of M/s Canon India Ltd. and Reebok India Company Ltd. Cost
Plus Method (‗CP Method', for short) requires determination of the appropriate
gross profit margin which would be charged by a comparable and adding the same
mark up to the expenditure/cost incurred by the AE to determine the
appropriate profit in ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 49 of 142 view of
market conditions and functions performed. The aforesaid three methods are
treated as traditional transactional methods.

66\. TNM Method or Profit Split Method are called transactional profit methods
or profit based methods. United Nations' Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing
in paragraph 1.5.10 observes that there is growing acceptance of practical
importance of profits based methods. TNM Method has been elucidated in detail
below. Profit Split Method takes the combined profit earned by two related
parties from one or series of transactions and then divides those profits
using economically valid defined basis and aims on replicating the division of
profits which would have been anticipated in an agreement made at arm's
length. It requires working back from the profit to the price.

Four Steps and Comparables

67\. Without specifics and niceties, the steps involved in making a Transfer
Pricing adjustment under each of the five methods, will involve four steps:-

> a) Ascertain whether there is an international transaction between the
> assessee and its AE,

> b) Ascertain the price at which that transaction has taken place, i.e. the
> transactional or controlled price,

> c) Determine the arm's length price by applying one of the five price
> discovery methods specified in Section 92, i.e. the uncontrolled price.

> d) Compare the transaction price with the arm's length price and make the
> Transfer Pricing adjustment by substituting the arm's length price for the
> contract price.

68\. The five methods stipulated in sub-section (1) to Section 92C, are set
out and articulated step-wise in detail in Rule 10B of the Rules. Be it any of
the ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 50 of 142 five methods, the first
step to be exercised is to identify the international transaction and the
transfer price paid for the same by two AEs. The second step is to carry out
functional analysis i.e. the functions to be performed by the two AEs taking
into account the assets used, risk assumed, the contractual terms, the
economic circumstances of the parties and the business strategy pursued by the
parties. On the question of comparability analysis United Nations' Practical
Manual on Transfer Pricing in paragraph 5.1.1 states that the analysis is used
to designate two distinct but related analytical steps. First being to
understand the economic significant characteristic of the controlled
transaction between the two AEs and the respective roles of the parties
thereto. This has reference to the 5 characteristics i.e. (a) characteristic
of property or services transferred; (b) functions performed by the parties
taking into account assets employed and risk assumed i.e. functional analysis;
(c) contractual terms; (d) economic circumstances and (e) business strategies
pursued. The second analytical steps is comparison of those conditions of the
controlled transactions with uncontrolled transactions i.e. transactions
between the two AEs taking into account the economically significant
characteristics of the controlled transactions and the respective roles of the
5 comparability factors. The aforesaid analysis, therefore, requires selection
of appropriate comparables i.e. an uncontrolled transaction which is to be
compared with a tested party. The comparables can be internal i.e. when one of
the AEs enters into a similar uncontrolled transaction with an independent
enterprise; or external i.e. involving an independent enterprise in the same
market or industry. It is obvious that an internal comparable could in several
cases be more dependable and reliable, than an external comparable. A
comparable is acceptable, if based upon comparison of conditions a controlled
transaction is similar with the conditions in the transactions between
independent enterprises. The comparison must be with reference to the
comparability analysis as elucidated ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 51
of 142 in paragraph 5.1.1 of the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer
Pricing. In other words, the economically relevant characteristics of the two
transactions being compared must be sufficiently comparable. This entails and
implies that difference, if any, between controlled and uncontrolled
transaction, should not materially affect the conditions being examined given
the methodology being adopted for determining the price or the margin. When
this is not possible, it should be ascertained whether reasonably accurate
adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of such differences on the
price or margin. Thus, identification of the potential comparables is the key
to the transfer pricing analysis. As a sequitur, it follows that the choice of
the most appropriate method would be dependent upon availability of potential
comparable keeping in mind the comparability analysis including befitting
adjustments which may be required. As the degree of the comparability
increases, extent of potential differences which would render the analysis
inaccurate necessarily decreases.

69\. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and
Tax Administrations is similarly worded. The selection comparables to be
applied to the tested party, therefore, depends upon transfer pricing method,
for there should be a degree of features which can be usefully compared for
determination of the arm's length price. The characters would include in cases
of transfer of tangible property, the physical features of the property, its
quality, reliability, availability, volume or supply and in cases of service,
the nature and extent of service and in cases of intangible property, the form
of transaction, licensing or sale, the type of property, i.e. trademark,
patent, know- how, the duration and degree of patent and anticipated benefits.
The function analysis test in selection of the comparables seeks to identify
and compare economically significant activities and the responsibilities
undertaken, the asset ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 52 of 142 used and
the risk assumed by the parties to the transaction. The functions, which an
assessee may perform, would include design, manufacturing, assembling,
research and development servicing, purchasing, distribution, marketing,
advertising, transportation, etc. The principal function performed by the
party under examination should be identified. Adjustments should be made for
any material differences from the functions undertaken by the independent
comparable enterprise and the tested party. While examining the functions
performed, the significance of the functions in terms of their frequency,
nature and value to the respective parties is an important factor.

70\. Equally important is the question or assumption of risk, for increased
risk has to be adequately compensated by increase in return. Similarly,
recognition must be given to the economic circumstances in determining the
comparable which include geographic location, size of market, extent of
competition, position of buyers and sales availability or risk of competitive
goods and services, level of demand and supply sold in a particular region,
consumer purchasing power, nature and extent of government control, labour and
capital, transportation, level of the market, i.e. retail or wholesale and so
forth.

The Rules and the analytical steps.

71\. Sub-Sections (1) and (2) to Section 92C are applicable to the assessed,
as well as the Assessing Officer invoking power under Sub-Section (3) to
Section 92C of the Act. As noted above, sub-section (2) to Section 92C
stipulates that most appropriate method, out of the methods specified in sub-
section (1) shall be applied to determine the arm's length price in the manner
as may be prescribed. Rule 10C prescribes the manner for determining the most
appropriate method. Rule 10C reads:-

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 53 of 142

> ―10C. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the most
> appropriate method shall be the method which is best suited to the facts and
> circumstances of each particular international transaction or specified
> domestic transaction, and which provides the most reliable measure of an
> arm's length price in relation to the international transaction or the
> specified domestic transaction, as the case may be.

> (2) In selecting the most appropriate method as specified in sub-rule (1),
> the following factors shall be taken into account, namely:--

(a) the nature and class of the international transaction or the specified
domestic transaction;

(b) the class or classes of associated enterprises entering into the
transaction and the functions performed by them taking into account assets
employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprises;

(c) the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for
application of the method;

(d) the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction
or the specified domestic transaction and the uncontrolled transaction and
between the enterprises entering into such transactions;

(e) the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to
account for differences, if any, between the international transaction or the
specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transaction or
between the enterprises entering into such transactions;

(f) the nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in
application of a method.‖

72\. Sub-rule (1) requires ascertainment of facts and circumstances of a
particular international transaction and the method, which would provide the
most reliable measure of the arm's length price. Sub-rule (2) stipulates that
while selecting the most appropriate method, clauses (a) to (f) should be
taken into account. Therefore, it would be appropriate and proper for the
assessed to indicate why and for what reason the method applied is the most
appropriate. Similarly, if the Assessing Officer/TPO disagree, they should
stipulate and elucidate the reason for selecting or applying a particular
method. Clauses (a) to (f) of sub-rule (2) are wide and prescribe a broad
criteria which has reference ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 54 of 142 to
nature and class of the transaction; nature and class of AE entering into the
transaction; functions performed by them taking into account asset employed or
to be employed and risk assumed. They also refer to availability, coverage and
reliability of data necessary for application of the method; degree of
comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transaction and between
the enterprises; reliability and accuracy of adjustment, which can be made
between the tested and uncontrolled transactions and between enterprises.
Lastly and significantly, it refers to nature, extent and reliability of
assumption required to be made for application of the method.

73\. Rule 10B after elucidating on the five methods, in Sub-rule (2) states
that comparability of an international transaction, i.e. the tested
transaction, with an uncontrolled transaction shall be judged in the manner
stipulated therein. The said Rule reads:-

> "10B. xxx (2) For the purposes of sub-rule (1), the comparability of an
> international transaction or a specified domestic transaction with an
> uncontrolled transaction shall be judged with reference to the following,
> namely:--

(a) the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services
provided in either transaction;

(b) the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be
employed and the risks assumed, by the respective parties to the transactions;

(c) the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing)
of the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the
responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions;

(d) conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to
the transactions operate, including the geographical location and size of the
markets, the laws and Government orders in force, costs of labour and capital
in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and
whether the markets are wholesale or retail.‖ ITA 16/2014 & connected matters
Page 55 of 142

74\. Clause (a) refers to specific characteristics of the property transferred
or services provided. Clause (b) refers to functions performed, assets
employed or to be employed and risk assumed. Clause (c) makes reference to
contractual terms whether in writing or otherwise and to responsibilities,
risk and benefits divided between the respective parties to the transactions.
Clause (d) refers to the conditions prevailing in the markets of the
respective parties to the transactions, overall economic development and level
of competition and whether or not the markets are wholesale or retail.

75\. Equally significant is sub-rule (3) to Rule 10B, which reads:-

―10B. (3) An uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to an international
transaction or a specified domestic transaction if--

(i) none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared,
or between the enterprises entering into such transactions are likely to
materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit arising
from, such transactions in the open market; or

(ii) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material
effects of such differences.‖ To understand sub-rule (3), one must account for
the definition of the term, ―uncontrolled transaction‖. Rule 10A in clause (a)
defines the term, ―Uncontrolled transaction‖ for Rules 10B to 10E, as
transactions between enterprises other than AEs, whether resident or non-
resident. The term ―associated enterprises‖ has been defined in Section 92A of
the Act. The uncontrolled transactions may be between residents or non-
residents. This is immaterial. However, they should not be between two AEs.
They should be between two independent enterprises. Sub-rule (3) to Rule 10B
requires that the transactions should be similar in the manner that the
differences between the transaction being compared or between the enterprises
entered into, should not materially affect the price or the cost charged or
profits arising from such ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 56 of 142
transactions in open market. Uncontrolled transaction can be also treated as a
comparable, when reasonably adequate adjustments can be made to eliminate
material effect of difference(s).

76\. It must be stated that transfer pricing is not an exact science but a
method of legitimate quantification which requires exercise of judgment on the
part of the tax administration and the taxpayer. It is method and formula
based and, therefore, is rational and scientific. However, not being perfect
or infallible, first and the second proviso to sub-section (2) along with
stipulations in Sub- section (2A) and 2(B) of section 92C posit a ‗getaway'
clause when the arm's length price so determined and the controlled price does
not exceed 5%( reduced to 3% w.e.f. 1st April, 2012). In such cases the actual
price paid or received by the assessed from the foreign AE is not disturbed.
In other cases, the transaction price gets substituted with the arm's length
price so determined. Sub-section 2A to Section 92C was inserted by the Finance
Act, 2012 with retrospective effect from 1st April, 2002. It states that where
the arm's length price determined under sub-section (1) exceeds the arm's
length price as declared by 5%, the assessee would not be entitled to exercise
the option under first proviso to sub-section (2) as it stood before its
amendment by the Finance (No.2) Act, 2009. The ―gateway‖ of 5% or 3%, as the
case may be, can be applied if the variation in arm's length price and
transaction/controlled price does not exceed the specified percentage. Sub-
section (2A), therefore, stipulates that where the difference exceeds the
prescribed percentage, the assessee would not be entitled to exercise the
option under the first proviso to sub-section (2) to Section 92C and claim
reduction. Similarly, the first proviso to Section 92C stipulates that where
more than one price is determined by most appropriate method, the arm's length
price shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 57 of 142

77\. As a concept and principle Chapter X does not artificially broaden,
expand or deviate from the concept of ―real income‖. ―Real income‖, as held by
the Supreme Court in Poona Electricity Supply Company Limited versus CIT,
[1965] 57 ITR 521 (SC), means profits arrived at on commercial principles,
subject to the provisions of the Act. Profits and gains should be true and
correct profits and gains, neither under nor over stated. Arm's length price
seeks to correct distortion and shifting of profits to tax the actual income
earned by a resident/domestic AE. The profit which would have accrued had
arm's length conditions prevailed is brought to tax. Misreporting, if any, on
account of non-arm's length conditions resulting in lower profits, is
corrected.

78\. The aforesaid methods are systematic and methodical and in spite of
prescription, there is an element of discretion and flexibility involved in
selection of appropriate method, selection of comparable, functional analysis
or adjustments. This play in the joints and latitude is required and
necessitated as arm's length price is not purely a mathematical formula but a
balanced and rational exercise. The core object and purpose behind the said
exercise is to determine the fair market price of a transaction, had the
transaction been between two independent entities. Under the same method, we
can reach different arm's length prices by relying upon variable factors and
assumptions for the purpose of analysis. We should be more concerned and
focused on reasonableness of the result for the determination is to ascertain
a fair and just result.

G. Section 92(3) of the Act and Bundled / Inter-Connected Transactions

79\. At this stage and before we examine the TNM Method exhaustively, we deem
it necessary to interpret and refer to in some detail sub-section (1) to
Section 92C and reference to the term ‗transaction' with the vowel ‗an', which
has been interpreted by the majority judgment of the Tribunal to mean a single
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 58 of 142 independent transaction and not
a group or bundle of transactions. We do not think that use of vowel ‗an' or
the word ‗transaction' instead of the word ‗transactions' should be given
undue notability and prominence. One of the primary rules of statutory
construction is that singular includes plural and vice- versa. This rule
applies unless a contrary intention is manifest and exhibited. Merely because
a statutory provision is drafted in singularity as opposed to plurality, is
not enough to exclude application of the general rule that singular includes
plural. The rule is not to be discarded on the ground that the relevant
provision is singular or plural and the subsidiary and ancillary provision
follow the same pattern. Contrary intention to exclude this generic rule is
not to be lightly inferred. Contrary intention is not assumed or formed by
confining attention to a specific provision but it would be apposite to
consider the provision in the setting and placement of the legislation. It is
a substance and tenure of the statute which would be meaningfully and
critically determinative. This is the mandate of Section 13(2) of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 (see Newspapers Ltd. versus State Industrial Tribunal AIR
1957 SC 532, Narshimha Murthy versus Susheelabai 1996 (4) SCC 644, J.
Jayalalitha versus Union of India (1999) 5 SCC 138, Blue Metal Industries Ltd
versus RW Dilley (1960) 3 All ER 437, Floor versus Davis (Inspector of Taxes)
(1979) 2 All ER 677, Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Ltd versus Attorney- General
(1965) 1 All ER 225 (PC))

80\. The use of expression ‗class of transaction', ‗functions performed by the
parties' in Section 92C(1) illustrates to the contrary, that the word
‗transaction' can never include and would exclude bundle or group of connected
transactions. More important would be reference to meaning of the term
‗transaction' in Section 92F, clause (v), which as per the said definition
includes an arrangement or understanding or action in concert whether or not
the same is ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 59 of 142 formal or in
writing, whether or not it is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings.
Rule 10A in clause (d) states that ―for the purpose of this Rule and Rules
10AB and 10E‖, the term ‗transaction' would ―include a number of closely
linked transactions‖. This Rule in positive terms declares that the
legislative intent is not to deviate from the generic rule that singular
includes plural. The meaning or definition of the expression ‗transaction' in
clause (d) to Rule 10A read with sub-section (1) to Section 92C, therefore,
does not bar or prohibit clubbing of closely connected or intertwined or
continuous transactions. This is discernible also from sub-rule (2) to Rule
10B quoted above. The sub-rule refers to ‗services provided', ‗functions
performed', ‗contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in
writing) of the transactions' which lay down explicitly or impliedly the
responsibilities, risks and benefits to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions. Use of plurality by way of necessity and
legislative mandate is evident in the said Rule.

81\. Similarly, sub-rule (3) to Rule 10B refers to transactions being compared
or comparison of the enterprises entering into such transactions likely to
affect the price or cost charged etc. A reading of Rule 10C reassures and
affirms that the general principle of plurality is not abandoned or discarded.

82\. There is considerable tax literature and text that CUP Method, i.e.
Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method, RP Method, i.e. Resale Price Method and
CP Method, i.e. Cost Plus Method can be applied to a transaction or closely
linked, or continuous transactions. Profits Split Method and TNM Method
grouped as ‗transactional profit methods', can be equally effective and
reliable when applied to closely linked or continuous transactions. Thus, it
would be inappropriate to proceed with the arm's length computation methods,
with a pre-conceived suppositions on singularity as a statutory mandate.
Clubbing of ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 60 of 142 closely linked,
which would include continuous transactions, may be permissible and not
ostracized. Aggregation of closely linked transactions or segregation by the
assessed should be tested by the Assessing Officer/TPO on the benchmark and
the exemplar; whether such aggregation/ segregation by the assessed should be
interfered in terms of the four clauses stipulated in Section 92C(3) of the
Act, read with the Rules. It would, among other aspects, refer to the method
adopted and whether reliability and authenticity of the arm's length
determination is affected or corrupted.

83\. We now proceed to examine the TNM Method, whether there is prohibition in
applying this method on entity to entity basis, and if not, when is it
permissible to apply entity to entity comparison. The discussion would also
answer the question, when is clubbing or bunching or transactions permissible
in TNM Method.

H. TNM Method Enunciated

84\. The TNM Method is elucidated in clause (e) to Rule 10B(1) of the Rules.
We are reproducing the said Rule as it has been applied by the assessees in
several cases and the TPO has also accepted application of the said method,
but treated the AMP expenses as an independent transaction, a finding upheld
by the majority judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra) and in the
present cases. Clause (e) to Rule 10B(1) reads:

> "10B. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's
> length price in relation to an international transaction or a specified
> domestic transaction shall be determined by any of the following methods,
> being the most appropriate method, in the following manner, namely :--

> xxx

> (e) transactional net margin method, by which,--

> (i) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise from an international
> transaction or a specified domestic transaction entered into with an ITA
> 16/2014 & connected matters Page 61 of 142 associated enterprise is computed
> in relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be
> employed by the enterprise or having regard to any other relevant base;

> (ii) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise or by an unrelated
> enterprise from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such
> transactions is computed having regard to the same base;

> (iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (ii) arising in
> comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the
> differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified
> domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or
> between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could
> materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market;

> (iv) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise and referred to in
> sub-clause (i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin
> referred to in sub-clause (iii);

> (v) the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to
> arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction
> or the specified domestic transaction‖

85\. Sub-clause (i) refers to net profit margin realized by an enterprise from
an AE in an international transaction which could be with reference to cost
incurred; sales affected; assets employed or to be employed in an enterprise
or having regard to any other base. Thus, Sub-clause (1) refers to net profit
in proportion to the selected base. The appropriate base is referred to as the
Profit Level Indicator (‗PLI', for short). Generally, the net profit is
applied with reference to sales, i.e. operating profit margin; operating
expenses, also referred to as the berry ratio; and operating assets, i.e.
return on capital. Clause (i) above, gives a wider selection choice by
stipulating an optional base with reference to any other base. The selection,
it is obvious, must be appropriate.

86\. Under sub-clause (ii), the net profit margin realized from a comparable
uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions is computed having
regard to one of the base.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 62 of 142

87\. Under sub-clause (iii), the net profit margin computed under sub-clause

(ii) has to be adjusted by taking into account difference, if any, between the
international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions or
between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which would affect
the amount of net profit margin in the open market. Sub-clause (iii) permits
subjective adjustments required with reference to differences, if any, between
the controlled and uncontrolled transaction, which would materially affect the
net profit margin in the open market.

88\. Under sub-clause (v), net profit margin thus established, is taken to
arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction.

89\. The TNM Method has seen a transition from a disfavoured comparable
method, to possibly the most appropriate Transfer Pricing method due to ease
and flexibility of applying the compatibility criteria and enhanced
availability of comparables. Net profit record/data is assessable and within
reach. It is readily and easily available, entity-wise in the form of audited
accounts. The TNM Method is a preferred transfer pricing arm's length
principle for its proficiency, convenience and reliability. Ideally, in TNM
Method preference should be given to internal or in-house comparables. In
absence of internal comparables, the taxpayer can and would need to rely upon
external comparables, i.e. comparable transactions by independent enterprises.
For several reasons, database providers, it is apparent, have the requisite
information and data of external comparables to enable comparability analysis
of the controlled and uncontrolled transactions with necessary adjustment to
obtain reliable results under TNM Method. This method also works to the
benefit and advantage of the tax authorities in view of convenience and easier
availability of data not only from third party providers, but on their own
level, i.e. assessment records of other parties.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 63 of 142

90\. The strength of the TNM Method is that net profit indicators are less
affected by transactional differences in comparison with some other methods.
This method is more tolerant to functional differences between controlled and
uncontrolled transactions in comparison with resort to gross profit margins.
Yet the net profit indicators have potentiality to introduce an element of
volatility, primarily for two reasons. Firstly, factors which do not affect
gross profit margin and prices can influence net profit indicators due to
variation of operating expenses or vice-versa. This potentiality has reference
to variation in operational expenses including AMP expenses. The other factors
include tax- payers competitive position in the form of price and margins and
in some cases, it may be difficult to eliminate or compute the effect of these
factors. These difficulties in applying or accepting the TNM Method arise when
there is complexity of functions and each party to the transaction(s) makes
valuable unique contribution. Reliability of the TNM Method is sufficiently
certain where one of the parties makes all contribution involved in the
controlled transaction. This is the position even as per the Revenue's case in
the present set of appeals. Revenue has asserted that the Indian subsidiaries,
i.e. the assessees are mere dummies which implement, promote and incur AMP
expenses for building brand value of the foreign AE. Value addition for the
Indian AE is not pleaded or argued. Selection of the TNM Method where adopted
by the assessee remains unchallenged by the TPO/Assessing Officer.

91\. In case the tested party is engaged in single line of business, there is
no bar or prohibition from applying the TNM Method on entity level basis. The
focus of this method is on net profit amount in proportion to the appropriate
base or the PLI. In fact, when transactions are inter-connected, combined
consideration may be the most reliable means of determining the arm's length
price. There are often situations where closely linked and connected ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 64 of 142 transactions cannot be evaluated
adequately on separate basis. Segmentation may be mandated when controlled
bundled transactions cannot be adequately compared on an aggregate basis.
Thus, taxpayer can aggregate the controlled transactions if the transactions
meet the specified common portfolio or package parameters. For complex
entities or where one of the entities is not ‗plain vanilla distributor', it
should be applied when necessary and applicable comparables on functional
analysis, with or without adjustments are available. Otherwise, the TNM Method
should not be adopted or applied on account of being an inappropriate method.

92\. The majority judgment refers to an example where the Indian AE may have
earned actual profit of Rs.140/-, but returned reduced net profit of Rs.120/-
as the Indian AE had incurred brand building expenses to the tune of Rs.20/-
for the foreign AE, whereas the net profit on sales declared by comparable
uncontrolled transactions was Rs.100/- only. Thus, it was observed that the
costs including AMP expenses are independent of cost of imported raw
material/finished products having some correlation with overall profit. The
example highlights the weakness of the TNM Method. The reasoning would be
equally valid, where no AMP or ‗brand building' expenses are incurred. (See
paragraph 21.8 to 22.10 of the majority decision). The net profit margins can
be affected by variation of operating expenses. Thus, the requirement to
select appropriate comparable and adjustment. It would be inappropriate and
unsound to accept comparables, with or without adjustment and apply TNM
Method, and yet conjecturise and mistrust the arm's length price. TNM Method
would not be the most appropriate method when there are considerable value
additions by the subsidiary AEs. In paragraph 22.9, the majority decision has
observed that all costs including the AMP expenses are independent of cost of
material. This indicates that the observations have been made with reference
to manufacturing ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 65 of 142 activities. It
would not be appropriate and proper to apply the TNM Method in case the Indian
assessed is engaged in manufacturing activities and distribution and marketing
of imported and manufactured products, as interconnected transactions. Import
of raw material for manufacture would possibly be an independent international
transaction viz. marketing and distribution activities or functions. We have
earlier used the term ‗plain vanilla distributor'. When we use the words
‗plain vanilla distributor' we do not mean plain vanilla situations, but value
additions and each party making valuable unique contribution.

93\. An example given below would make it clear:

    
    
                                Particulars                Case 1           Case 2
                        Sales                              1,000            1,000
                        Purchase Price                     600              500
                        Gross Margin                       400              500
                                                           (40%)            (50%)
                        Marketing,    Sale     Promotion   50               150
                        expenses
                        Overhead expense                   300              300
                        Net profit                         50               50
                                                           (5%)             (5%)
    
    
    

The above illustrations draw a distinction between two distributors having
different marketing functions. In case 2, a distributor having significant
marketing functions incurs substantial expenditure on AMP, three times more
than in case 1, but the purchase price being lower, the Indian AE gets
adequately compensated and, therefore, no transfer pricing adjustment is
required. In case we treat the AMP expenses in case 2 as Rs.50/-, i.e.
identical as case 1 and AMP of Rs.100/- as a separate transaction, the
position in case 2 would be:

    
    
                                   Particulars                      Case 2

It is obvious that this would not be the correct way and method to compute the
arm's length price. The purchase price adjustments/set off would be mandated
to arrive at the arm's length price, if the AMP expenses are segregated as an
independent international transaction. The position may be worse for the
assessed, in case the Assessing Officer makes an addition of Rs.100/- and adds
15% thereto by applying CP Method, i.e. Cost Plus Method. Consequently, the
addition made would be of Rs.115/-. When Rs.115/- is added to the TNM Method
computation of Rs.150/-, it would result in the total income of Rs.265/- or a
net profit of 26.5%. Even if the Assessing Officer does not reduce the AMP
expenses from Rs.150/- to Rs.50/-, while computing the arm's length price by
applying the TNM Method, it would yet result in unacceptable anomaly for the
net profit margin would be Rs.50/- plus Rs.115/- or 16.15% instead of 5%.
Besides, the said approach would be illogical and unacceptable for AMP
expenses when segregated as an independent international transaction, must be
treated so in all aspects. These anomalies arise on account of fact that there
was no apportionment and division of the transactional compensation, but the
packaged transaction has been bifurcated and divided into two. This position
is not acceptable as it is irrational and unsound.

94\. The example given by the Tribunal refers to efficiencies or better
management skills of the assessed AE which is not duly accounted. Albeit, this
could be accounted for by way of an adjustment under clause (iii) of Rule
10B(1)(e).

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 67 of 142

95\. Illustratively, as indicated in the majority judgment of the Tribunal net
profit margin would undergo a change in case the operating expenses are
different in case 1 and case 2, as these relate to operational costs and
expenses incurred. Better and more efficient management or other valid ground
or contrarily could justify the difference. If there is substantial difference
in the said figure which cannot be justified and explained, suitable
adjustment is permissible and allowed under clause (iii) of Rule 10B(1)(e). If
the said adjustment is made, and the actual net profit margin is computed, the
difference of Rs.20/- as pointed out by the majority judgment of the Tribunal
would not arise. In the alternative, the comparable or even TNM Method can be
rejected.

96\. The United Nations' Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing in paragraph
6.3.12.1 acknowledges that TNM Method is usually applied to broad comparable
functions, rather than broad controlled transactions. Return on these
functions when measured with the PLI base in proportion to the net profit
margins, would get affected by factors unrelated to arm's length pricing,
which is a negative factor, and for this reason TNM Method is typically
applied when the related parties are engaged in continuous series of
transactions and one of the parties controls intangible assets for which arm's
length price/return is not easy to determine. It is favourable to apply TNM
Method when one party is performing routine marketing, distribution and other
functions that do not involve control over intangible assets as it allows
appropriate return to the party controlling unique or difficult to value
intangible assets. Success or efficacy of a particular method would depend
upon functional analysis of the tested party and the comparable. Once we
accept the comparable on the basis of functional analysis and if required,
after making adjustments, then there should be no difficulty in accepting the
international transfer price. In case of discrepancy, addition may be
justified where the net profit margin declared in the case of the ITA 16/2014
& connected matters Page 68 of 142 tested party is lower than the comparable.
A comparable should be accepted if it deals with the same or identical or
similar property under the same or substantially the same circumstances as the
controlled transaction so as to give reliable and more certain measure of
arm's length result. All methods including the TNM Method acknowledge that
there could be difference between tested part and the comparable on functional
analysis, but this would not be material where it is possible to reasonably
ascertain the effect on account of the differences for which appropriate
adjustments can be made. Thus, selection of the comparable depends upon the
functional analysis, similarity as to the several factors and whether or not
it is possible to make adjustments to account for the material differences in
such circumstances to accept or reject a comparable. Selection of the
appropriate comparable ensures similar profit potential and accordingly
taxation of the subsidiary AE in the country of its residence.

97\. We would also reproduce paragraphs 3.9 to 3.12 of Chapter 3;
comparability analysis from OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises and Tax Administration which reads as under:

> ―3.9 Ideally, in order to arrive at the most precise approximation of arm's
> length conditions, the arm's length principle should be applied on a
> transaction-by-transaction basis. However, there are often situations where

> long-term contracts for the supply of commodities or services, 2. Rights use

> rather than consider the individual transactions on a separate basis.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 69 of 142

98\. Paragraph 3.9 at the outset states that ideally in order to arrive at
more precise approximation, the arm's length computation should be made on
transaction to transaction basis. But this valuation may not possible on
separate basis where there are separate transactions which are closely linked
and continuous. Paragraph 3.11 referred to package deal specially in cases
where the transaction between two AEs is in form of one single agreement with
number of arrangements. Paragraph 3.12 acknowledges the effect of domestic law
or double taxation avoidance agreement which may mandate different tax
treatments to a particular type of income or tax event. In such cases it would
be appropriate to segregate the transactions.

99\. Paragraph 3.12 of the OECD guidelines quoted above also refers to
allocation of price elements of a package or bundle of transactions. It
recommends that segregation should be done in a way that the tax
administration must be able to analyse similar deals between independent
enterprises. This aspect of segregation has been examined separately.

100\. The TPO/Assessing Officer can overrule the assessee as to the method
adopted and select the most appropriate method. The reasons for selecting or
adopting a particular method would depend upon functional analysis,
comparison, which requires availability of data of comparables performing of
similar or suitable functional tasks in a comparable business. When suitable
comparables relating to a particular method are not available and functional
analysis or adjustments is not possible, it would be advisable to adopt and
apply another method. This would mean in the example given above, if the
Assessing Officer/TPO notices that operating expenses in the case of the
tested party are ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 71 of 142 substantially
lower than the comparable or indicative of greater and better efficiency, he
can make suitable adjustments and then compute the operating profit. In case
it is not possible to make adjustment, he may reject the method selected by
the assessed and adopt another method. Several recourses may be available. Of
course, justification and reasons must be stated and elucidated.

101\. However, once the Assessing Officer/TPO accepts and adopts TNM Method,
but then chooses to treat a particular expenditure like AMP as a separate
international transaction without bifurcation/segregation, it would as noticed
above, lead to unusual and incongruous results as AMP expenses is the cost or
expense and is not diverse. It is factored in the net profit of the inter-
linked transaction. This would be also in consonance with Rule 10B(1)(e),
which mandates only arriving at the net profit margin by comparing the profits
and loss account of the tested party with the comparable. The TNM Method
proceeds on the assumption that functions, assets and risk being broadly
similar and once suitable adjustments have been made, all things get taken
into account and stand reconciled when computing the net profit margin. Once
the comparables pass the functional analysis test and adjustments have been
made, then the profit margin as declared when matches with the comparables
would result in affirmation of the transfer price as the arm's length price.
Then to make a comparison of a horizontal item without segregation would be
impermissible.

I. Brand and Brand Building

102\. We begin our discussion with reference to elucidation on the concept of
brand and brand building in the minority decision in the case of L.G.
Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra). The term ‗brand', it holds, refers to
name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller's
goods or ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 72 of 142 services as distinct
from those of others. The word ‗brand' is derived from the word ‗brandr' of
Old Norse language and represented an identification mark on the products by
burning a part.

103\. Brand has been described as a cluster of functional and emotional
values. It is a matter of perception and reputation as it reflects customers'
experience and faith. Brand value is not generated overnight, but is created
over a period of time, when there is recognition that the logo or the name
guarantees a consistent level of quality and expertise. Leslie de Chernatony
and McDonald have described ―a successful brand is an identifiable product,
service, person or place, augmented in such a way that the buyer or user
perceives relevant, unique, sustainable added values which match their needs
most closely.‖ The words of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.1201/1966
decided on 12 th February, 1970 in Khushal Khenger Shah versus Mrs.
Khorshedbanu Dabida Boatwala, to describe ‗goodwill', can be adopted to
describe a brand as an intangible asset being the whole advantage of the
reputation and connections formed with the customer together with
circumstances which make the connection durable. The definition given by Lord
MacNaghten in Commissioner of Inland Revenue versus Muller & Co's Margarine
Ltd., 1901 AC 217 (223) can also be applied with marginal changes to
understand the concept of brand. In the context of ‗goodwill' it was observed:

> ―It is very difficult, as it seems to me, to say that goodwill is not
> property. Goodwill is bought and sold every day. It may be acquired. I
> think, in any of the different ways in which property is usually acquired.
> When a man has got it he may keep it as his own. He may vindicate his
> exclusive right to it if necessary by process of law. He may dispose of it
> if he will -- of course, under the conditions attaching to property of that
> nature..............What is good-will? It is a thing very easy to describe
> very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name,
> reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which
> brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established
> business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business
> must emanate from a ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 73 of 142
> particular centre or source. However, widely extended or diffused its
> influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of
> attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it
> emanates. Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements. It differs in its
> composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same
> trade. One element may preponderate here and another element there. To
> analyse goodwill and split it up into its component parts, to pare it down
> as the Commissioners desire to do until nothing is left but a dry residuum
> ingrained in the actual place where the business is carried on while
> everything else is in the air, seems to me to be as useful for practical
> purposes as it would be to resolve the human body into the various
> substances of which it is said to be composed. The goodwill of a business is
> one whole, and in a case like this it must be dealt with as such. For my
> part, I think that if there is one attribute common to all cases of goodwill
> it is the attribute of locality. For goodwill has no independent existence.
> It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the
> business, and the goodwill perishes with it, though elements remain which
> may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again..............‖

104\. ―Brand‖ has reference to a name, trademark or trade name. A brand like
‗goodwill', therefore, is a value of attraction to customers arising from name
and a reputation for skill, integrity, efficient business management or
efficient service. Brand creation and value, therefore, depends upon a great
number of facts relevant for a particular business. It reflects the reputation
which the proprietor of the brand has gathered over a passage or period of
time in the form of widespread popularity and universal approval and
acceptance in the eyes of the customer. To use words from Commissioner of
Income Tax versus Chunilal Prabhubas & Co. AIR 1971 Cal 70, it would mean :

> ―... It has been horticulturally and botanically viewed as ―a seed
> sprouting‖ or an ―acorn growing into the mighty Oak of goodwill‖. ... It has
> been historically explained as growing and crystallising traditions in the
> business. It has been described in terms of a magnet as the ―attracting
> force‖. In terms of comparative dynamics, goodwill has been described as the
> ―differential return of profit.‖ Philosophically it has been held to be
> intangible, Though immaterial, it is materially valued. Physically and
> psychologically, it is a ―habit‖ and sociologically it is a ―custom‖.
> Biologically, it has been described by Lord Macnaghten in Trego v. Hunt,
> 1896 AC 7 as the ―sap and life‖ of the business. It has been horticulturally
> and botanically viewed as ―a seed sprouting‖ or an ―acorn growing into the
> mighty Oak of goodwill‖. It has been geographically described by locality.
> It has been historically explained as ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page
> 74 of 142 growing and crystallising traditions in the business. It has been

> ―habit‖ and sociologically it is a ―custom‖. Biologically, it has been
> described by Lord Macnaghten in Trego v. Hunt, 1896 AC 7 as the ―sap and
> life‖ of the business.‖

105\. There is a line of demarcation between development and exploitation.
Development of a trademark or goodwill takes place over a passage of time and
is a slow ongoing process. In cases of well recognised or known trademarks,
the said trademark is already recognised. Expenditures incurred for promoting
product(s) with a trademark is for exploitation of the trademark rather than
development of its value. A trademark is a market place device by which the
consumers identify the goods and services and their source. In the context of
trademark, the said mark symbolises the goodwill or the likelihood that the
consumers will make future purchases of the same goods or services. Value of
the brand also would depend upon and is attributable to intangibles other than
trademark. It refers to infrastructure, know-how, ability to compete with the
established market leaders. Brand value, therefore, does not represent
trademark as a standalone asset and is difficult and complex to determine and
segregate its value. Brand value depends upon the nature and quality of goods
and services sold or dealt with. Quality control being the most important
element, which can mar or enhance the value.

106\. Therefore, to assert and profess that brand building as equivalent or
substantial attribute of advertisement and sale promotion would be largely
incorrect. It represents a coordinated synergetic impact created by assortment
largely representing reputation and quality. There are a good number of
examples where brands have been built without incurring substantial
advertisement or promotion expenses and also cases where in spite of extensive
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 75 of 142 and large scale advertisements,
brand values have not been created. Therefore, it would be erroneous and
fallacious to treat brand building as counterpart or to commensurate brand
with advertisement expenses. Brand building or creation is a vexed and
complexed issue, surely not just related to advertisement. Advertisements may
be the quickest and effective way to tell a brand story to a large audience,
but just that is not enough to create or build a brand. Market value of a
brand would depend upon how many customers you have, which has reference to
brand goodwill, compared to a baseline of an unknown brand. It is in this
manner that value of the brand or brand equity is calculated. Such
calculations would be relevant when there is an attempt to sell or transfer
the brand name. Reputed brands do not go in for advertisement with the
intention to increase the brand value, but to increase the sales and thereby
earn larger and greater profits. It is not the case of the Revenue that the
foreign AEs are in the business of sale/transfer of brands.

107\. Accounting Standard 26 exemplifies distinction between expenditure
incurred to develop or acquire an intangible asset and internally generated
goodwill. An intangible asset should be recognised as an asset, if and only
if, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the said
asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be measured
reliably. The estimate would represent the set off of economic conditions that
will exist over the useful life of the intangible asset. At the initial stage,
intangible asset should be measured at cost. The above proposition would not
apply to internally generated goodwill or brand. Paragraph 35 specifically
elucidates that internally generated goodwill should not be recognised as an
asset. In some cases expenditure is incurred to generate future economic
benefits, but it may not result in creation of an intangible asset in form of
goodwill or brand, which meets the recognition criteria under AS-26.
Internally generated goodwill or ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 76 of
142 brand is not treated as an asset in AS-26 because it is not an
identifiable resource controlled by an enterprise, which can be reliably
measured at cost. Its value can change due to a range of factors. Such
uncertain and unpredictable differences, which would occur in future, are
indeterminate. In subsequent paragraphs, AS-26 records that expenditure on
materials and services used or consumed, salary, wages and employment related
costs, overheads, etc. contribute in generating internal intangible asset.
Thus, it is possible to compute goodwill or brand equity/value at a point of
time, but its future valuation would be perilous and an iffy exercise.

108\. In paragraph 44 of AS-26, it is stated that intangible asset arising
from development will be recognised only and only if amongst several factors,
it can demonstrate a technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset
so that it will be available for use or sale and the intention is to complete
the intangible asset for use or sale is shown or how the intangible asset will
generate probable future benefits, etc.

109\. The aforesaid position finds recognition and was accepted in
Commissioner of Income Tax versus B. C. Srinivasa Setty, (1981) 2 SCC 460
(SC), a decision relating transfer to goodwill. Goodwill, it was held, was a
capital asset and denotes benefits arising from connection and reputation. A
variety of elements go into its making and the composition varies in different
trades, different businesses in the same trade, as one element may pre-
dominate one business, another element may dominate in another business. It
remains substantial in form and nebulous in character. In progressing
business, brand value or goodwill will show progressive increase, but in
falling business, it may vain. Thus, its value fluctuates from one moment to
another, depending upon reputation and everything else relating to business,
personality, business rectitude of the owners, impact of contemporary market
reputation, etc. ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 77 of 142 Importantly,
there can be no account in value of the factors producing it and it is
impossible to predicate the moment of its birth for it comes silently into the
world unheralded and unproclaimed. Its benefit and impact need not be visibly
felt for some time. Imperceptible at birth, it exits unwrapped in a concept,
growing or fluctuating with numerous imponderables pouring into and affecting
the business. Thus, the date of acquisition or the date on which it comes into
existence is not possible to determine and it is impossible to say what was
the cost of acquisition. The aforesaid observations are relevant and are
equally applicable to the present controversy.

110\. It has been repeatedly held by Delhi High Court that advertisement
expenditure generally is not and should not be treated as capital expenditure
incurred or made for creating an intangible capital asset. Appropriate in this
regard would be to reproduce the observations in CIT versus Monto Motors Ltd,
[2012] 206 Taxman 43 (Del), which read:-

> ―4. ... Advertisement expenses when incurred to increase sales of products
> are usually treated as a revenue expenditure, since the memory of purchasers
> or customers is short. Advertisement are issued from time to time and the
> expenditure is incurred periodically, so that the customers remain attracted
> and do not forget the product and its qualities. The advertisements
> published/displayed may not be of relevance or significance after lapse of
> time in a highly competitive market, wherein the products of different
> companies compete and are available in abundance. Advertisements and sales
> promotion are conducted to increase sale and their impact is limited and
> felt for a short duration. No permanent character or advantage is achieved
> and is palpable, unless special or specific factors are brought on record.
> Expenses for advertising consumer products generally are a part of the
> process of profit earning and not in the nature of capital outlay. The
> expenses in the present case were not incurred once and for all, but were a
> periodical expenses which had to be incurred continuously in view of the
> nature of the business. It was an on-going expense. Given the factual
> matrix, it is difficult to hold that the expenses were incurred for setting

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 78 of 142

(Also see, CIT versus M/s Spice Distribution Ltd., ITA No.597/2014, decided by
the Delhi High Court on 19th September, 2014; and CIT versus Salora
International Limited, [2009] 308 ITR 199])

111\. Accepting the parameters of the ‗bright line test' and if the said
parameters and tests are applied to Indian companies with reputed brands and
substantial AMP expenses, would lead to difficulty and unforeseen tax
implications and complications. Tata, Hero, Mahindra, TVS, Bajaj, Godrej,
Videocon group and several others are both manufacturers and owners of
intangible property in the form of brand names. They incur substantial AMP
expenditure. If we apply the ‗bright line test' with reference to indicators
mentioned in paragraph 17.4 as well as the ratio expounded by the majority
judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd case (supra) in paragraph 17.6 to
bifurcate and segregate AMP expenses towards brand building and creation, the
results would be startling and unacceptable. The same is the situation in case
we apply the parameters and the ‗bright line test' in terms of paragraph 17.4
or as per the contention of the Revenue, i.e. AMP expenses incurred by a
distributor who does not have any right in the intangible brand value and the
product being marketed by him. This would be unrealistic and impracticable, if
not delusive and misleading. (Aforesaid reputed Indian companies, it is
patent, are not to be treated as comparables with the assessed, i.e. the
tested parties in these appeals, for the latter are not legal owners of the
brand name/trademark.)

112\. Branded products and brand image is a result of consumerism and a
commercial reality, as branded products ‗own' and have a reputation of
intrinsic believability and acceptance which results in higher price and
margins. Trans- border brand reputation is recognized judicially and in the
commercial world. Well known and renowned brands had extensive goodwill and
image, even before they became freely and readily available in India through
the subsidiary ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 79 of 142 AEs, who are
assessees before us. It cannot be denied that the reputed and established
brands had value and goodwill. But a new brand/ trade-mark/ trade- name would
be relatively unknown. We have referred to the said position not to make a
comparison between different brands but to highlight that these are relevant
factors and could affect the function undertaken which must be duly taken into
consideration in selection of the comparables or when making subjective
adjustment, and thus, for computing the arm's length price. The aforesaid
discussion substantially negates and rejects the Revenue's case. But there are
aspects and contentions in favour of the Revenue which requires elucidation.

J. Bright Line Test

113\. The majority decision of the Tribunal holds that excessive AMP expenses
beyond the ‗bright line test' should be treated as a separate international
transaction for promoting the brand owned by the foreign AE. The minority
opinion is to the contrary. Discussion on this issue would involve several
aspects, whether the TPO/Assessing Officer can apply the ‗bright line test' to
split the AMP expenses, as essential and non-routine; paragraph 17.6 rejecting
AEs of reputed brands as comparables; whether the ‗bright line tests'
comparables mentioned in paragraph 17.4 of the majority decision are justified
and correct; whether the CP Method is the appropriate method; and concept and
effect of economic ownership of brand. Discussion under the heading ‗I' ‗Brand
and Brand Building', deals and answers several issues. In order to decide
remaining aspects, we would like to reproduce the following relevant
paragraphs from the majority judgment:

> ―9.10. We do not find any force in the contention of the ld. DR that the
> mere fact of the assessee having spent proportionately higher amount on
> advertisement in comparison with similarly placed independent entities be
> considered as conclusive to infer that some part of the ITA 16/2014 &
> connected matters Page 80 of 142 advertisement expenses were incurred
> towards brand promotion for the foreign AE. Every businessman knows his
> interest best. It is for the assessee to decide that how much is to be
> incurred to carry on his business smoothly. There can be no impediment on
> the power of the assessee to spend as much as he likes on advertisement. The
> fact that the assessee has spent proportionately more on advertisement can,

> 15.8. In the present case, the assessee did not declare any cost/value of

xxx‖ Paragraph Nos.17.4 and 17.6 have been quoted above.

114\. Revenue during the course of arguments had made reference to the United
Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries, Chapter
2 relating to business framework. The said chapter gives exhaustive background
material on the MNEs, their cross-border operations, value chain analysis,
organisation or legal/commercial structure, etc. In the said chapter, in
Figure 2.1, exposits details of Value Chain Analysis of the MNEs and their
interaction with third parties including the subsidiaries. The said figure is
as under:-

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 86 of 142

115\. In the written arguments filed by the Revenue, it is stated that the
various MNEs use different business models, sometimes country specific. Some
of the common business models used have been elucidated as under:-

> (i) Execute licensing agreements with independent parties for manufacturing
> the product having brands owned by the MNCs. Since these products have
> established brands, MNCs charge franchise fees or royalty for use of brands
> and technology developed by them. Prominent examples of this model are
> Domino's Pizza being sold by independent party Jubilant Food Works Ltd. or
> undergarments of Jockey brand sole by Page Industries Ltd.

> (ii) Establish a subsidiary for carrying out the distribution function.
> Examples of this include various appellants before this court.

> (iii) Establish a subsidiary for carrying out the distribution and
> manufacturing function. Maruti Suzuki Ltd. one of the appellants is an
> example of this business mode.

> (iv) Establish a subsidiary for manufacturing the product and use
> independent companies for distribution. Pepsi Foods Ltd. is an example of
> this type. It manufactures concentrate which is then sold to bottlers. Some
> of the bottlers are associated enterprises (AEs) of Pepsi group but some
> others are independent parties.

> (v) Establishment of a subsidiary for carrying out only marketing support
> services (customers are identified by these subsidiaries and orders are
> negotiated by the foreign MNC and sales are directly made by foreign MNCs to
> Indian customers). In these models, the foreign companies invariably ITA
> 16/2014 & connected matters Page 87 of 142 remunerate the Indian subsidiary
> with the cost together with some additional fee for such market support
> activities.‖

116\. It was urged by the Revenue that development of markets for the products
is the core function of the entrepreneur, which in this case is the foreign
company, an AE. Implementation depends upon the business models of MNEs and
how they want this core function to be exercised. Performance of this function
clearly benefits the brands and market intangibles owned by the parent
company. The test to determine whether the Indian subsidiary was/is incurring
the AMP expenses for itself or at the instance of the AE was/is to find out
whether an independent party would have undertaken the same level of AMP
expenses. An independent party with short-term agreement with an MNE would not
incur costs which give long-term benefits of brand and market development
advantage to another entity. It is fallacious to contend that brand promotion
would benefit an independent entity, for increase in volume of sales largely
benefits the manufacturer both in terms of the profit with increased sales and
enhanced value to the brand. Benefit to the Indian entity is only marginal or
incidental. The contention is that the action of the independent subsidiary
amounts to rendering of service to the foreign AE for which arm's length
compensation was/is payable. No third party distributor would incur
expenditure on development of marketing and brand, which does not eventually
belong to it.

117\. We have already dealt with and examined the concept of brand as an
intangible asset. Routine or day-to-day marketing or sale promotion expenses
even, when excessive and exorbitant, would not amount per se to ―brand
building‖ expenses. The Revenue in the written submissions in fact have
accepted in paragraph 8.8 that promotion of products go hand in hand and at
most of the times brand is distinguishable from products as only by display of
products in a particular manner or emphasis on a particular feature of the ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 88 of 142 product, the consumer is given the
message of what to expect from a given ―brand‖ (sic, product). Hence, it is
difficult to compartmentalise promotion of product or promotion of brand
expenses and record them as separate from each other. The aforesaid assertions
reflect the thin edge and the difficult path Revenue has adopted in
bifurcating AMP expenses into marketing or sale promotions and ―brand
building‖ by creating and adopting the ―bright line test‖. We have elaborately
discussed the concept of term ―brand‖ and ―brand building‖ and observe that it
would be incorrect to treat advertisement as equivalent or synonymous with
―brand building‖ for the latter in commercial sense refers to several facets
and components. The primary being the quality and reputation of the product or
name, which is acquired gradually and silently over a passage of time. The
aforesaid arguments fails to notice the fundamental principle of international
taxation and Chapter X of the Act that the foreign AE and the Indian AE are
two separate tax centres and taxable entities. Profits or enhanced profits
consequent to higher manufacturing turnover would be taxed in the hands of the
foreign AE, whereas higher profits as a result of increased turnover relatable
to distribution and marketing functions would be taxed in the hands of the
Indian subsidiary, i.e. the AE. The position would be different if the foreign
AE has Permanent Establishment in India. The Revenue has generalised and the
argument adopts a universal and ubiquitous approach in the contention that
increased turnover would not benefit the Indian AE. The argument is sceptical
and conjectural. Moreover, transfer pricing can always correct profit
shifting, albeit, by reducing/increasing price/consideration payable to the
Indian AE.

118\. The Indian subsidiaries in the present case are engaged in distribution
and marketing functions of the products manufactured by foreign AEs and in
some cases, products are also manufactured by them under license in India.
Figure ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 89 of 142 2.1 refers to the value
chain analysis, and treats ‗marketing' and ‗distribution' as two headings, but
this does not mean that marketing and distribution functions cannot be
combined and treated as one package or a bundle. The functions performed could
be both marketing and distribution. Marketing in the form of sale promotion,
advertisements, etc. would necessarily involve expenditure both in terms of
third party expenditure which the Indian assessee would liable to incur, as
also towards the office maintenance and other overhead expenses. Even as one
package or a bundle, the Indian subsidiary, i.e. an assessee, must be
adequately compensated by adhering to the arm's length price. This is the core
of the transfer pricing adjudication. Price paid by or compensation paid to
the domestic AE must complement and reciprocate for the functions performed.

119\. A pure distribution company would be a comparatively low risk company as
compared to a marketing and distribution company. The profits and earnings or
arm's length price would accordingly vary. The arm's length price in case of a
pure distribution company would enure lower price/profit as compared to a
company engaged in distribution and marketing. In most of the cases,
distribution and marketing operations would go hand in hand. Marketing itself
is a term of wide import and connotation, which includes development of
marketing strategy which may have certain common worldwide elements and would
normally be the creation and premised by the parent foreign AE but the Indian
assessee engaged in marketing operations could devise its own marketing
strategies, determine as to the nature and type of advertisements, media
selection, timings, etc. Even the choice of products could depend upon
local/national conditions. While determining the arm's length price, the issue
would be whether or not the Indian assessee is adequately compensated by the
foreign AE. The Indian assessee also benefits from the increased sales which
results in higher profits and more taxable income in India. AMP, i.e. ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 90 of 142 advertisements, marketing and sale
promotions, therefore, benefit both the Indian AE, i.e. the assessee and the
foreign AE resident abroad. Same is true and correct position even in case of
a distribution company, though in the said case sales would increase and there
would not be any element of AMP. The fact that increased sales benefit the
foreign manufacturer is the reason why services of Indian assessees have been
engaged by the AEs resident abroad. This argument itself does not show that
brand building is being independently undertaken and, therefore, should be
treated as a separate international transaction. However, the arm's length
computation made both by the assessee as well as the TPO must take into
account the AMP expenses.

120\. Notwithstanding the above position, the argument of the Revenue goes
beyond adequate and fair compensation and the ratio of the majority decision
mandates that in each case where an Indian subsidiary of a foreign AE incurs
AMP expenditure should be subjected to the ‗bright line test' on the basis of
comparables mentioned in paragraph 17.4. Any excess expenditure beyond the
bright line should be regarded as a separate international transaction of
brand building. Such a broad-brush universal approach is unwarranted and would
amount to judicial legislation. During the course of arguments, it was
accepted by the Revenue that the TPOs/Assessing Officers have universally
applied ‗bright line test' to decipher and compute value of international
transaction and thereafter applied ‗Cost Plus Method' or ‗Cost Method' to
compute the arm's length price. The said approach is not mandated and
stipulated in the Act or the Rules. The list of parameters for ascertaining
the comparables for applying bright line test in paragraph 17.4 and,
thereafter, the assertion in paragraph 17.6 that comparison can be only made
by choosing comparable of domestic cases not using any foreign brand, is
contrary to the Rules. It amounts to writing and prescribing a mandatory
procedure or test which is not stipulated in the Act or ITA 16/2014 &
connected matters Page 91 of 142 the Rules. This is beyond what the statute in
Chapter X postulates. Rules also do not so stipulate. The argument and
reasoning in paragraph 17.6 in a way loses focus on the main issue and
controversy; whether the arm's length price fixed between the two AEs is
adequate and justified and would have been paid if the transaction was between
two independent enterprises. The two independent enterprises must be two
unrelated parties having no connection. It does not matter whether the
comparables are domestic enterprises or not. However, and it is manifest that
the comparable should have similar rights, if any, as the tested party in the
brand name, trademark, etc.

121\. During the course of hearing before us, counsel for the Revenue had
submitted that paragraph 17.4 should be treated as illustrations and not as
binding comparables. We would prefer to observe, that an Assessing Officer/
TPO can go and must examine the question whether the assessee is performing
functions of a pure distributor or performing distribution and marketing
functions, in the latter case, he must examine and ascertain whether the
transfer price takes into consideration the marketing function, which would
include AMP functions. This would ensure adequate transaction price and hence
assure no loss of revenue. When the distribution and marketing functions are
inter- connected and reliable comparables are available, arm's length price
could be computed as a package, if required and necessary by making adequate
adjustments. When the Assessing Officer/TPO comes to the conclusion that it is
not possible to compute arm's length price without segregating and dividing
distribution and marketing or AMP functions, he can so proceed after giving
justification and adequate reasons. At that stage, he would have apportioned
the price received or the compensation paid by the foreign AE towards
distribution and marketing or AMP functions. The TPO can then apply an
appropriate method and compute the arm's length price of the two independently
and even ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 92 of 142 by applying separate
methods. This will be in terms of the provisions of the Act and the Rules and
also as per the general principles of international taxation accepted and
applied universally. On the other hand, as recorded by us above, applying
‗bright line test' on the basis of parameters prescribed in paragraphs 17.4
and 17.6 would be adding and writing words in the statute and the Rules and
introducing a new concept which has not been recognised and accepted in any of
the international commentaries or as per the general principles of
international taxation accepted and applied universally. There is nothing in
the Act or the Rules to hold that it is obligatory that the AMP expenses must
and necessarily should be subjected to ‗bright line test' and the non-routine
AMP expenses as a separate transaction to be computed in the manner as
stipulated.

122\. During the course of hearing, our attention was drawn to United States
ISR Regulations, 4.1.2004 Edition, section 1.482-4, Methods to determine
taxable income in connection with a transfer of intangible property and also
the final regulations 26 CPR Parts 1 and 31 and 602 effective from 31 st July,
2009. These are specific regulations framed and applicable in the United
States. Care and caution has to be used when we make reference or apply these
regulations or interpretation placed by the IRS, in United States of America.
1.482-4 of 2009 Regulations, relating to methods to determine taxable income
in connection with transfer of intangible property, elucidates that arm's
length consideration for contribution by one controlled taxpayers that
develops or enhances the value or may be reasonably anticipated to develop or
enhance the value of an intangible property of the other AE, would depend upon
several circumstances. If the consideration for such contribution is embedded
within the contractual term for the controlled transaction, then ordinarily no
separate allocation will be made for such contribution. Thereafter, examples
have been given. It stands recorded that the comparability analysis would
include ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 93 of 142 consideration of all
relevant factors, including compensation for the activities performed by the
subsidiary and that it is provided in the transfer price, rather than provided
by a separate agreement. Reference is also made to requirement to pay royalty
and the effect thereof. In 1.482-6, in the context of Profit Split Method, it
is recorded that allocation of income to controlled taxpayers, routine
contribution will not reflect profit attributable to each controlled taxpayers
contribution, but non-routine contribution is not to be accounted for as
routine contribution. A non-routine contribution of intangible property may be
measured by external benchmarks that reflect the fair market value of such
intangible property, or in alternative the relative value of non-routine
property contributions may be estimated by capital cost of differentiating the
intangible property and all related improvements updates, less an appropriate
amount of amortisation based on the useful life of each intangible property.
In the present case, none of the parties had applied Profit Split Method and,
therefore, the observations in paragraph 1.482-6 would not be of much
relevance. Section 1.482-4, however, does state that development or
enhancement of intangible property owned by another controlled taxpayer should
be accounted for in evaluating the availability of the controlled transaction
with comparable transactions. We have quoted the Indian position on the
subject under the heading ―Brand and brand building‖. We are not examining and
evaluating Profit Split Method. We have accepted the need and postulate of
adequate compensation to the domestic AEs for incurring AMP expenses.

123\. Australian Income Tax Assessment Act, 1997, as amended up to Act No.124,
213, is lucid and has tangible illustrations. On question of identifying the
most suitable method, it is observed that the most appropriate and relevant
method should have regard to all factors including respective strength and
weaknesses of possible methods in their application to actual conditions, the
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 94 of 142 circumstances including
functions performed, assets used and risk borne by the entities, availability
of reliable information required to apply a particular method and degree of
comparability between actual circumstances and comparable circumstances,
including reliability of adjustments to eliminate the effect of material
differences. In identifying comparable circumstances, functions, assets and
risk analysis, characteristics of property or services transferred, terms of
the relevant contract, economic circumstances and the business strategies of
the entities assume importance. Circumstances are comparable to actual
circumstances, if and to the extent that the circumstances differ from actual
circumstances, when the said difference does not materially affect a condition
that is relevant to the method or reasonably adequate adjustment can be made
to eliminate the effect of the difference on the condition that is relevant to
the method. Illustrations, six in number, draw distinction between long-term
distribution or distribution-cum-marketing agreements and short-term
contractual arrangements. The resident AEs must be compensated by the foreign
AE for the services provided; whether it be in the nature of pure distribution
or promotional services; or services as a marketer which also undertakes
advertisement and sale promotion expenses resulting in return attributable to
marketing intangibles. A long-term pure distributor, who bears no cost or risk
of development and market, would not be entitled to any return on the
marketing intangibles. Same would be the position in a short-term contract. In
case of a long-term contract where marketing expenditures are not abnormal and
the resident AE has been proportionately compensated for marketing activities,
no separate addition towards compensation is warranted. In cases of long-term
contract of exclusive and market distribution rights for a trademark product,
where market development activities and extraordinary marketing expenditures
are in excess of what comparable independent enterprise with similar rights
would incur, adjustment may be required, ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page
95 of 142 provided such compensation has not been paid. Reference was made to
paragraph 6.38 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which stipulate that
the said AE might obtain an additional return from the owner of the trademark
perhaps through a lower purchase price of the product or reduction in royalty
rate. It could also be direct compensation. For distinguishing short-term and
long-term contracts, reference has been made to paragraph 3.74 and 2.130 of
the 2010 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, to observe that this has to be
determined ordinarily based on the conditions existing at the start of the
arrangement and, therefore, the consequent effect that a contract is or is not
renewed, ordinarily would not be a factor in its initial pricing. This may be
otherwise, if there is evidence at the start of the arrangement to indicate
that the contract would be renewed. Therefore, in cases of short-term
contract, adjustment would be justified, if there is no direct compensation;
marketing expenditure incurred is not included in the profit element by
reduction of price or royalty payable. This would be accounted for while
taking into account the available data about profits of comparable independent
enterprises during the corresponding years of similar short-term marketing and
distribution agreements. The examples also deal with re-negotiation.

124\. There is a difference between a pure and a simple independent
distributor and a distributor with marketing rights. An independent
distributor with a full marketing right is a person or an entity legally
independent of the manufacturer, who purchases goods from the manufacturer for
re-sale on its own accounts. The transaction between the two is a
straightforward sale in which the distributor takes all economic risk of
product distribution and ultimately gains or makes loss depending upon market
and other conditions. The manufacturer is not concerned. In case of a low or
no risk distributor and he virtually acts as an agent for the loss and gain is
that of the manufacturer. There is no economic ITA 16/2014 & connected matters
Page 96 of 142 risk on distribution of profits. He is, therefore, entitled to
fixed remuneration for the self efforts, i.e., relating to the task or
function of distribution. Similar will be the position of a low risk
distributor with marketing functions, except that the said distributor should
be compensated for the marketing, including AMP function. A distributor with
marketing function can be normal or a high risk distributor. Such distributors
should be compensated but the quantum of compensation would be higher. Such
cases have to be distinguished from cases of a true distributor, who is in an
independent business, uses his own money for purchasing at a low price and
selling at a high price and accordingly shoulders the burden in case of a bad
judgment. Profits or losses, therefore, correspond to the risk and market
consideration. There is also functional incompatibility between a distributor
and a retailer. Retailers cannot be compared with distributor also performing
marketing functions. Foreign global enterprises frequently adopt a subsidiary
model, i.e. the products are distributed and marketed in a targeted country
through a wholly owned subsidiary or a sales subsidiary. A comparable would be
an unrelated identity with similar distribution and marketing functions.

125\. The United Nations' Manual in Chapter 10 relating to country specific
practices notes the Indian stand, but records that the first nine chapters of
the Manual provide practical guidance for application of transfer pricing
rules based upon Article 9(1) of the U.N. Model Tax Convention and the arms
length principle embodied therein. However, there were disagreements on
certain points in the sub-committees and Chapter 10 records individual
country's view point and experiences for information of readers. This does not
reflect a consistent or consensus view of the sub-committee (See paragraph
10.1.1.2)

126\. The United Nations' Manual Transfer Pricing in paragraph 10.4.8.15
records that determination of arm's length price in cases of marketing ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 97 of 142 intangibles would involve
functional assets analysis of the profile of the Indian entity and the parent
company to ascertain whether Indian entity has a risk free, limited risk
bearing or risk bearing entity. This mandates identification of the nature,
types and stages of development of marketing intangibles, i.e. whether the
foreign parties are new entrants into the Indian market and, therefore,
related party in India would incur substantial expenses. Awareness of the
trade mark or brand profit or services of the parent company in India,
customer loyalty and the brand existence of dealer network whether the Indian
entity is to provide after sales service the support, market and customer
details, etc. It acknowledged that the stand of the Indian tax authorities,
who have applied the concept of ‗bright line test' of no risk or limited risk
distributor or to determine non-routine expenses, has led to multifarious
challenges on several account. However, it stands recorded in sub- paragraph
No.18 that the important issue in determination of arm's length price is to
examine the benefits of the AMP expenditure and whether Indian entities do not
receive share of excess profits related to local marketing intangible.
Accordingly, the claim of the Revenue is that extraordinary AMP expenditure
does not result in appropriate enhancement of profitability of Indian
subsidiary or related party. The question, therefore, when a subsidiary entity
engaged in distribution and marketing incurs AMP expenses, is to ascertain
whether the subsidiary AE entity has been adequately and properly compensated
for undertaking the said expenditure. Such compensation may be in the form of
lower purchase price, non or reduced payment of royalty or by way of direct
payments to ensure adequate profit margin. This ensures proper payment of
taxes and curtails avoidance or lower taxes of the Indian subsidiary as a
separate juristic entity.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 98 of 142

127\. We agree and accept the position in the portion reproduced above in bold
and italics. The object and purpose of Transfer Pricing adjustment is to
ensure that the controlled taxpayers are given tax parity with uncontrolled
taxpayers by determining their true taxable income. There should be adequate
and proper compensation for the functions performed including AMP expenses.
Thus, we disagree with the Revenue and do not accept the overbearing and
orotund submission that the exercise to separate ‗routine' and ‗non-routine'
AMP or brand building exercise by applying ‗bright line test' of non-
comparables and in all case, costs or compensation paid for AMP expenses would
be ‗NIL', or at best would mean the amount or compensation expressly paid for
AMP expenses. Unhesitatingly, we add that in a specific case this criteria and
even zero attribution could be possible, but facts should so reveal and
require. To this extent, we would disagree with the majority decision in L.G.
Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. (supra).

Decisions in the case of GlaxoSmithKline and DHL

128\. In respect of GlaxoSmithKline, very little information is available
except that in 1993 an advance pricing agreement was accepted by the IRS and
SmithKline Beecham in respect of sale of certain drugs. Glaxo, was then a
competitor of SmithKline Beecham and was marketing a similar drug. In 1992,
the IRS initiated audit in the case of Glaxo for the years 1989-1990. In 1994,
Glaxo and IRS tried to resolve the dispute through advance pricing agreement,
but were unsuccessful. The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between U.K.
and U.S. was invoked. The dispute, it appears was predicated on IRS's
assertion that advertisement and marketing was more valuable in respect of the
said drug, whereas Glaxo and the U.K. taxing authority believed that the high
transfer price was reasonable because the research and development work was
more valuable. In December, 2000, Glaxo merged with SmithKline Beecham ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 99 of 142 Corporation. As noted above,
SmithKline Beecham had earlier entered into an advance tax agreement with the
IRS in respect of the same drug. The terms of the said advance pricing
agreement were made public. In 2004, the litigation took another turn, when
GlaxoSmithKline sued IRS claiming that they had erred in increasing the
assessed income and sought refund along with interest. The matter was
scheduled for trial, when on 11th September, 2006, IRS and GlaxoSmithKline
announced settlement. GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $ 3.4 billion or 60% of
the total contested amount and dropped their claim for refund. Noticeably,
this was after about 14 years.

129\. The dispute in the case of DHL Corporation, U.S.A. in appeal, was
decided in favour of the assessed. DHL Corporation, U.S.A. was the registered
owner of the trademark and had exclusive right to use and sub-licence DHL
trademark in the United States. U.S. Corporation had entered into a long-term
agreement with a group company, namely Document Handling Limited
International, Hong Kong (‗DHLI', for short) which was responsible for
operations outside the U.S. No royalty was payable to DHL, U.S.

130\. In 1992, a third party consortium in terms of an agreement, exercised
their option to purchase majority stake in DHLI and another group company,
DHLI Middleton, N.V. which owned most of the overseas operating companies. The
said consortium, through a new entity created by them, exercised option to
purchase DHL trademark rights for US$ 20 million. Several questions arose in
the said case including valuation of the trademark rights. One of the
contentious issues related to attribution of the sale consideration paid for
the trademark between DHL, U.S. and DHLI, Hong Kong.

131\. On the question of ownership analysis, the appellate court referred to
the plain language of the then governing ‗1968 Regulations' to observe that
legal ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 100 of 142 ownership was not the
proper test, for the 1968 regulations stipulated that the property would be
treated as owned by the controlled taxpayer that had borne the greatest share
of the cost of development. Thus, the 1968 regulations ignored legal ownership
in favour of economic ownership. The ‗1994 Regulations' superseded the
aforesaid effect. Applying the concept of developer-assister rule to the
factual matrix, it was observed that DHLI Hong Kong had incurred cost and risk
for development of intangibles. Thus, DHLI Hong Kong had the status of a
developer.

132\. These decisions, contrary to the transfer pricing orders, do not assist
or foster Revenue's stand.

Paragraphs 6.36 to 6.39 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

133\. Transfer Pricing Officers have referred to paragraphs 6.36 to 6.39. For
the sake of completeness, we would quote the said paragraphs from the OECD
Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which read:-

> ―6.36 Difficult transfer pricing problems can arise when marketing
> activities are undertaken by enterprises that do not own the trademarks or
> tradenames that they are promoting (such as a distributor of branded goods).
> In such a case, it is necessary to determine how the marketer should be
> compensated for those activities. The issue is whether the marketer should
> be compensated as a service provider, i.e., for providing promotional
> services, or whether there are any cases in which the marketer should share
> in any additional return attributable to the marketing intangibles. A
> related question is how the return attributable to the marketing intangibles
> can be identified.

> 6.37 As regards the first issue- whether the marketer is entitled to a
> return on the marketing intangibles above a normal return on marketing
> activities- the analysis requires an assessment of the obligations and
> rights implied by the agreement between the parties. It will often be the
> case that the return on marketing activities will be sufficient and
> appropriate. One relatively clear case is where a distributor acts merely as
> an agent, being reimbursed for its promotional expenditures by the owner of
> the marketing intangible. In that case, the distributor would be entitled to
> compensation ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 101 of 142 appropriate to
> its agency activities alone and would not be entitled to share in any return
> attributable to the marketing intangible.

> 6.38 Where the distributor actually bears the cost of its marketing
> activities (i.e. there is no arrangement for the owner to reimburse the
> expenditures), the issue is the extent to which the distributor is able to
> share in the potential benefits from those activities. In general, in arm's
> length transactions the ability of a party that is not the legal owner of a
> marketing intangible to obtain the future benefits of marketing activities
> that increase the value of that intangible will depend principally on the
> substance of the rights of that party. For example, a distributor may have
> the ability to obtain benefits from its investments in developing the value
> of a trademark from its turnover and market share where it has a long-term
> contract of sole distribution rights for the trademarked product. In such
> cases, the distributor's share of benefits should be determined based on
> what an independent distributor would obtain in comparable circumstances. In
> some cases, a distributor may bear extraordinary marketing expenditures
> beyond what an independent distributor with similar rights might incur for
> the benefit of its own distribution activities. An independent distributor
> in such a case might obtain an additional return from the owner of the
> trademark, perhaps through a decrease in the purchase price of the product
> or a reduction in royalty rate.

> 6.39 The other question is how the return attributable to marketing
> activities can be identified. A marketing intangible may obtain value as a
> consequence of advertising and other promotional expenditures, which can be
> important to maintain the value of the trademark. However, it can be
> difficult to determine what these expenditures have contributed to the
> success of a product. For instance, it can be difficult to determine what
> advertising and marketing expenditures have contributed to the production or
> revenue, and to what degree. It is also possible that a new trademark or one
> newly introduced into a particular market may have no value or little value
> in that market and its value may change over the years as it makes an
> impression on the market (or perhaps loses its impact). A dominant market
> share may to some extent be attributable to marketing efforts of a
> distributor. The value and any changes will depend to an extent on how
> effectively the trademark is promoted in the particular market. More
> fundamentally, in many cases higher returns derived from the sale of
> trademarked products may be due as much to the unique characteristics of the
> product or its high quality as to the success of advertising and other
> promotional expenditures. The actual conduct of the parties over a period of
> years should be given significant weight in evaluating the return
> attributable to marketing activities. See paragraphs 3.75-3.79 (multiple
> year data).‖ ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 102 of 142

134\. The aforesaid paragraphs do not support the Revenue's submission, but
stipulate the requirement that the owner of the marketing intangible should
adequately compensate the domestic AE incurring costs towards marketing
activities by reimbursement of expenses or by sufficient and appropriate
return. Where the domestic AE is entitled to compensation as a pure
distributor, it would not be entitled to share in any return attributable to
the marketing intangible, not being the legal owner. The position may be
different where there is a long-term contract of sole distribution rights of
the trade marked products, thereby acquiring ―economic ownership‖ benefit. In
some cases, where the distributor bears extraordinary marketing expenses, he
would be entitled to additional or higher return, through decreased price or
reduction of royalty rate. The difficulty in attributing advertisement and
other promotional expenditures towards trademark valuation or towards
marketing activities, i.e. contributing to manufacture and current income and
the impracticability of division in the case of such attribution is
highlighted in paragraph 6.39.

135\. It is, therefore, incorrect to suggest or observe that international tax
jurisprudence or commentaries recognise ―bright line test‖ for bifurcation of
routine and non-routine AMP expenditure, and non-routine AMP expenses is an
independent international transaction which should be separately subjected to
arm's length pricing.

K. Aggregation or Disaggregation of Transactions and Set Off in Segregation of
Bundled Transactions; whether Section 92(3) prohibits segregation.

136\. This leads us to the question of set off when bundled transactions are
segregated. Conceptually, this is justified and equitable, as tax is payable
on the ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 103 of 142 total income after
transfer pricing computation in respect of international transactions (See
Section 92(4) of the Act).

137\. The question of aggregation and disaggregation of transactions when the
TNM Method or even in other methods is sought to be applied, must have
reference to the strength and weaknesses of the TNM Method or the applicable
method. Aggregation of transactions is desirable and not merely permissible,
if the nature of transaction(s) taken as a whole is so inter-related that it
will be more reliable means of determining the arm's length consideration for
the controlled transactions. There are often situations where separate
transactions are intertwined and linked or are continuous that they cannot be
evaluated adequately on separate basis. Secondly, the controlled transaction
should ordinarily be based on the transaction actually undertaken by the AEs
as has been struck by them. We should not be considered as advocating a broad-
brush approach but, a detailed scrutinized ascertainment and determination
whether or not the aggregation or segregation of transactions would be
appropriate and proper while applying the particular Method, is necessary.

138\. The OECD Commentary in this regard is relevant and reproduced below:

> ―3.13 An-intentional set-off is one that associated enterprises incorporate
> knowingly into the terms of the controlled transactions. It occurs when one
> associated enterprise has provided a benefit to another associated
> enterprise within the group that is balanced to some degree by different
> benefits received from that enterprise in return. These enterprises may

> benefit each has provided as full or part payment for those benefits so that

> 3.14 Intentional set-offs may vary in size and complexity. Such set- offs

139\. The majority judgment in the case of L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) opines that the Act, i.e. Chapter X of the Act, prohibits and does not
permit set off or adjustment. Reference stands made to sub-section (3) to
Section 92 of the Act. We would like to reproduce the said Section and
understand the object and purpose behind the said provision.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 105 of 142

―(3) The provisions of this section shall not apply in a case where the
computation of income under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2A) or the
determination of the allowance for any expense or interest under sub- section
(1) or sub-section (2A), or the determination of any cost or expense allocated
or apportioned, or, as the case may be, contributed under sub-section (2) or
sub-section (2A), has the effect of reducing the income chargeable to tax or
increasing the loss, as the case may be, computed on the basis of entries made
in the books of account in respect of the previous year in which the
international transaction or specified domestic transaction was entered into.‖

140\. Sub-section (3), we do not think incorporates a bar or prohibits set
offs or adjustments. It states that Section 92, which refers to computation of
income from international transaction with reference to arm's length price
under sub- section (2) or (2A), would not have the effect of reducing income
chargeable to tax or increase the loss, as the as may be, computed by the
assessee on the basis of entries in the books of account. Income chargeable to
tax or loss as computed in the books is with reference to the previous year.
The effect of sub- section is that the profit or loss declared, i.e. computed
by the assessee on the basis of entries in the books of account shall not be
enhanced or reduced because of transfer pricing adjustments under sub-section
(2) or (2A) to Section

92\. It states the obvious and apparent. In case the assessed has declared
better and more favourable results as per the entries in the books of account,
then the income chargeable to tax or loss shall not be decreased or increased
by reason of Transfer Pricing computation. Thus, transfer pricing adjustments
do not enure to the benefit or advantage the assessed, thereby reducing the
income declared or enhancing the declared loss. Pertinently, the Sub-Section
makes reference to the income chargeable to tax or increase in the loss on the
basis of the entries in the books of account. The concept of set off or
adjustments was/is well recognized and accepted internationally and by the tax
experts/ commentators. In case the legislative intent behind sub-section (3)
to Section 92 was to deny set off, the same would have been spoken about and
asserted in ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 106 of 142 different and
categorical words. Legislative intent to the contrary should not be assumed.

141\. Principle of literal interpretation would be applicable for a Section
must be construed as it reads, without any addition or subtraction.
Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in CIT versus Vatika Township P.
Ltd. [2014] 367 ITR 466, has observed:

> "Tax laws are clearly in derogation of personal rights and property
> interests and are, therefore, subject to strict construction, and any
> ambiguity must be resolved against imposition of the tax. In Billings v. U.
> S, the Supreme Court clearly acknowledged this basic and long- standing rule
> of statutory construction:

> "Tax Statutes ... should be construed, and, if any ambiguity be found to
> exist, it must be resolved in favour of the citizen. Eidman v. Martinez 184
> U.S. 578, 583; ...

> Again in Unites States v. Merriam, the Supreme Court clearly stated at pages
> 187-88:

> "On behalf of the Government it is urged that taxation is a practical matter
> and concerns itself with the substance of the thing upon which the tax is
> imposed, rather than with legal forms or expressions. But, in statutes
> levying taxes, the literal meaning of the words employed is most important,
> for such statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear
> import of the language used. If the words are doubtful, the doubt must be
> resolved against the Government and in favour of the taxpayer. Gould v.
> Gould 245 U.S. 151, 153."

> ASN 51/53 WP-871-14 As Lord Cairns said many years ago in Partington v.
> Attorney-General: As I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it
> is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law
> he must be taxed, however, great the hardship may appear to the judicial
> mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax,
> cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free,
> however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise
> appear to be."

142\. The Legislature, therefore, if it wanted to provide and stipulate that
set off would not be available or should be denied, would have appropriately
expressed their intention in specific and express words. The intention on the
other hand of the Legislature is not what is propounded by the Revenue.
Consistent, the stand ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 107 of 142 of the
Revenue, it is apparent is divergent from the internationally accepted
practice relating to Transfer Pricing determinations. The Legislature when it
wanted to deviate, has adopted such recourse as with the year data and use of
inter-quartile range. We do not read any repugnancy on this aspect in Section
92(3) of the Act. Thus, where the Act, i.e. the Income Tax Act, 1961 or the
Rules do not devise or enact a contrary provision, we should not discard or
ignore, without adequate justification, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
or the U.N. Transfer Pricing Manual. Otherwise we deny ourselves benefit and
advantage of the study and the dexterous and deliberated elucidations made in
the extant OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines or the U.N. Transfer Pricing
Manual, as if they are redundant and superfluous. The Act, i.e. the Income Tax
Act, 1961 and the Rules are supreme, but the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
or the U.N. Transfer Pricing Manual can be supplement and constitute a
valuable and convenient commentary on the subject. They are not binding but
surely their rational and articulacy requires cogitation, if not acceptance,
when warranted.

143\. It may be interesting to reproduce a portion of sub-paragraph (h) of
paragraph 3 of the written submissions filed by the Revenue before us which
reads:

> ―In fact, in a large number of cases the parent companies have reimbursed
> such expenses to Indian entities either by not charging the royalty, by
> subvention or by direct subsidy or by reimbursement of expenses. In the
> light of such glaring facts, the suggestion that the existence of an
> international transaction is being inferred by the revenue by applying some
> mathematical tool is not correct.‖ It should not be understood that we are
> holding or pronouncing our verdict on the basis of the said written
> submissions but we have quoted the aforesaid portion to show that the
> Revenue is conscience and aware of commercial business realities and the
> need to account for set offs. It is commonly ITA 16/2014 & connected matters
> Page 108 of 142 recognized and accepted. The object and purpose behind arm
> length principle is to tax the actual and commercial income which could have
> been earned by the AE in India.

144\. Question of set off would only arise in case two transactions are
separate and arm's length price should be computed separately. It would not
arise for consideration in cases where there are closely linked or continuous
international transactions. Yet, there may be a third category of cases, where
the assessee perceives and files his report in form 92E treating the
international transaction as one or as continuous or an interconnected
package, but the Revenue perceives and believes that the transaction is not
one, but should be segregated for the purpose of computation of arm's length
price. For the present reasoning, we will assume and accept that the position
of the Revenue is correct and the ‗aggregation' made by the assessee is wrong.
In such cases, it would be grossly unfair and inequitable not to apportion or
segregate the transactions as declared in a reasonable and logical manner. It
would be conspicuously wrong and incorrect to treat the segregated
transactional value as ‗NIL' when in fact the two AEs had treated the
international transactions as a package or a single one and contribution is
attributed to the aggregate package. It is noticeable that sub- section (3) to
Section 92 does not make reference to the computation of the form 92E but
makes reference to the books of account and computation on the basis of the
entries in the books of account. It stipulates that the computation made under
sub-section (2) or (2A) shall not have effect of reducing the income or
increasing the losses as declared on the basis of the said entries. Income or
loss is the net figure which is computed after taking into account the
business activities undertaken by the assessed AE which will have reference to
the declared bundled/packaged international transaction.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 109 of 142

145\. In the impugned decision, the majority decision has observed that there
is no basis for a presumption that the international arm's length price of one
transaction was lower and this position has to be proved de hors the overall
net profit rate. It should be proved by the assessed by comparison with what
was charged for similar goods supplied by other independent enterprises
dealing with India. We with respect have reservation and do not agree with the
commanding universal affirmative approach. This may be relevant in a given
case if the arm's length price is computed transaction by transaction and not
as a bundle. Albeit, net profit rate in TNM Method may be indicative, or in a
given case, sufficient proof of adequate compensation. Onus would be on the
assessed, but the relevant facts must be ascertained. The use of the
expression ‗special circumstances' etc. in the majority decision is
unacceptable. In fact, there cannot be any assumption against the assessed
when arm's length price by applying the TNM Method is accepted, to discern and
infer that the purchase price did not account and did not subsume the AMP
expenses incurred by the Indian AE.

146\. Whether higher net profit rate would indicate lower or reduced purchase
price, we observe is a question of fact and not law. Subsidy paid could
account for the bundled transaction, including the entire set of transactions
included. The final finding should be reasoned and analytical. It should be
sound as per mathematical and accountancy principles. In case of a package or
bunched transaction, this would require forthright and rigorous examination.
If bifurcation is legitimate and mandated, apportionment should proceed on
accurate and punctilious manner which is fair and reasonable. When the
Assessing Officer / the TPO bifurcates or segregates the packaged transaction
as declared by the assessed, he must conduct the exercise, rationally and
objectively.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 110 of 142

CIT versus EKL Appliances Ltd - Disregarding actual transaction

147\. Tax authorities examine a related and associated parties' transaction as
actually undertaken and structured by the parties. Normally, tax authorities
cannot disregard the actual transaction or substitute the same for another
transaction as per their perception. Restructuring of legitimate business
transaction would be an arbitrary exercise. This legal position stands
affirmed in EKL Appliances Ltd. (supra). The decision accepts two exceptions
to the said rule. The first being where the economic substance of the
transaction differs from its form. In such cases, the tax authorities may
disregard the parties' characterisation of the transaction and re-characterise
the same in accordance with its substance. The Tribunal has not invoked the
said exception, but the second exception, i.e. when the form and substance of
the transaction are the same, but the arrangements made in relation to the
transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have
been adopted by the independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational
manner. The second exception also mandates that actual structure should
practically impede the tax authorities from determining an appropriate
transfer price. The majority judgment does not record the second condition and
holds that in their considered opinion, the second exception governs the
instant situation as per which, the form and substance of the transaction were
the same but the arrangements made in relation to a transaction, when viewed
in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by an
independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. The
aforesaid observations were recorded in the light of the fact in the case of
L.G. Electronics (supra). Commenting on the factual matrix of L.G. Electronics
case (supra) would be beyond our domain; however, we do not find any factual
finding to this effect by the TPO or the Tribunal in any of the present cases.
However, in L.G.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 111 of 142

Electronics decision (supra), it is observed that if the AMP expenses and when
such expenses are beyond the bright line, the transaction viewed in their
totality would differ from one which would have been adopted by an independent
enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. No reason or ground for
holding or the ratio, is indicated or stated. There is no material or
justification to hold that no independent party would incur the AMP expenses
beyond the bright line AMP expenses. Free market conditions would indicate and
suggest that an independent third party would be willing to incur heavy and
substantial AMP expenses, if he presumes this is beneficial, and he is
adequately compensated. The compensation or the rate of return would depend
upon whether it is a case of long-term or short-term association and market
conditions, turnover and ironically international or worldwide brand value of
the intangibles by the third party.

148\. There is no material or data on record to show that an independent
enterprise acting in a commercially rational manner would not enter into an
agreement for distribution and marketing as has been entered into by the
Indian assessee, a subsidiary of the foreign AE. It would be incongruous and
presumptuous to hold, without any data or good reason, that the transactions
for distribution and marketing as a package are not executed between a foreign
enterprise and an independent enterprise. The ―bright line test‖ we hasten to
reiterate is not and cannot be the criteria, reason or data. Commercial men
would seek appropriate margins to incur AMP expenses and yet earn net profit
as per market conditions.

149\. The concept of re-categorisation of transaction is not identical or
similar to aggregation or segregation of transactions. Re-categorisation of
transaction is a different exercise and would result in re-categorisation of
the functions and, therefore, accordingly the comparables. A simple example of
re-categorisation ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 112 of 142 would be
cases of ―thin capitalisation‖. Aggregation or segregation of transactions
accepts that the transactions per se do not require re-categorisation of
transactions. However, in a given case when there is re-categorisation of
transaction, as a consequence, segregation or aggregation may be required.
However, the two aspects/principles prevail and operate in their own field.

L. Economic Ownership

150\. Value of tangible property may be affected by the value of intangible
property, such as trademark affixed on the tangible property. Transfer of
tangible property with embedded intangible property normally is not considered
a transfer of such intangible particularly when the controlled purchasers do
not acquire any right to exploit the intangible property other than the right
to re-sell the tangible property with embedded or affixed intangible rights.
However, while computing the arm's length price, the cost or value of the
embedded intangible would be relevant when the comparability test is adopted
and applied between the controlled transaction with the uncontrolled
transactions.

151\. Economic ownership of a trade name or trade mark is accepted in
international taxation as one of the components or aspects for determining
transfer pricing. Economic ownership would only arise in cases of long-term
contracts and where there is no negative stipulation denying economic
ownership. Economic ownership when pleaded can be accepted if it is proved by
the assessed. The burden is on the assessed. It cannot be assumed. It would
affect and have consequences, when there is transfer or termination of
economic ownership of the brand or trademark.

152\. Determination whether the arrangement is long-term with economic
ownership or short-term should be ordinarily based upon the conditions
existing at the start of the arrangement and not whether the contract is
subsequently ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 113 of 142 renewed. However,
it is open to the party, i.e. the assessed, to place evidence including
affirmation from the brand owner AE that at the start of the arrangement it
was accepted and agreed that the contract would be renewed.

153\. Economic ownership of a brand is an intangible asset, just as legal
ownership. Undifferentiated, economic ownership brand valuation is not done
from moment to moment but would be mandated and required if the assessed is
deprived, denied or transfers economic ownership. This can happen upon
termination of the distribution-cum-marketing agreement or when economic
ownership gets transferred to a third party. Transfer Pricing valuation,
therefore, would be mandated at that time. The international transaction could
then be made a subject matter of transfer pricing and subjected to tax.

154\. Brand or trademark value is paid for, in case of sale of the brand or
otherwise by way of merger or acquisition with third parties. Revenue in
paragraph 8.9 of the written submissions have referred to acquisition of brand
name ‗Reebok' by ‗Adidas' and asserted that the entire benefit was reaped by
the parent entity and not by Reebok India Company Ltd.. Re-organisation, sale
and transfer of a brand as a result of merger and acquisition or sale is not
directly a subject matter of these appeals. As noted above, in a given case
where the Indian AE claims economic ownership of the brand and is deprived or
transfers the said economic ownership, consequences would flow and it may
require transfer pricing assessment. In the written submissions filed by Sony
India Private Limited, they have accepted the said position and stated as
under:-

> ―7.8 Two inferences are therefore inevitable- till a brand gets terminated,
> transferred or sold, its value is measured only in terms of the market share
> or sales turnover. At the time of the sale, in certain circumstances it
> becomes an independent standalone transfer of an intangible right commanding
> a separate value or consideration. As a result of which:

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 114 of 142

7.8.1 The commercial benefit of advertisement or marketing accrues to the
appellant/the tested party in India for having promoted the sale of the
products in India. Income-tax Act recognises this and therefore allows it as a
revenue expense wholly and exclusively expended for the purposes of the
business, the said issue has also been upheld by this court in the case of
Agra beverages Corporation (P) Ltd vs. CIT [2011] 11 taxmann.com 350 (Refer
Page no. 284 of the paperbook).‖ M. Decision in the case of Maruti Suzuki and
the order of the Supreme Court

155\. With respect, the majority judgment of the Tribunal has not appreciated
the effect of the order passed by the Supreme Court on appeal in the case of
Maruti Suzuki. The order passed by the Supreme Court a short one, reads:

> ―Leave granted.

> By consent, the matter is taken up for hearing.

> In this case, the High Court has remitted the matter to the Transfer Pricing
> Officer [‗TPO', for short] with liberty to issue fresh show- cause notice.
> The High Court has further directed the TPO to decide the matter in
> accordance with law. Further, on going through the impugned judgement of the
> High Court dated 1st July, 2010, we find that the High Court has not merely
> set aside the original show-cause notice but it has made certain
> observations on the merits of the case and has given directions to the TPO,
> which virtually concludes the matter. In the circumstances, on that limited
> issue, we hereby direct the TPO, who, in the meantime, has already issued a
> show-cause notice on 16th September, 2010, to proceed with the matter in
> accordance with law uninfluenced by the observations/directions given by the
> High Court in the impugned judgement dated 1st July, 2010.

> The TPO will decide this matter on or before 31st December, 2010.

> The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of with no order as to costs.‖

156\. A Division Bench of Delhi High Court in the writ petition challenging
the Transfer Pricing Order had dealt with transfer pricing issues and had
enrolled and culled out legal ratios and principles. Directions were issued.
At the same time, an order of remand to the TPO to compute the arm's ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 115 of 142 length price on the basis of said
principles was passed. It would not be correct to hold that the Supreme Court
had accepted and had given seal of approval and not interfered with the
principles/ratio enunciated in the judgment by the Delhi High Court. The
Supreme Court as is lucid did not want to examine the principles or ratio as
enunciated and express their opinion on merits, though the directions issued
by the High Court, it was observed, ―conclude the matter‖. The Supreme Court
perceived and accepted that the ‗issue' of arm's length price should be re-
examined by the TPO without being curtailed or restrained by the legal
principles/ratio delineated. As the Supreme Court itself was not examining the
principles/ratio on merits, it did not pass any order in favour or against the
assessee or the Revenue. Accordingly, the aforesaid observations. The effect
thereof was that the judgment of the Delhi High Court would not operate as res
judicata between the parties and merits, if required, would be examined and
gone into in the appellate proceedings. The majority judgment has incorrectly
inferred that the legal principles and directions issued by the Delhi High
Court would continue to be binding decidendi and had attained finality, viz.
the tax authorities and the Tribunal. It is not so indicated. If the legal
principles/ratio was not binding on the writ petitioner, i.e. the assessed in
the said case, it would be malapropos and inappropriate to treat the
directions as binding ratio, in respect of third parties. Therefore, we have
not treated the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of Maruti Suzuki
Ltd. (supra) as a binding precedent. Importantly, the Revenue has relied upon
the final conclusions as recorded and the assessed have relied upon the
earlier portions of the judgment. We have considered the reasoning given in
the aforesaid decision and have reached our own conclusion.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 116 of 142

N. Resale Price Method

157\. We begin by reproducing Rule 10B(1)(b) of the Rules:-

> "Determination of arm's length price under section 92C. 10B. (1) For the
> purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's length price in
> relation to an international transaction or a specified domestic transaction
> shall be determined by any of the following methods, being the most
> appropriate method, in the following manner, namely :--

> (a) xxx

> (b) Resale Price Method, by which,--

> (i) the price at which property purchased or services obtained by the
> enterprise from an associated enterprise is resold or are provided to an
> unrelated enterprise, is identified;

> (ii) such resale price is reduced by the amount of a normal gross profit
> margin accruing to the enterprise or to an unrelated enterprise from the
> purchase and resale of the same or similar property or from obtaining and
> providing the same or similar services, in a comparable uncontrolled
> transaction, or a number of such transactions;

> (iii) the price so arrived at is further reduced by the expenses incurred by
> the enterprise in connection with the purchase of property or obtaining of
> services;

> (iv) the price so arrived at is adjusted to take into account the functional
> and other differences, including differences in accounting practices, if
> any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic
> transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the
> enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect
> the amount of gross profit margin in the open market;

> (v) the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (iv) is taken to be an
> arm's length price in respect of the purchase of the property or obtaining
> of the services by the enterprise from the associated enterprise;

> xxx‖

158\. RP Method as an axiom, the United Nations' Manual exposits:

> ―6.2.6.3. Consequently, under the RPM the starting point of the analysis for
> using the method is the sales company. Under this method the transfer price
> for the sale of products between the sales company (i.e. Associated
> Enterprise 2) and a related company (i.e. Associated Enterprise 1) can be
> described in the following formula: TP = RSP x (1-GPM), where:

>  TP = the Transfer Price of a product sold between a sales company and a
> related company;

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 117 of 142

>  RSP = the Resale Price at which a product is sold by a sales company to
> unrelated customers; and  GPM = the Gross Profit Margin that a specific
> sales company should earn, defined as the ratio of gross profit to net
> sales. Gross profit is defined as Net Sales minus Cost of Goods Sold.‖

159\. RP Method, i.e. the Resale Price Method computes the arm's length price
by ascertaining or identifying the price at which the product is resold by the
AE to an independent enterprise. From this price, the amount of gross profit
margin accruing to the AE or to an unrelated enterprise, i.e. comparable, is
subtracted. The comparable should be engaged in purchase and re-sale of same
or similar property and/or obtaining or providing similar services. From this
amount, the expenses incurred by the AE in connection with the purchase of
property or obtaining of services are further subtracted. At the fourth stage,
adjustments are made taking into account the functional and other differences,
including the accountancy practices, if any, between the tested international
transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions to the extent they
would materially affect the gross profit margins in the open market. The price
computed after the two reductions and after the adjustment on account of the
functional and other differences, determines the arm's length price of the
purchased property or services obtained by the assessed from the AE.

160\. RP Method postulates reverse calculation, as it first requires
identification and ascertainment of resale price, then reductions and
adjustment. It hypothesises ascertainment of normal gross profit margins of
comparables including, if required, adjustment on account of functional and
other differences with comparables. Uncontrolled transaction is comparable
with the controlled transaction for the purpose of RP Method, only if two
conditions are satisfied: that there is no difference between the functions,
which would materially affect the normal gross profit margins in the open
market; and reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate material
effect of such differences. RP ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 118 of 142
Method may require fewer adjustments on account of product differences in
comparison to the CUP Method, i.e. Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method
because minor product differences are less likely to have material effect on
the profit margins as they do on the price. Compensation for performing
similar functions tends to equalise across different activities, whereas in
case of products, the equalisation is normally possible to the extent that
products are substitute for each other. Nevertheless, similarity of the
property as transferred in the controlled transaction for closer comparability
of products/services would produce more accurate results. Sometimes, RP Method
is adopted as more accurate or best method where controlled and uncontrolled
transactions are comparable in all characteristic, other than the product
itself. In some cases, it may be a preferable and more reliable method in
comparison to the CUP Method or CP Method. However, RP Method has its
weaknesses. It loses its accuracy and reliability where the reseller adds
substantially to the value of the product or the goods are further processed
or incorporated into a more sophisticated product or when the product/service
is transformed. In the OECD Commentary on Transfer Pricing Guidelines it has
been observed:

> ― ... Another example where the resale price margin requires particular care
> is where the reseller contributes substantially to the creation or
> maintenance of intangible property associated with the product (e.g.
> trademarks or trade names) which are owned by an associated enterprise. In
> such cases, the contribution of the goods originally transferred to the
> value of the final product cannot be easily evaluated.

> 2.30 A resale price margin is more accurate where it is realised within a
> short time of the reseller's purchase of the goods. The more time that
> elapses between the original purchase and resale, the more likely it is that
> other factors -- changes in the market; in rates of exchange; in costs etc.
> -- will need to be taken into account in any comparison.

> 2.31 It should be expected that the amount of the resale price margin be
> influenced by the level of activities performed by the reseller. This level

> takes on the full risk of ownership together with the full responsibility
> for and the risks involved in advertising, marketing, distributing and
> guaranteeing the goods, financing stocks, and other connected services. If
> the reseller in the controlled transaction does not carry on a substantial
> commercial activity, but only transfers the goods to a third party, the ITA
> 16/2014 & connected matters Page 119 of 142 resale price margin could, in
> light of the functions performed, be a small one. The resale price margin
> could be higher where it can be demonstrated that the reseller has some

> unreasonably high; for example, when part or most of the promotional
> expenditure was clearly incurred as a service performed in favour of the
> legal owner of the trademark. In such\a case the Cost Plus method may well
> supplement the RP Method.‖

161\. The United Nations' Manual on RP Method highlights that this method is
based upon arm's length gross profits, rather than directly determining arm's
length prices. As compared to CUP Method, RP Method requires less direct
transactional (product) comparability than CUP Method. However, there must be
functional comparability. A similar level of compensation is expected for
performing similar functions across different activities. This uniformity and
similitude is necessary because similar gross profits are being compared. If
there are material differences that reflect in the gross profit margins
between the controlled and uncontrolled transaction, adjustments should be
possible on account of such differences. Functions performed can be simple and
cover a limited field of sales, general or administrative expenses; to more
complex one, adding substantially to the gross profit margins. The latter may
happen if the reseller adds substantially to the value of the product by
assisting considerably in creation and maintenance of intangible products or
where the goods are further processed into a more valuable or complicated
product. Referring to the weaknesses of the said method, the commentary
states:-

> ―The method can be used without forcing distributors to inappropriately
> ―make profits‖. The distributor earns an arm's length gross profit margin,
> however, but could have operating losses due, for example, to high selling
> expenses caused by business strategies such as a market penetration
> strategy. By comparison, the application of the Transactional Net Margin
> Method, which analyses a financial ratio based on operating profits, will
> generally result in an arm's length range of positive operating profits. The
> tested party in the analysis would then probably also earn a positive
> operating profit within the range. However, the Resale Price Method does not
> necessarily result in positive operating profits to be earned by the tested
> party.

162\. In the case of Reebok India Co. Ltd., the assessee has applied RS Method
using internal comparable. Contrary to the general rule, the internal
comparable possibly may not be appropriate when the assessed has incurred
considerable (not necessarily extra-ordinary or non-routine) AMP expenses. The
reason is obvious; there is no comparability analysis possible. In such cases,
it is not possible to examine and compare the functional comparability between
the controlled tested transaction and uncontrolled internal party transaction
on account of AMP expenses. Internal comparable would not account for the
credible gross profit rate, which an AE should be ensured when it incurs AMP
expenses. Functionally the comparable is merely a manufacturer and thus, the
said function is compared. AMP expenses do not get factored and compared. As
an abundant caution, we would still add that where adjustments clause (iv) can
give reliable and accurate results, internal comparables could still be
applied. This would likely happen, when AMP expenses are insignificant in
quantum.

163\. Thus, in such cases, external comparables where said parties are
performing similar functions including AMP expenses would give more accurate
and precise results.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 121 of 142

164\. However, it would be wrong to assert and accept that gross profit
margins would not inevitably include cost of AMP expenses. The gross profit
margins could remunerate an AE performing marketing and selling function. This
has to be tested and examined without any assumption against the assessed. A
finding on the said aspect would require detailed verification and
ascertainment.

165\. An external comparable should perform similar AMP functions. Similarly
the comparable should not be the legal owner of the brand name, trade mark
etc. In case a comparable does not perform AMP functions in the marketing
operations, a function which is performed by the tested party, the comparable
may have to be discarded. Comparable analysis of the tested party and the
comparable would include reference to AMP expenses. In case of a mismatch,
adjustment could be made when the result would be reliable and accurate.
Otherwise, RP Method should not be adopted. If on comparable analysis,
including AMP expenses, gross profit margins match or are within the specified
range, no transfer pricing adjustment is required. In such cases, the gross
profit margin would include the margin or compensation for the AMP expenses
incurred. Routine or non-routine AMP expenses would not materially and
substantially affect the gross profit margins when the tested party and the
comparable undertake similar AMP functions.

166\. On behalf of the assessee, it was initially argued that the TPO cannot
account for or treat AMP as a function. This argument on behalf of the
assessee is flawed and fallacious for several reasons. There are inherent
flaws in the said argument. Moreover, the contention of the assessed in these
appeals would mandate rejection of the RP Method, as an appropriate or most
appropriate method. Comparison or comparative analysis is undertaken at stage
(ii). Adjustments are permissible and undertaken at stage (iv). Under clause
(iii), i.e. at stage (iii), from the price ascertained at stage (ii), expenses
incurred by the ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 122 of 142 enterprise in
connection with the purchase of property or obtaining of services is reduced.
Under clause (iv), adjustments have to be made on account of functional
difference which would include assets used and risk assumed. It is at stage
(iv) of the RP Method that the Assessing Officer/TPO can make adjustments if
he finds that an assessee has incurred substantial AMP expenses in comparison
to the comparables. Once adjustments are made, then the appropriate arm's
length price can be determined. In case, it is not possible to make
adjustments, then RP Method may not be the most appropriate and best method to
be adopted.

167\. Before us, the Revenue has not pleaded or submitted that the RP Method
should not have been adopted. The TPO and the Assessing Officer did not reject
the RP Method adopted by the assessee. The assessed submit that the Revenue
accepts functional parity and in fact, without adjustment. Contra, Revenue
would argue that the Assessing Officer/TPO and the Tribunal have adopted and
applied the CUP Method for determining arm's length price of AMP expenses. We
do not pronounce a firm and final opinion on the said lis as it should be at
first examined by the Tribunal.

168\. The Tribunal has upheld adoption of CP Method after applying ‗bright
line test' in the case of Reebok India Co. Ltd. and Canon India Pvt. Ltd. The
‗bright line test' adopted to demarcate the routine and non-routine AMP
expenditure is predicated on selection of a domestic distributor and marketing
company that does not own intangible brand rights. Contract value would be
treated as NIL. In terms of our finding recorded above, the said finding would
not be correct. The approach and procedure for ascertaining /determining arm's
length price under the RP Method is different. For this reason, and other
grounds recorded, we have passed an order of remit to the Tribunal for
examination of the factual matrix.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 123 of 142

O. Cost Plus Method

169\. CP Method as stipulated in Rule 10B (1)(c) is as under:

> "10B. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arms
> length price in relation to an international transaction shall be determined
> by any of the following methods, being the most appropriate method, in the
> following manner, namely :

> xxx

> (c) cost plus method, by which,

> (i) the direct and indirect costs of production incurred by the enterprise
> in respect of property transferred or services provided to an associated
> enterprise, are determined;

> (ii) the amount of a normal gross profit mark-up to such costs (computed
> according to the same accounting norms) arising from the transfer or
> provision of the same or similar property or services by the enterprise, or
> by an unrelated enterprise, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a
> number of such transactions, is determined;

> (iii) the normal gross profit mark-up referred to in sub-clause (ii) is
> adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, if any,
> between the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled
> transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions,
> which could materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market;

> (iv) the costs referred to in sub-clause (i) are increased by the adjusted
> profit mark-up arrived at under sub-clause (iii);

> (v) the sum so arrived at is taken to be an arm's length price in relation
> to the supply of the property or provision of services by the enterprise;‖

170\. United Nations' Manual in arithmetic terms has elucidated CP Method in
the following manner:

> ―The formula for the transfer price in inter-company transactions of
> products is as follows: TP = COGS x (1 + cost plus markup), where:

> > TP = the Transfer Price of a product sold between a manufacturing company
> and a related company;

> COGS = the Cost of Goods Sold to the manufacturing company; and ITA 16/2014
> & connected matters Page 124 of 142 > Cost plus mark-up = gross profit mark-
> up defined as the ratio of gross profit to cost of goods sold. Gross profit
> is defined as sales minus cost of goods sold.‖ The said method is strictly
> applied to manufacturing or assembling activities or relatively simple
> service providers. Like RP Method, CP Method is a gross margin method as it
> attempts to derive the arm's length price on a mark-up of cost of goods or
> services provided.

171\. Determination of cost or expense can cause difficulties in applying CP
Method. Careful consideration should be given, what would constitute cost i.e.
what should be included or excluded from cost. A studied scrutiny of CP Method
would indicate that when the said Method is applied by treating AMP expenses
as an independent transaction, it would not make any difference whether the
same are routine or non-routine, once functional comparability with or without
adjustment is accepted. The gross profit of the comparable is applied and
accepted, when there is no difference between the AMP and other functions
being compared that would materially affect the gross profit mark up or when
reasonably accurate adjustments can be performed. Thus, CP Method requires
functional comparability. This comparability analysis would necessarily imply
that the comparable must and should be performing similar functions, including
the nature of costs and expenses incurred. If the discounts/incentives and for
that matter entire distribution and marketing expenses are treated as costs,
functional and comparable analysis comparison should be similar. Thus, the
entire cost, i.e. marketing expense or distribution and marketing expense, can
be made subject matter and included in ‗cost', for determining arm's length
price by applying CP Method.

172\. The United Nations' Manual discourages application of CP Method in
transactions involving full-fledged manufacturer who owns valuable product
intangibles i.e. a manufacturer who has incurred considerable cost on Research
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 125 of 142 & Development, patent,
technology etc. for the reason that it is difficult to locate a similar
independent manufacturer owning comparable. There is no finding or examination
on this aspect by the Tribunal. We caution, the reference above is to valuable
product intangibles and not marketing intangibles. The assessed rely upon AEs
valuable product intangibles. The issue can be answered after ascertaining
facts and whether similar comparables are available. We have not pronounced a
firm opinion. Obviously, the aforesaid caveat would not arise if and when, AMP
as a transaction is separately benchmarked and tested.

173\. This task of arm's length pricing in the case of tested party may become
difficult when a number of transactions are interconnected and compensated but
a transaction is bifurcated and segregated. Allocation of price or
compensation paid would be a contentious question and apportionment must be
justified and fair. CP Method, when applied to the segregated transaction,
must pass the criteria of most appropriate method. If and when such
determination of gross profit with reference to AMP transaction is required,
it must be undertaken in a fair, objective and reasonable manner.

174\. Costs or expenses incurred for services provided or in respect of
property transferred, when made subject matter of arm's length price by
applying CP Method, cannot be again factored or included as a part of inter-
connected international transaction and subjected to arm's length pricing.
This situation would possibly result in over, if not double taxation, contrary
to the object and purpose of arm's length pricing, which is to tax the real
income after correcting the negative impact, if any, of the controlled
conditions. Therefore, if entire marketing and distribution expenses, or
marketing or AMP expenses are bench marked under CP Method, then it would be
injudicious and irrational to apply any other method to compute the arm's
length price of a larger composite ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 126 of
142 international transaction, of which the said costs and expenses form only
a part. Logically, if the costs or expenses as a function are excluded or
included in the cost while computing the arm's length price under the CP
Method, the gross profit as a result of such transaction would be lower or
higher. This situation would be different from subjecting the same
international transaction to arm's length pricing by two different methods,
which is permissible, in the manner stipulated in the first Proviso to Section
92C of the Act.

P. Direct Marketing Expenses

175\. The argument of the Revenue on direct marketing expenses is as under:-

> ―1. Special Bench of the ITAT has decided in the case of LG Electronics
> India Pvt. Ltd. that selling expenses such as discounts and
> incentives/pricing adjustments should not be considered as part of AMP
> expenses. The argument against their inclusion in AMP expenses is that these
> expenses are nothing but a reduction in the price of product and do not
> create any marketing intangible.

> 2\. The objective of the AMP activities is not to merely advertise the brand
> to the ultimate customers. It is also to make the brand popular to the
> dealers who will eventually push the ‗XX' brand over other brands in the
> market. Only when a reasonable amount of brand loyalty is built up among the
> dealers, the entire circle of AMP activities will be complete. The discounts
> and incentives that the assessing is passing on to the dealers is the tool
> that it employs to create this brand loyalty among them. Once they are
> convinced that this company is passing on a greater benefit to them only

176\. The aforesaid argument, when AMP expenses are segregated from the
composite transaction including distribution and marketing function, is flawed
and has to be rejected. The respondent-assessees are engaged in distribution
and marketing of consumer goods. Distribution and marketing exercise in case
of tangibles requires transfer/sale of goods to third parties, be it sub-
distributors or retailers. The said transaction is in the nature of sale of
goods for consideration. The marketing or selling expenses like trade
discounts, volume discounts, etc. offered to sub-distributors or retailers are
not in the nature and character of ―brand promotion‖. They are not directly or
immediately related to ―brand building‖ exercise, but have a live link and
direct connect with marketing and increased volume of sales or turnover. The
brand building connect is too remote and faint. To include and treat the
direct marketing expenses like trade or volume discount or incentive as ―brand
building‖ exercise would be contrary to common sense and would be highly
exaggerated. These reduce the net profit margin. It would lead to abnormal
financial results defying accountancy practices and commercial and business
sense. The expenses being in the nature of selling expenses have an immediate
connect with price/consideration payable for the goods sold. They are not
incurred for publicity or advertisement. Direct marketing and sale related
expenses or discounts/concessions would not form part of the AMP expenses.

177\. In the present case, neither the assessed nor the Assessing Officer/TPO
has adopted CUP Method for determination of arm's length price. TNM Method or
RP Method has been adopted and accepted as the most appropriate method. TNM
Method, as noticed above, obligates analysis of profit and loss account and
the test is benchmarking of operating profits with the relevant PLI ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 128 of 142 and comparison with reference to
the comparable. Discount and incentives offered, reduce the operating profits
and, therefore, the benchmarking exercise with comparables, reflects and
accounts for the same. We have examined the impact and consequences of
applying CP Method, by factoring and treating AMP expenses and trade discounts
and incentives as an independent international transaction, when we continue
to treat the said expenses as a component of a packaged international
transaction, which is separately benchmarked. This would not lead us to
accurate and reliable results. There is need and requirement to check over or
double taxation.

178\. The prime lending rate cannot be the basis for computing mark-up under
Rule 10B(1)(c) of the Rules, as the case set up by the Revenue pertains to
mark- up on AMP expenses as an international transaction. Mark up as per sub-
clause

(ii) to Rule 10B(1)(c) would be comparable gross profit on the cost or
expenses incurred as AMP. The mark-up has to be benchmarked with comparable
uncontrolled transactions or transactions for providing similar
service/product. The Revenue's stand in some cases applying the prime lending
rate fixed by the Reserve Bank of India with a further mark-up, is mistaken
and unfounded. Interest rate mark-up would apply to international transactions
granting/ availing loans, advances, etc. Q. Arm's Length Price of royalty paid
by Reebok India Company Ltd (ITA No.213/2014

179\. We now proceed to examine and answer, the question raised by the Revenue
in the appeal filed against Reebok India Company Ltd.

180\. Royalty of Rs.15,28,77,527/- paid to Reebok International Ltd., U.K.,
was benchmarked by the assessed using CUP Method as the most appropriate
method. Royalty paid by Sierra Industrial Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. to Nike ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 129 of 142 International Ltd. USA @ 5% was
taken as a valid comparable. In addition, the assessed relied upon Foreign
Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000 authorising
remission of royalty of upto 5% on domestic sales and upto 8% on exports under
the automatic route to foreign technical collaborators. The TPO rejecting the
claim, observed that the assessed had not established cost-benefit analysis
for payment of royalty. No such exercise had been carried out. The TPO
referred to technology licence agreement dated 1st October, 2002 between the
assessee and Reebok International Ltd., U.K. for providing data,
documentation, drawings and specifications relating to inventions, designs,
formulae, processes and similar properties, referred to as know-how and the
non-exclusive, non-transferable right granted to utilize the technology to
manufacture and distribute Reebok products in India. He referred to the
profitability data of the assessed and observed that the technology and
payment of royalty was not reflected in the profit margins or commensurate
benefit. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that no independent enterprise
would make payments for royalty which were not contributing to its
profitability. The profitability data relied upon by the Assessing Officer
reads as under:

> ― F.Ys. 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 Sales (WSP) 252.5 366.2 451.23 Royalty 6.82
> 9.62 15.29 Net Profit 17.76 32.81 33.34 Net Profit/Sales 7.03% 8.96% 7.4% ‖

181\. The TPO accordingly determined the arm's length price of royalty as
‗NIL' in place on Rs.15,28,77,527/- under CUP Method. The DRP affirmed the
action of the TPO and consequently, an assessment order holding that the arm's
length price of the royalty was ‗NIL', in place of controlled transaction
value of Rs.15,28,77,527/-, was passed.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 130 of 142

182\. The Tribunal in the impugned order while allowing the appeal, has
referred to the technology and know-how furnished in the form of ‗PUMP'
technology, ‗DMX' technology and ‗3D Ultralite' technology. New products were
designed and developed after research and development at the Research &
Development and Product Creation Centre in Canton, USA. These patented
technologies were used in local development and manufacturing process for
footwear and apparels. The entire business of the assessee in India was
dependent upon the patented technology provided by the AE which could not have
been used without licence/permission. Total revenue of the assessed had
increased to Rs.451.97 crores from Rs.360.95 crores in the previous year,
registering a growth of 25.21%. The technology was required to survive and
grow in a competitive industry where continuous innovation was a pre-
requisite. The Tribunal observed that payment of royalty was treated as a bona
fide expenditure in the earlier years and it was an undisputed position that
know- how or technical information had been provided under the licence
agreement.

183\. On the question whether the royalty should have been paid or not, we are
in agreement with the finding of the Tribunal that question of payment of
royalty cannot be determined on the basis of profitability or earnings of the
assessed, once it is accepted that know-how and technical information was
provided. It is not alleged or the case of the Revenue that the technology or
know-how was hopeless and useless. The finding of the Assessing Officer/TPO,
that the assessee had not derived any commercial benefit as technology and
know-how had not resulted in any substantial profit increase, has been rightly
rejected as totally unsustainable. Profitability of the assessed could have
been lower or varied due to various reasons and lower profitability in one or
more years cannot lead to the conclusion that no benefits were derived or
technology was unproductive. The justification given by the assessee for ITA
16/2014 & connected matters Page 131 of 142 lower profits on account of bad
debts, high rent, increase in legal cost stand highlighted and accepted by the
Tribunal.

184\. Transfer pricing provisions, as noted above, recognise separate entity
principle. Therefore, as a sequitur, it follows that the AE is a separate
entity and when it avails and secures advantage of technical know-how, it
should pay arm's length price for the right to use. The arm's length price
would be the fair market price of the technical know-how, which is licensed.

185\. Royalty payable for availing the right to use would depend upon
corresponding price, which would have been paid by an independent or unrelated
enterprise. This is judged by applying comparables. TPO has not rejected the
quantum of royalty on the said principle. The reasoning given by the TPO is
not only erroneous for the reasons stated above, but is also contrary to the
Rules. Depending upon the method selected, net profit or gross profit of the
assessed has to be compared with profit margins of related enterprise. The
formula prescribed under the Rules does not accept the ratiocination adopted
and applied by the TPO.

186\. A similar controversy had arisen before the Delhi High Court in EKL
Appliances Limited, (supra). The assessed in the said case was incurring
losses and on this pretext, the TPO had disallowed the entire brand fee or
royalty. The Tribunal disagreed with the Revenue. The appeal filed by the
Revenue was dismissed stating that the considerations relied by the TPO were
irrelevant considerations for the purpose of Rule 10B. The Division Bench of
this Court rejected the argument that financial health of the assessee alone
would determine whether or not the transfer price paid was appropriate and the
fair market value. This would be an extraneous consideration for disallowing
the whole expenditure, when technology was required and provided. Opinion of
ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 132 of 142 the assessed matters. The
transfer pricing regulations permit examination of the international
transaction and suitable adjustments. It would be a different matter if it is
established that an independent entity, in the given prevailing circumstances,
would not have entered into the said transaction with the AE. This is not the
case set up by the Revenue. The assessed in the present case has made profits.

187\. The Tribunal in the impugned order, therefore, had rightly applied the
test of commercial expediency and has recorded that the assessed was free to
conduct business in the manner it deems fit. We hasten to add that two
exceptions have been carved out in the case of EKL Appliances Limited (supra),
but the exceptions have not been invoked, nor are the conditions satisfied.

188\. Importantly, the assessee had benchmarked royalty with instances of
royalty paid by third party licensee/distributors and had relied upon the
three agreements, which were quoted as comparables. As per the comparables,
the royalty paid was between 10-12% and they are:-

> ―(ii) Agreement between Double D'Import S.A.R.I (France) with Adidas
> International for payment of royalty @ 12%.

> (iii) Agreement of Sportsvision with Adidas international for payment of
> royalty @ 10%.

> (iv) Agreement of Molten Corporation Japan with Adidas International
> Marketing BV for payment of royalty @ 12%.‖

189\. The Tribunal has noted with disapproval the observation of the TPO that
comparable instances were not given, observing that this was factually
incorrect.

190\. However, do not agree with the finding recorded by the Tribunal that as
the Government of India had permitted remission of royalty through automatic
route, the royalty paid can be per se or conclusively treated as the arm's
length ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 133 of 142 price. Applicable rules
authorise remission of royalty upto a particular percentage under automatic
route to the foreign collaborators. Authorising remission through automatic
route upto a particular percentage, does not reflect examination of arm's
length principle. It would be incorrect to read into the general authorisation
under the Foreign Exchange Management Act and Rules, an implied adjudication
order on the question of quantum or arm's length price. When specific
permission is granted, the issue may acquire a different dimension. We do not
express any opinion, when specific permission is relied upon.

191\. The fact that royalty has been paid would be a relevant consideration
and factum, when we consider arm's length price of the international
transaction of distribution and marketing. Tax treatment of royalty payments
being different, the royalty transaction, therefore, may be benchmarked
separately. However, payment of royalty even if justified and appropriate on
applying arm's length principle, can be a relevant factor when the question of
compensation of the domestic AE for undertaking distribution and marketing
functions arises for consideration.

R. Question of Remand

192\. During the course of oral arguments, the assessed had filed tabulated
computations to establish and show the inaccuracies, unsavoury and severe, if
not bitter, consequences of the adjustments made by the TPO. For example, in
the case of Canon India Private Limited, the reasoning of the TPO was
challenged on the ground of absurdity and perversion, alleging that Indian
turnover was a miniscule percentage of the global turnover and, thus, profit
shifting by attributing higher or greater profits to Canon Inc. Japan, etc.
was ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 134 of 142 fallacious. Revenue has
contested some of the submissions by filing their own charts/tables.

193\. We would not like to go into several factual aspects for the first time,
for the factual matrix has not been examined and ascertained by the Tribunal.
Moreover, in terms with our legal finding, factual findings will have to be
examined. An order of remand for de novo consideration to the Tribunal would
be appropriate because the legal standards or ratio accepted and applied by
the Tribunal was erroneous. On the basis of the legal ratio expounded in this
decision, facts have to be ascertained and applied. If required and necessary,
the assessed and the Revenue should be asked to furnish details or tables. The
Tribunal, at the first instance, would try and dispose of the appeals, rather
than passing an order of remand to the Assessing Officer/TPO. The endeavour
should be to ascertain and satisfy whether the gross/net profit margin would
duly account for AMP expenses. When figures and calculations as per the TNM or
RP Method adopted and applied show that the net/gross margins are adequate and
acceptable, the appeal of the assessed should be accepted. Where there is a
doubt or the other view is plausible, an order of remand for re- examination
by the Assessing Officer/TPO would be justified. A practical approach is
required and the tribunal has sufficient discretion and flexibility to reach a
fair and just conclusion on the arm's length price.

Answers to Substantial Questions of Law

194\. In view of the aforesaid discussion, substantial questions of law in the
appeals filed by the assessee are answered as under:

> ―Q.1. Whether the additions suggested by the Transfer Pricing Officer on
> account of Advertising/Marketing and Promotion Expenses (‗AMP Expenses' for
> short) was beyond jurisdiction and bad in law as no specific reference was
> made by the Assessing Officer, having regard to retrospective amendment to
> Section 92CA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by Finance Act, 2012.‖ ITA 16/2014
> & connected matters Page 135 of 142 In terms of and subject to discussion
> under the heading C, paragraph Nos.41 to 50, the substantial question of law
> No.1 is answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.

―Q.2. Whether AMP Expenses incurred by the assessee in India can be treated
and categorized as an international transaction under Section 92B of the
Income Tax Act, 1961.‖ In terms of and subject to discussion under the heading
C, paragraph Nos.51 to 57, the substantial question of law No.2 is answered in
favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.

―Q.3. Whether under Chapter X of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a transfer pricing
adjustment can be made by the Transfer Pricing Officer/ Assessing Officer in
respect of expenditure treated as AMP Expenses and if so in which
circumstances?

Q.4. If answer to question Nos.2 and 3 is in favour of the Revenue, whether
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that transfer pricing
adjustment in respect of AMP Expenses should be computed by applying Cost Plus
Method.

Q.5. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in directing that
fresh bench marking/comparability analysis should be undertaken by the
Transfer Pricing Officer by applying the parameters specified in paragraph
17.4 of the order dated 23.01.2013 passed by the Special Bench in the case of
LG Electronics India (P) Ltd.?.‖ In terms of and subject to discussion under
the headings D to P, we hold that the legal ratio accepted and applied by the
Tribunal relying upon the majority decision in L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd
(supra) is erroneous and unacceptable. For reasons set out above, we have
passed an order of remand to the Tribunal to examine and ascertain facts and
apply the ratio enunciated in this decision. For the purpose of clarity, we
would like to enlist our findings:-

> (i) In case of a distributor and marketing AE, the first step in transfer
> pricing is to ascertain and conduct detailed functional analysis, which
> would include AMP function/expenses.

> (ii) The second step mandates ascertainment of comparables or comparable
> analysis. This would have reference to the method ITA 16/2014 & connected
> matters Page 136 of 142 adopted which matches the functions and obligations
> performed by the tested party including AMP expenses.

> (iii) A comparable is acceptable, if based upon comparison of conditions a
> controlled transaction is similar with the conditions in the transactions
> between independent enterprises. In other words, the economically relevant
> characteristics of the two transactions being compared must be sufficiently
> comparable. This entails and implies that difference, if any, between
> controlled and uncontrolled transaction, should not materially affect the
> conditions being examined given the methodology being adopted for
> determining the price or the margin. When this is not possible, it should be
> ascertained whether reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate
> the effect of such differences on the price or margin. Thus, identification

> a sequitur, it follows that the choice of the most appropriate method would
> be dependent upon availability of potential comparable keeping in mind the
> comparability analysis including befitting adjustments which may be
> required. As the degree of the comparability increases, extent of potential
> differences which would render the analysis inaccurate necessarily
> decreases.

> (iv) The assessed, i.e. the domestic AE must be compensated for the AMP
> expenses by the foreign AE. Such compensation may be included or subsumed in
> low purchase price or by not charging or charging lower royalty. Direct

> (ix) To assert and profess that brand building as equivalent or substantial
> attribute of advertisement and sale promotion would be largely ITA 16/2014 &

> (xi) The Assessing Officer/TPO for good and sufficient reasons can de-

(xiii) CP Method is a recognised and accepted method under Indian transfer
pricing regulation. It can be applied by the Assessing Officer/TPO in case AMP
expenses are treated as a separate international transaction, provided CP
Method is the most appropriate and reliable method.

ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 140 of 142

Adoption of CP Method and computation of cost and gross profit margin
comparable must be justified.

(xiv) The object and purpose of Transfer Pricing adjustment is to ensure that
the controlled taxpayers are given tax parity with uncontrolled taxpayers by
determining their true taxable income. Costs or expenses incurred for services
provided or in respect of property transferred, when made subject matter of
arm's length price by applying CP Method, cannot be again factored or included
as a part of inter- connected international transaction and subjected to arm's
length pricing.

195\. The above noted pointers have to be read along with our discussion under
the headings D to P. In case of any doubt, debate or purported conflict, it
would be preferable to rely upon detailed elucidation made under the headings,
D to P.

196\. Common questions raised by the Revenue in their appeals:-

> ―1. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in distinguishing
> and directing that selling expenses in the nature of trade/volume discounts,
> rebates and commission paid to retailers/dealers etc. cannot be included in
> the AMP Expenses?‖ In terms of and subject to our discussion under the
> headings O and P, the substantial question of law has to be answered against
> the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.

197\. The following substantial question of law is raised:

> ―Whether Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in setting aside/deleting
> transfer pricing adjustment made on account of payment of royalty to an
> associated enterprise?‖ ITA 16/2014 & connected matters Page 141 of 142 In
> view the discussion under the heading Q, the substantial question of law is
> answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.

198\. Lastly, a word of caution is necessary that our findings or ratio should
not be construed as an attempt to impart a talismanic precision to this
complex issue which would to a large extent depend on the factual matrix of a
given case. Disputes of such nature, highlight importance of ‗safe harbour
rules', for they instil certainty and curtail litigation.

199\. We must, at the conclusion, commend and acknowledge the contemplative
and epiphanic arguments put forth by the learned counsels of the assessed and
the Revenue. We had the benefit of the meticulous and intensive research and
study by the counsel for the assessed along with their associates, and the
Revenue, who were ably assisted by a team of officers.

200\. The appeals are accordingly disposed of. No costs.

201\. In order to cut short delay, the parties are directed to appear before
the Tribunal on 20th April, 2015, when a date of hearing will be fixed.
