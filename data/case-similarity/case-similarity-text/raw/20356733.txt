DATE : FEBRUARY 11, 2014.

ORAL JUDGMENT (Per Anoop V. Mohta, J.) Rule, returnable forthwith.

Ms Puranik for the Respondents waives service.

Heard finally by consent of parties.

2\. The Petitioner has invoked Article 226 of the Constitution of India and
prayed for setting aside the tender condition regarding Financial Eligibility
Criteria contained in the tender notice dated 20 January 2014 issued by the
Respondent-MCGM in respect of operation and maintenance of dewatering pumps.

    
    
    
    
    
    
                                                                                       1 of 6

         krs                                                                            wpL299.14
    
    

3\. The sale of e-tender started from 20 January 2014. The Petitioner filed
the present Petition on 03 February 2014 and on 05 February 2014 the matter
was listed on board. The tender will be opened on 12.02.2014. We have not
passed any ad-interim order. The contesting Respondent filed affidavit dated
11 February 2014 and pointed out that Packet A & B were opened on 05 February
2014 and on scrutiny it is observed that the Petitioner has quoted its bids
for six numbers of groups and out of which they have fulfilled the pre-
qualification criteria in five groups. This itself means that the Petitioner
participated in the proceedings since beginning to above extent and as
recorded above fulfilled the pre-qualification criteria also. The submission,
therefore, that the financial pre-

qualification criteria of the tender as 90% of average annual turnover of
estimated cost during last three years in each group and work experience of
40% of quantity of pumps in each group during last five years is arbitrary,
unreasonable and intended to deprive the persons like the Petitioner to
participate in the process itself is unacceptable.

4\. It is well-settled that the Respondent-Corporation is entitled to add or
amend and/or put in suitable conditions for a particular contract, based on
their experience. The eligibility criteria, therefore, so fixed by them thus
cannot be tested at the instance of the Petitioner, at this stage of
proceedings, specifically when such criteria so fixed cannot be stated to be
contrary to any provisions of law and/or breach of any declared policy and/or
any representations given at 2 of 6  ::: Downloaded on - 13/02/2014 23:14:32
::: krs wpL299.14 any point of time. It is settled that they are free to fix
and put in the tender conditions based on their requirements. No third person
is entitled to interfere and/or suggest to them to have a particular rule or
specific terms and conditions. The submission, therefore, that they have
suddenly changed the terms and added in the tender which intends to disentitle
persons like the Petitioner and/or support a particular party is also
unsupported by any material.

5\. Mere allegations and/or averments are not sufficient to prove mala fides
or arbitrariness. It is required to be supported by the material on record
especially when the Respondents in the reply have denied even those averments
made in the Petition. These questions of fact, therefore, cannot be considered
and/or accepted in the present Writ Petition, specifically when the facts on
record, including the conditions so read and referred, cannot be stated to be
arbitrary or discriminatory merely because the tender is of local authority.
All the parties or persons who want to submit their tender based on the terms
and conditions so announced are bound to accept the same. The concept of
inviting tender itself is and includes that no person is forced and/or
compelled to participate in the tender process if he does not accept the terms
and conditions.

6\. In Writ Petition no.2595 of 2012 (M/s.Akansha Apang Seva Shakari Sanstha
v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai & Ors.), a Division Bench of this
Court in judgment dated 03 December 2012, considered the 3 of 6  :::
Downloaded on - 13/02/2014 23:14:32 ::: krs wpL299.14 aspects of such types of
commercial contracts of the Respondents and/or such local bodies in the
following words:

> "5. Mr.Sakhare has relied upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in Tata

> Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development

> Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract

> unassailable.

> Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders have to be laid down to
> ensure that the contractor has the capacity and the resources to
> successfully execute the work."

7\. Therefore, for the above reasons, as no case is made out, the Petition is
accordingly dismissed. Rule is discharged. No costs.
