1\. This order shall dispose of the following applications filed by the
parties:

> a) IA No.4119/2011 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil
> Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the CPC) filed by the plaintiff.

CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.1 of 19

> b) IA No.5677/2011 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC filed by defendant.

2\. The plaintiff has filed the suit for permanent injunction restraining
infringement of trade mark, passing off, dilution and tarnishment of trade
mark, unfair competition, rendition of accountts, damages and delivery up
against the defendants, namely, Ms Kamini Jain, Mr Ashwani Jain and Kamini
Creations (Exports).

3\. The suit as well as the interim application were listed before the Court
on 15.03.2011 and after hearing the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the
summons were issued to the defendants in the suit and ad- interim injunction
was passed against the defendants thereby restraining the defendants from
manufacturing, fabricating, selling, distributing, storing men clothing by the
brand name ZEGNA though with different spellings JENYA and MENYA. The Local
Commissioner was appointed to make the inventory of the impugned goods.

4\. As per the facts mentioned in the plaint, it is contended that the
plaintiff is a company having its principal place of business in Italy. The
plaintiff together with Lanificio Ermenegildo ZEGNA and Figli, Ermenegildo
Zegna Corporation and all other remaining affiliated companies is a part of
the Ermenegildo Zegna Group and are manufacturing luxury clothing for men. It
is stated that on account of the business activity, the plaintiff along with
the other ZEGNA Group of CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.2 of 19 companies obtained
registration in the trade name ZEGNA in 150 countries all over the world. The
details of the registration by the plaintiff group are given in para 11 of the
plaint.

5\. The trade mark ZEGNA is derived from the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the
founder of the said Group Company. It is pronounced as ZEN-YAH in Italian
language throughout the world including India.

6\. The details of the Sales Turnover under the plaintiff‟s trade mark ZEGNA
are as follows:

    
    
         YEAR          WORLDWIDE SALES                  SALES IN INDIA
                               (in Euros)                    (in Euros)
         2005      571 million                         0.5 million
         2006      642 million                         0.2 million
         2007      703 million                         0.9 million
         2008      724 million                         2 million
         2009      690 million                         3 million
    
    
    

7\. It is alleged that the aforesaid figures of turnover/sales have shown
ascendency of 690 million Euros and the sales 3 million Euros in the year
2009, which clearly shows that its overall turnover has been increasing.

8\. It is averred that over a period of time, the plaintiff has acquired
certain reputation of manufacturing, selling and exporting the branded
readymade garments under the trade name ZEGNA which is also CS(OS) No.629/2011
Page No.3 of 19 registered in India. The learned counsel has drawn the
attention of the Court to the certificates of registration granted by Indian
authorities.

9\. The case of the plaintiff pleaded against the defendants is that some time
in September, 2010, the plaintiff came to know that the defendant No. 3 is
manufacturing, selling, exporting readymade garments such as shirts and
trousers under the brand name JENYA and MENYA which is the proprietorship
concern of defendant No.2 and the defendant No.1 is stated to be running the
business in question on behalf of the defendant No.3. The main thrust of the
plaintiff‟s arguments against the defendants is that they are selling men
clothing like shirt, kurta etc. under the deceptively similar trade mark of
the plaintiff and are giving an impression to the public at large that these
are the goods manufactured by the plaintiff which in fact is untrue. The said
act of the defendants amounts to infringement of the plaintiff‟s statutory
rights and the defendants are violating the same with impunity and are causing
harm to the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff without any
justification.

10\. The defendants‟ defence is that there is no visual, phonetic and
structural similarity whatsoever. Two names, i.e., ZEGNA and JENYA are
completely different. There cannot be any confusion and deception per se in
view thereof. It is contended that if a customer already knows that ZEGNA is
not pronounced as „ZEGNA‟ but as „ZEN-YAH‟ in the fancy Italian pronunciation,
then that customer would CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.4 of 19 never be confused
or even be likely to confuse it with Jenya. It is submitted that the essence
of purchase of high-end branded goods is their label and look and in this case
the emphasis is on the mark ZEGNA, with the special emphasis on the first
letter „Z‟. Thus, the customers who buy ZEGNA would never purchase in reality
any label which starts with the letter J and confuse it with ZEGNA.

It is stated that the customers who purchase the high-end Italian brand ZEGNA
are the "elite upper strata and educated" class who would clearly see the
obvious difference in the two marks. If there is such a clear difference in
the customers, there can be no confusion.

11\. Mr Darpan Wadhwa, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants,
has argued that there are various decisions which have clearly laid down the
test and deal with the issue of lack of phonetic and visual similarity and
wherein it is held that the first syllable of a word mark is generally the
most important, especially in cases of short marks and there is a general
tendency to slur the termination of words. As in the present case, the first
syllable is different in look and sound, there is no question of slurring the
termination of words.

12\. From the pleading and documents adduced by the plaintiff, it is the
admitted position that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the mark
ZEGNA in classes 24 and 25 under registration Nos. 277992 and 643530\. The
plaintiff has also obtained the registrations for CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.5
of 19 transliteration of the mark जेनिया (in Hind) in classes 24 and 25 under
registration Nos.817785 and 817786. The details of Indian registration
obtained by the plaintiff are tabulated hereinbelow :

13\. Mr Pravin Anand, the learned counsel for the plaintiff, submits that the
plaintiff has produced the evidence on record to show that the plaintiff‟s
well known trade mark ZEGNA is pronounced as ZEN-YAH throughout the world,
including in India. Therefore, the use of the trade mark JENYA by the
defendants would create confusion and deception and the case of infringement
of the trade mark is made out by the plaintiff. In addition to the mark जेनिया
in Hindi which is deceptively similar with the mark JENYA used by the
defendants, two competing marks "ZEGNA" and "JENYA‟ are even otherwise,
visually and phonetically identical as it is quite common for the letter Z to
be pronounced as J and vice-versa. Further, he says that as far as mark MENYA
is concerned, the plaintiff has no objection if the defendants are permitted
to use the same in a different style.

14\. In view of the facts mentioned above, the question before this court is
whether the mark JENYA used by defendants in relation to the CS(OS)
No.629/2011 Page No.7 of 19 same goods amounts to infringement of plaintiffs‟
registered trade marks and/or any case of passing off is made out by the
plaintiff. The two sets of the marks used and claimed by the parties have to
be compared in view of the pleadings and documents are placed on record. The
following points are to be considered:

    
    
           a)     whether the two marks ZEGNA                and JENYA are
                  deceptively similar;
    
           b)     whether the mark ZEGNA is pronounced as ZEN-YAH in
    

the trade as claimed by the plaintiff and if the answer is positive then is it
similar with the defendants‟ mark JENYA; and lastly

c) whether the plaintiff‟s mark जेनिया registered in Hindi is protectable in
the absence of user of the mark in India.

15\. The concept of aural confusion is statutorily embodied in Section 29 (9)
of the Trademarks Act, 1999 in so far as it states that "Where the distinctive
elements of a registered trademark consist of or include words, the trade mark
may be infringed by spoken use of the words as well as their visual
representation and the reference in this section to the use of the mark shall
be construed accordingly." In view of the fact that the Legislature has
included the spoken use of the words as an infringing activity, it is clearly
evident that the pronunciation of the trade mark is clearly a determining
criteria in ascertaining infringement.

16\. Section 29(2) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 recognizes the concept of
likelihood of association, wherein the consumer is likely to CS(OS)
No.629/2011 Page No.8 of 19 believe that the Defendants‟ mark has an
association/affiliation/ connection with the Plaintiff or that the Defendants
have the approval of the plaintiff to use the said trade mark.

17\. The plaintiff has produced certain documents which includes internet
downloads in order to show that the plaintiff‟s trade mark is pronounced as
ZEN-YAH.

A CD containing sound clips downloaded from the internet is also filed and
placed in court which is prima facie evidencing that the plaintiff‟s trade
mark is pronounced as ZEN-YAH. The affidavit of the investigator who visited
the plaintiff‟s store at DLF Emporio Mall in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi and
conducted the investigation has been filed alongwith annexures. It is stated
in the affidavit that during the course of the investigation, the staff at the
said store consistently pronounced the said trade mark as ZEN - YAH.

18\. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Encore
Electronics Ltd. v Anchor Electronics and Electricals Pvt. Ltd. 2007 (35) PTC
714 has dealt with a similar point about the phonetically similarity between
two trade marks "Encore" and "Anchor". The same reads as under:-

> "The phonetic similarity between "Anchor" on the one hand and "Encore" on
> the other, is striking. The two marks are phonetically, visually and Page
> 0646 structurally similar. The overall impression conveyed by a mark as a
> whole, has to be assessed in evaluating whether the mark of CS(OS)
> No.629/2011 Page No.9 of 19 the defendant is deceptively similar to the mark
> of the plaintiff. Phonetic similarity constitutes an important index of
> whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading similarity to another. The
> phonetic structure indicates how the rival marks ring in the ears. Courts in
> a country such as ours whose culture is enriched by a diversity of languages
> and scripts have to consider how the rival marks are spelt and pronounced in
> languages in which they are commonly used. Counsel for the Defendant submits
> before the Court that whiel "Encore" is a word of Frensh origin, „Anchor‟ is
> a word of English usage and the pronounciation of the two words must differ.
> The submission misses the point. The case before the Court is not about how
> an Englishman would pronounce „Anchor‟ or a Frenchman would pronounce
> "Encore". The Court must consider the usage of words in India, the manner in
> which a word would be written in Indian languages and last but not least,
> the similarity of pronunciation if the rival marks are used. The manner in
> which the „a‟, as in „anchor‟ is pronounced by an Englishman or Notting Hill
> may well appear to be discerning traveller to be distinct from a Frenchman‟s
> pronunciation of the „e‟ in „encore‟ on a fashionable by lane near Champs
> Elysees. That is no defence to an action in our Courts for passing off. For
> the ordinary consumer in Ahmedabad and her counterpart in Mumbai‟s shopping
> streets, the „a‟ in „anchor‟ and the „e‟ in „encore‟ are perilously and
> deceptively similar. The Court must assess the make up of an Indian consumer
> and, associated with that, the cultural traits that underlie the spelling
> and pronunciation of words. The case of the Plaintiff is that in Gujarti as
> well as in Hindi, there is no even a subtle distinction between the manner
> in which „Anchor‟ and "Encore" would be pronounced and we find merit in the
> submission. The overall impact in terms of phonetical usage is one of
> striking similarity. The test is not whether a customer who wishes to buy
> the product of the plaintiff is likely to end up buying the product of the
> Defendant. The test is whether the ordinary customer is likely to be led to
> believe that „Encore‟ is associated with the mark and the trading style of
> the plaintiff. The phonetical, visual and structural get up of the two words
> is so strikingly similar as to lead to a likelihood of deception. The
> question of deception is a matter for the Court to determine, particularly
> at the interlocutory stage. (para 9).

CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.10 of 19

19\. Thus, in Section 29 (2) is read with Section 29 (9) the legislature has
included the spoken use of the words also, therefore, it is evident that the
pronunciation of the trade mark is clearly a determining criteria in
ascertaining infringement.

20\. In the case of Laxmikant V.Patel vs Chetanbhat Shah & Anr.; (2002) 3 SCC
65, the Supreme Court observed:

> "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business in such a way as
> would persuade the customers or clients in believing that the goods or
> services belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith. It
> does not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise.
> The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be,
> the basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts
> or intends to adopt a name in connection with his business or services which
> already belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has propensity
> of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself and
> thereby resulting in injury."

> The Apex Court further observed:

> "Where there is probability of confusion in business, an injunction will be
> granted even though the defendants adopted the name innocently."

21\. In the case of Aristoc Ld.v. Rysta Ld.;62 RPC 65 wherein the trade mark
„RYSTA‟ was held to be deceptively similar to „ARISTOC‟ the House of Lords
came to the conclusion that both sounds are very similar. Similarly in the
case of M/s Pidilite Industries Pvt. Ltd v M/s Mittes Corporation and another;
1989 PTC 151 this Court held that CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.11 of 19 the
trade mark "Trevical" is similar to "Fevicol". Further in the case of The
Bombay Oil Industries v Ballrapur Industries Ltd.; AIR 1989 Del 77 decided by
this Court, it was held that the two trade marks "Shapola" and "Saffola" are
similar. In the case of Bulova Accutron Trade Mark Application; [1969] RPC
102, the trade mark „Bulova Accutron was held to be similar to „Accurist‟.
Similarly, in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, the
Apex Court held that the trade mark „Amritdhara‟ is similar to
„Lakshmandhara‟. In yet another case of Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v Mahavir
Steels & others; 47(1992) DLT 412 this court came to the conclusion that the
trade mark „Tisco‟ and „Fisco‟ are deceptively similar and issued the interim
injunction against the defendant. Similar view was taken by the Division Bench
of this court in the case of Castrol Ltd. and Another Vs. A.K. Mehta and Anr.
reported in 2003(27)PTC600(Del) wherein two marks CASTROL and BESTROL were
held to be similar. In the case of Oil Mill Co. vs. Wipro Ltd.; AIR 1986 Delhi
345, it has been held by this Court that the two trade marks Dubble and Bubble
are deceptively similar with each other.

22\. In the case of K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal & Co. and Anr.;
AIR 1970 SC 146, wherein the rival trade marks of the parties were Ambal and
Andal, the Supreme Court held that there is striking similarity and affinity
of sound between the two trade marks. The Supreme Court in paras 10 and 12 of
the judgment considered the CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.12 of 19 ocular
comparison test which read as under:

> "10. There is no evidence of actual confusion, but that might be due to the
> fact that the appellant‟s trade is not of long standing. There is no visual
> resemblance between the two marks, but ocular comparison is not always the
> decisive test. The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with
> reference to the ear as well as the eye. There is a close affinity of sound
> between Ambal and Andal.

> 12\. The name Andal does not cease to be deceptively similar because it is
> used in conjunction with a pictorial device. The case of Decordova v. Vick

> essential features."

23\. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also argued on the question of
dilution. He argued that the defendant‟s use of the impugned marks in the
course of the same trade and for the same products is bound to cause serious
prejudice to the ability of the trade mark ZEGNA to exclusively identify the
plaintiff and its group companies and their products leading to grave dilution
of the trade mark ZEGNA. Additionally, the Defendant‟s use of the impugned
marks is bound to lead CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.13 of 19 to tarnishment,
diminution, weakening and eventual erosion of the goodwill, reputation and the
positive associations linked to the plaintiff‟s trade mark ZEGNA.

24\. In the most recent case referred as T.V. Venugopal v Ushodaya Enterprises
Ltd. and Anr.; (2011) 4 SCC 85 it has been held by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
that permitting the appellant to carry on his business in the name of "Eenadu"
in the State of Andhra Pradash would lead to eroding extraordinary reputation
and goodwill acquired by the respondent company over a passage of time. It is
further submitted by him that that the sophistication of the consumer cannot
be a determining factor in ascertaining the likelihood of confusion,
especially since a consumer who is sophisticated with respect to one
particular field may not necessarily be sophisticated with respect to all
fields.

25\. The other aspect of the matter is that the plaintiff is also holding the
registration of mark जेनिया in Hindi. The plaintiff also sought protection on
that registration. Learned counsel for the defendants however argued that the
said mark is registered in favour of the plaintiff but the same has not been
used as of today and is liable to be rectified under Section 47 of the
Trademarks and Merchandise Marks Act. Let me now deal with the said aspect of
the matter.

26\. In the present case, it is the admitted position that the CS(OS)
No.629/2011 Page No.14 of 19 defendants have not challenged the registration
of the mark जेनिया (in Hind). Therefore, the registration granted in favour of
the plaintiff at this stage is a valid registration.

27\. The legal effect of Registration Registration of a mark gives the
registered proprietor the exclusive right to use the registered mark (Section
28 of the Trademark Act, 1999) and the use of an "identical" or "deceptively
similar" mark by another without any permission/authority amounts to
infringement of the registered mark (Section 29 of the Act).

A. In the case of Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical
Laboratories; AIR 1965 SC 980, it was held:

> "The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the
> registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the
> exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods"

> "If the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
> adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other
> writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods
> for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
> different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
> immaterial."

B. In the case of American Home Products v. Mac Laboratories; AIR 1986 137 it
was held as follows : CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.15 of 19

> "When a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires valuable rights
> by reason of such registration. Registration of his trade mark give him the
> exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in
> respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right
> by any other person using a mark which is the same or deceptively similar to
> his trade mark, he can project his trade mark by an action for infringement
> in which he can obtain injunction...."

> C. In the case of National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Mfg.

Co.; 1971 AIR SC 898, it was held as under:

> "On registration of a trade mark the registered proprietor gets under
> section 28 the exclusive right to the use of such trade marks in relation to
> the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain
> relief in respect of any infringement of such trade mark."

D. In the case of Avis International v. Avi Footwear; AIR 1992 Delhi 22 it was
observed as follows :

> "In my view violation of the exclusive statutory rights is illegal activity,
> to hold otherwise will negate the statutory provisions of the Trade and
> Merchandise Marks Act."

28\. It is settled law that in interlocutory proceedings, the Court is
entitled to proceed upon the footing that a mark which is registered is prima
facie valid. (See Chelton v. Goldston; (1957) RPC 416)

29\. On a motion for interlocutory injunction it is not the practice to
consider the validity of registration of plaintiffs‟ mark. (see Hindustan
Embroidery v. Ravindra; 76 Bombay LR 146 and CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.16 of
19 Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan & Anr.; 1999 PTC (19)

81)

30\. In the case of Midas Hygiene v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors.; 2004 (28) PTC 121
(SC), it was observed as follow :

> "The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears
> that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest."

31\. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants has referred to
the following cases in support of his submissions:

> a. Johann A Wulfing v. C.I. & P Labs: AIR 1984 Bom 281. b. American Home
> Products v. Mac Laboratories: AIR 1986 SC 137.

> c. F. Hoffimann-La Roche and co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manners and Co. Private
> Ltd: AIR 1970 SC 2062. d. Gufic Limited & Anr. v. Clinique Laboratories, Llc
> & Anr.: (2010) 43 PTC 788 (Del) (DB).

> e. Cadila Labs v. Dabur India Ltd.: (1997) Arb LR 704. f. Biofarma & Anr. v.
> Sanjay Medical Store & Anr., 1998 PTC (18) 671.

> g. Kewal Krishan Kumar v. Rudi Roller Flour Mills: (2007) 35 PTC 848 (Del)
> (DB).

> h. Lowenbrau AG v. Jagpin Breweries Ltd: (157) 2009 DLT 791.

32\. After having considered the judgments (a) and (b) referred to by the
learned counsel for the defendants, it appears that most of the judgments
filed are pertaining to the pharmaceutical preparation where the drugs are
schedule drugs and are sold under the Doctors prescription, and as per settled
law totally a different test of comparison has been CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page
No.17 of 19 applied. Therefore, it is not necessary that the said decisions
are applicable in the present case.

33\. The other decision referred to by the defendant Kewal Kishore Kumar v.
Rudi Roller Flour Mills (supra) is also not applicable to the facts of the
present case as in the said para it was clearly stated that the trademark of
the appellant was descriptive. The relevant para of the judgment reads as
under:

> "The mark applied for by the respondent No.1 consists of the device
> „Trishul‟ and „Damru‟ and the phrase „Shiv Shakti‟ is descriptive of the
> goods of the respondent No.1. The aforesaid words „Shiv Shakti‟ when read as
> a whole would be a descriptive word and is having a distinct prefix of Shiv,
> a God of Hindu mythology. There also cannot be a monopoly with regard to the
> word „Shakti‟ which is descriptive word. Trade mark of the appellant is
> „Shakti Bhog Atta‟ to which the appellant can claim exclusive use but not to
> the word „Shakti‟, more so when „Shakti‟ is used with „Shiv‟ would depict
> the power and strength of a religious God."

34\. Under these circumstances, considering the entire facts and law
applicable to the present, I am of the considered view that the defendants‟
use of the impugned trade mark „JENYA‟ in the course of the same trade and for
the same product is likely to cause confusion and deception and it is
deceptively similar with the registered trade mark of the plaintiff i.e. ZEGNA
which is also pronounced as ZEN-YAH and जेनिया registered in Hindi. Therefore,
the defendants are restrained from CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.18 of 19 using
the trade mark „JENYA‟ in respect of readymade garments, shirts, trousers and
any other similar goods as that of the plaintiff and the ex- parte ad-interim
order granted on 15.03.2011 is confirmed. However, the defendants shall be
entitled to use the trade mark "MENYA" in relation to these goods as no
objection has been raised by the plaintiff with regard to „MENYA‟. The
findings hereinabove shall have no bearing when the matter is considered after
trial.

The applications stand disposed of.
