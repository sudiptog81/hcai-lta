    HEADNOTE:
    The  petitioner was issued a passport on June 1, 1976  under
    the  Passport  Act,  1967.  On the 4th	of  July  1977,	 the
    petitioner received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977, from	 the
    Regional  Passport Officer Delhi intimating to her  that  it
    was  decided  by  the Government of  India  to	impound	 her
    passport under s. 10(3)(c) of the Act "in public  interest".
    The petitioner was required to surrender her passport within
    7  days	 from the receipt of that  letter.   The  petitioner
    immediately  addressed	a letter to  the  Regional  Passport
    Officer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of
    reasons for making the order as provided in s.10(5). A reply
    was  sent by the Government of India, Ministry	of  External
    Affairs	 on  6th  July	1977 stating  inter  alia  that	 the
    Government  decided "in the interest of the general  public"
    not to furnish her copy of the statement of reasons for	 the
    making	of  the order.	The petitioner thereupon  filed	 the
    present	 Writ Petition challenging action of the  Government
    in-  impounding her passport and declining to  give  reasons
    for doing so.  The Act was enacted on 24-4-67 in view of the
    decision of this Court in Satwant Singg Sawhney's case.	 The
    position  which obtained prior to the coming into  force  of
    the  Act was that there was no law regulating the  issue  of
    passports for leaving the shores of India and going  abroad.
    The  issue of passport was entirely within the unguided	 and
    unchannelled  discretion  of  the  Executive.	In   Satwant
    Singh's	 case,	this  Court  bell by  a	 majority  that	 the
    expression  'personal liberty' in Article 21 takes  in,	 the
    right  of locomotion and travel abroad and under Art. 21  no
    person	can  be deprived of his right to  go  abroad  except
    according  to  the  procedure  established  by	law.	This
    decision  was accepted by the Parliament and  the  infirmity
    pointed	 but  by it was set right by the  enactment  of	 the
    Passports Act, 1967.  The preamble of the Act shows that  it
    was enacted to provide for the issue of passport and  travel
    documents  to regulate the departure from India of  citizens
    of India and other persons and for incidental and  ancillary matters.	Se
    ction 3 provides that no person	 shall	denart
    from or attempt to depart from India unless he holds in this
    'behalf	 a valid passport or travel document.  Section	5(1)
    provides  for  making  of  an application  for	issue  of  a
    passport  or travel document for visiting  foreign  country.
    Sub-section  (2) of section 5 says that on receipt  of	such
    application  the  Passport  Authority,	after  making	such
    enquiry,  if  any, as it may consider necessary,  shall,  by
    order  in writing, issue or refuse to issue the passport  or
    travel	document or make or refuse to make that passport  or
    travel document endorsement in
    622
    -respect  of one or more of the foreign countries  specified
    in  the application.  Sub-section (3) requires the  Passport
    Authority  where it refuses to issue the passport or  travel
    document  or to make any endorsement to record in writing  a
    brief  statement  of  its reasons  for	making	such  order.
    Section	 6(1)  lays down the grounds on which  the  Passport
    Authority  shall refuse to make an endorsement for  visiting
    any foreign country and provides that on no other ground the
    endorsement  shall be refused.	Section 6(2)  specifies	 the
    grounds on which alone and on no other grounds the  Passport
    Authority  shall  refuse  to issue the	Passport  or  travel
    document  for  visiting	 any  foreign  country	and  amongst
    various	 grounds  set  out there the last  is  that  in	 the
    opinion	 of the Central Government the issue of passport  or
    travel	document to the applicant will not be in the  public
    interest.   Sub-section	 (1)  of  section  10  empowers	 the
    Passport  Authority to vary or cancel the endorsement  on  a
    passport  or travel document or to vary or cancel it on	 the
    conditions  subject to which a passport or  travel  document
    has been issued having regard to, inter alia, the provisions
    of s. 6(1) or any notification under s. 19. Sub-section	 (2)
    confers	 powers on the Passport Authority to vary or  cancel
    the  conditions	 of the passport or travel document  on	 the
    application of the holder of the passport or travel document
    and  with the previous approval of the	Central	 Government.
    Sub-section  (3)  provides that the Passport  Authority	 may
    impound	 or  cause to be impounded or revoke a	passport  or
    travel	document on the grounds set out in cl. (a)  to	(h).
    The order impounding the passport in the present, case,	 was
    made by the Central Government under cl. (c) which reads  as
    follows :-
    	      "(c)  If	the  passport  authority  deems	  it
    	      necessary	 so  to do in the  interest  of	 the
    	      sovereignty   and	 integrity  of	India,	 the
    	      security of India, friendly relations of India
    	      with the foreign country, or in the  interests
    	      of the general public."
    Sub-section  (5) requires the Passport Authority  impounding
    or  revoking  a passport or travel document  or	 varying  or
    cancelling an endorsement made upon it to record in  writing
    a  brief statement of the reasons for making such order	 and
    furnish to the holder of the passport or travel document  on
    demand a copy of the same, unless, in any case, the Passport
    Authority  is  of  the opinion that it will not	 be  in	 the
    interest  of  the sovereignty and integrity  of	 India,	 the
    security  of  India, friendly relations of  India  with	 any
    foreign country, or in the interest of the general public to
    furnish	 such  a copy.	The Central Government	declined  to
    furnish	 a copy of this statement of reasons for  impounding
    the passport of the petitioner on the ground that it was not
    in  the interest of the general public to furnish such	copy
    to the petitioner.
    The petitioner contended.
    1.The  right to go abroad is part of  "personal	 liberty"
    within the meaning of that expression as used in Art. 21 and
    no one can be deprived of this right except according to the
    procedure   prescribed	by  law.   There  is  no   procedure
    prescribed by the Passport Act, for impounding or revoking a
    Passport.  Even if some procedure can be traced in the	said
    Act  it is unreasonable and arbitrary in as much as it	does
    not  provide for giving an opportunity to the holder of	 the
    Passport to be heard against the making of the order.
    2.Section  10(3) (c) is violative of  fundamental  rights
    guaranteed under Articles 14,19(1) (a) and (g) and 21.
    3.The  impugned	 order is made in  contravention  of  the
    rules  of natural justice and is, therefore, null and  void.
    The  impugned  order has effect of placing  an	unreasonable
    restriction  on	 the  right of free  speech  and  expression
    guaranteed to the petitioner under Article 19(1) (a) as also
    on  the	 right to carry on the profession  of  a  journalist
    conferred under Art. 19 (1) (g).
    4.   The impugned order could not consistently with Articles
    19(1)(a) and (g)be  passed on a mere information of  the
    Central	 Government that the presence of the  petitioner  is
    likely	to  be required in connection with  the	 proceedings
    before the Commission of Inquiry.
    623
    5.In  order that a passport may be impounded under s.  10
    (3) (c), public interest must actually exist in present	 and
    mere likelihood of public interest .arising in future  would
    be no ground for impounding the passport.
    6. It was not correct to say that the petitioner was  likely
    to  be	required  for  .giving	evidence  before  the	Shah
    Commission.
    The  respondents  denied  the  contentions  raised  by	 the
    petitioner.
    BEG, C. J., (Concurring with Bhagwati, J.)
    1.The  right of travel and to go outside the  country  is
    included in the fight to personal liberty. [643 G]

    2.Article  21  though  framed as to appear  as	a  shield
    operating  negatively  against executive  encroachment	over
    something covered by that hield, is the legal recognition of
    both the protection or the shield as well as of what it pro-
    tects which lies beneath that shield. [644 B]
    A.K.  Gopalan  v.  State of Madras,  [1950]  SCR  88  and
    Additional  District  Magistrate, Jabalpur v. S.  S.  Shukla

    SCR 530 referred to.
    3.The view that Articles 19 and 21 constitute  watertight
    compartments has been rightly over-ruled.  The doctrine that
    Articles  19 and 21 protect or regulate flows  in  different
    channels, was laid down in A. K. Gopalan's case in a context
    which  was very different from that in which  that  approach
    was displaced by the counter view that the constitution must
    be  read as an integral whole, with possi, ble	overlappings
    of the subject matter, of what is sought to be protected  by
    its various provisions, particularly by articles relating to
    fundamental  rights.  The ob. servations in A. K.  Gopalan's
    case  that  due	 process  with regard  to  law	relating  to
    preventive  detention  are  to be found in Art.	 22  of	 the
    Constitution  because it is a self-contained code for  laws.
    That  observation was the real ratio decidendi of  Gopalan's
    case.	Other observations relating to the  separability  of
    the  subject  matters  of Art. 21 and 19  were	mere  obiter
    dicta.	 This Court has already held in A. D. M.  Jabalpur's
    case  by reference to the decision from Gopalan's cast	that
    the  ambit of personal liberty protected by Art. 21 is	wide
    and   comprehensive.   The  questions  relating	 to   either
    deprivation or restrictions of per sonal liberty, concerning
    laws falling outside Art. 22 remain really unanswered by the
    Gopalan's  case.   The field of 'due process' for  cases  of
    preventive detenu tion is fully covered by Art. 22 but other
    parts  of that field not covered by Art 22 are	'unoccupied'
    by  its specific provisions.  In what may be  called  unoccu
    -pied  portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty,	 the
    substantive  as well as procedural laws made to cover  them
    must satisfy the requirements of both Arts 14 and 19 of	 the
    Constitution. [646 E-H, 647 B-D, 648 A-B]
    Articles dealing with different fundamental rights contained
    in  Part HI of the ,Constitution do not	 represent  entirely
    separate  streams  of rights which do not  ,mingle  at	many
    points.	  They are all parts of an integrated scheme in	 the
    Constitution.	Their  waters must mix	to  constitute	that
    grand	flow  unimpeded	 .and  impartial  justice   (social,
    economic  and  political),  freedom (not  only	of  thought,
    expression,   belief,  faith  and  worship,  but   also	  of
    association,  movement vocation or occupation as well as  of
    acquisition  and  possession  of  reasonable  property),  or
    equality (of status and of opportunity, which imply  absence
    of    unreasonable   or	  unfair   discrimination    between
    individuals,   groups  and  classes),  and   of	  fraternity
    (assuring  dignity-of  the individual and the unity  of	 the
    nation)
    624
    which  our  Constitution visualfses.  Isolation	 of  various
    aspects of human freedom, for purposes of their	 protection,
    is  neither realistic nor beneficial but would	defeat	very
    objects of such protection. [648 B-D]
    Blackstone's theory of natural rights cannot be rejected  as
    totally	 irfelevantIf we have advanced today towards  higher
    civilization  and  in a more enlightened era we	 cannot	 lag
    behind	what,  at  any	rate,  was  the	 meaning  given	  to
    'personal. liberty' long ago by Blackstone.  Both the rights
    of personal security and personal liberty recognised by what
    Blackstone  termed 'natural law' are embodied in Act. 21  of
    the Constitution. [649 A-C, 650 H, 651 A-B]
    A.D. M. Jabalpur vs.  S. S. Shukla [1976] Supp.	 S.C.R.	 172
    relied on.
    The  natural law rights were meant to be converted into	 our
    constitutionally recognised fundamental rights so that	they
    are  to	 be found within it and not outside it.	 To  take  a
    contrary  view would involve a conflict between natural	 law
    and our constitutional law.  A 'divorce between natural	 law
    and  our constitutional law would be disastrous.   It  would
    defeat	one of the basic purposes of our Constitution.	[652
    B-C]
    The  total  effect and not the mere form  of  a	 restriction
    would determine which. fundamental right is really  involved
    in  a  particular case and whether a restriction.  upon	 its
    exercise   is  reasonably  permissible	on  the	 facts	 and
    circumstances of that case. [652 H, 653A]
    If  rights under Art. 19 are rights which inhere  in  Indian
    citizens,  individuals	carry  these  inherent	 fundamental
    constitutional rights with them-wherever they go, in so	 far
    as  our	 law applies to them, because they are part  of	 the
    Indian National just as Indian ships, flying the Indian flag
    are  deemed  in international law to be	 floating  parts  of
    Indian	territory.   This  analogy, however,  could  not  be
    pushed	 too  far  because  Indian  citizens,	on   foreign
    territory,  are	 only  entitled by virtue  of  their  Indian
    Nationality  and Passports to the protection of	 the  Indian
    Republic  and  the  assistance of  its	Diplomatic  Missions
    abroad.	  They cannot claim to be governed abroad  by  their
    own  constitutional  or personal laws which do	not  operate
    outside India. [653 A-C]
    In  order to apply the test contained in Arts. 14 and 19  of
    the  Constitution we have to consider the objects for  which
    the exercise of inherent rights recognised by Art. 21 of the
    Constitution  are  restricted as well as  the  procedure  by
    which  these  restrictions are sought to  be  imposed,	both
    substantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them
    will  have  to pass the test imposed by, Arts.	14  and	 19,
    whenever facts justifying the invocation of either of  these
    Articles  may  be disclosed, for example,  an  international
    singer	or  dancer  may	 well be  able	to  complain  of  an
    unjustifiable restriction on professional activity by denial
    of  a passport.	 In such a case, violation of both Arts.  21
    and 19(1)(g) may be put forward making it necessary for	 the
    authorities concerned to justify the restriction imposed  by
    showing	 satisfaction of tests of validity  contemplated  by
    each of 'these two Articles. [653 F-H]
    The  tests of reason and justice cannot be  abstract.	They
    cannot be divorced' from the needs of the nation.  The tests
    have  to  be  pragmatic otherwise they	would  cease  to  be
    reasonable.  The discretion left to the authority to impound
    a  passport  in Public interest cannot	invalidate  the	 law
    itself.	  We  cannot, out of fear, that such power  will  be
    misused,  refuse to permit Parliament to entrust  even	such
    power	to  executive  authorities  as	may  be	  absolutely
    necessary to carry out the purposes of a validly exercisable
    power.	In matters such as, grant, suspension, impounding or
    cancellation  of  passports,  the  possible  dealing  of  an
    individual  with nationals and authorities of  other  States
    have  to  be  considered.   The	 contemplated  or   possible
    activities  abroad  of the individual may have to  be  taken
    into account.  There may be questions of national safety and
    welfare	 which transcend the importance of the	individual's
    inherent  right	 to  go	 where he  or  she  pleases  to	 go.
    Therefore, the grant of wide discretionary power to the exe-
    cutive authorities cannot be considered as unreasonable	 yet
    there must be procedural safeguards to ensure that the Power
    will not be used for purposes extraneous to the grant of the
    power.	 The procedural proprieties must be  insisted  upon.

    A bare, look at the provisions. of s. 10(3) shows. that each
    of the orders which- could be passed; under s. 10(3) (a) and
    (b)  requires  a satisfaction of the Passport  Authority  on
    certain	 objective  conditions which must exist	 in  a	case
    before it passes an order to impound a passport or a  travel
    document.  Impounding or revocation are placed side by	side
    on the same footing in the provisions [654 G-H]
    It  is clear from the provisions of the Act that there is  a
    statutory   right  also	 acquired,  on	fulfilment  of	 the
    prescribed conditions by the holder of a passport, that	 it
    should continue to be effective for the specified period  so
    long  as no ground has come into existence for	either	its
    revocation   or	 for  impounding  it  which  amounts  to   a
    suspension of, it for the time being.  It is true that in  a
    proceedings. under Art. 32, the Court is concerned only with
    the,  enforcement of fundamental constitutional	 rights	 and
    not  with  any	statutory  rights  apart  from	fundamental.
    rights.	 Article 21 , however, makes it Clear that violation
    of all law whether statutory or of any other kind is  itself
    an infringement of the guaranteed fundamental right. [655 B-
    D]
    The  orders under s. 10(3) must be based upon some  material
    even  if that material concerns in some cases of  reasonable
    suspicion  arising from certain credible assertions made  by
    reliable   individuals.	  In  an  emergent  situation,	 the
    impounding  of a passport may become necessary without	even
    giving an opportunity to be heard against such a step  which
    could  be  reversed  after an opportunity is  given  to	 the
    holder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary.
    However,  ordinarily no passport could be reasonably  either
    impounded  or revoked without giving a prior opportunity  to
    its  holder to show cause against the proposed action.	[655
    D-E]
    It  is	well-settled  that even when there  is	no  specific
    provision in a statute or rules made thereunder for  showing
    case  against  action  proposed	 to  be	 taken	against	  an
    individual,  which affects the right of that individual	 the
    duty  to  give reasonable opportunity to be  heard  will  be
    implied from the nature of the function to be perform,,,' by
    the  authority	which  has the power  to  take	punitive  or
    damaging action. [655 G]

    Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works, [1863] 14 C.B. (N.	 S.)
    180 quoted with approval.
    An   order  impounding	a  passport  must  be  made   quasi-
    judicially.   This  was not done in the	 present  case.	  It
    cannot be said that a good enough reason has been shown	 too
    exist  for impounding the passport of the  petitioner.	 The
    petitioner had no opportunity of showing that the ground for
    impounding  it given in this Court either does not exist  or
    has  no	 bearing on public interest or that the	 public	 in-
    terest can be better served in some other manner.  The order
    should	be quashed and the respondent should be directed  to
    give an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause  against
    any proposed action on such grounds as may be available.
    			 [656 E-G]
    There were no pressing grounds with regard to the petitioner
    that  the  immediate action of impounding her  passport	 was
    called	for.   The  rather cavalier  fashion  in  which	 the
    disclosure of any reason for impounding of her passport	 was
    denied	to  the petitioner despite the fact  that  the	only
    reason said to exist is the possibility of her being  called
    to  give  evidence before a Commission of Inquiry.   Such  a
    ground is not such as to be reasonably deemed to necessitate
    its concealment in public interest. [656 G-H]
    Even executive authorities when taking administrative action
    which involves any deprivation of or restriction on inherent
    fundamental  rights of citizens must take care to  see	that
    justice is not only done but manifestly appears to be  done.
    They have a duty to proceed in a way which is free from even
    the   appearance  of  arbitrariness,   unreasonableness	  or
    unfairness.  They have to act in a manner which is  patently
    impartial and meets the requirements of natural justice [657
    A-B]
    62 6
    As the undertaking given by the Attorney General amounts  to
    an offer to deal with the petitioner justly and fairly after
    informing  her of any ground that may exist  for  impounding
    her passport, no further action by this Court is  necessary.

    Petition allowed with costs. [657D]
    Chandrachud, J. (concurring with Bhagwati, J.)
    The power to refuse to disclose the reasons for impounding a
    passport  is  of an exceptional nature and it  ought  to  be
    exercised fairly, sparingly and only when fully justified by
    the  exigencies	 of an uncommon situation.  The	 reasons  if
    disclosed, being open to judicial scrutiny for	ascertaining
    their  nexus  with the order impounding	 the  passport,	 the
    refusal	 to disclose the reasons would also be open  to	 the
    scrutiny  of  the court; or else the wholesome	power  of  a
    dispassionate judicial examination of executive orders could
    with impunity be set at nought by an obdurate  determination
    to  suppress  the reasons.  The disclosure  made  under	 the
    stress	of the Writ Petition that the petitioner's  passport
    was  impounded	because,  her  presence	 was  likely  to  be
    required  in  connection  with	the  proceedings  before   a
    Commission of Inquiry, could easily have been made when	 the
    petitioner  called upon the Government to let her  know	 the
    reasons why her passport was impounded. [658 A-D]
    In  Satwant  Singh  Sawhney's  case  this  Court  ruled,  by
    majority, that the expression personal liberty which  occurs
    in Art. 21 of the Constitution includes the right to  travel
    abroad	and  that no person can be deprived  of	 that  right
    except according to procedure established by law.  The	mere
    prescription of some kind of procedure cannot even meet	 the
    mandate of Article 21.	The procedure prescribed by law	 has
    to be fair, just and reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or
    arbitrary.  The question whether the procedure prescribed by
    law  which  curtails  or takes	away  the  personal  liberty
    guaranteed  by	Art.  21  is reasonable or  not	 has  to  be
    considered   not   in  the  abstract  or   on	hypothetical
    considerations like the provision for a full-dressed hearing
    as  in a court room trial but in the contest, primarily,  of
    the  purpose  which the Act is intended to  achieve  and  of
    urgent situations which those who are charged with the	duty
    of  administering the Act may be called upon to	 deal  with.
    Secondly, even the fullest compliance with the	requirements
    of  Art.  21 is not the journey's end because  a  law  which
    prescribes  fair and reasonable procedure for curtailing  or
    taking	away  the personal liberty granted by  Art.  21	 has
    still  to meet a possible challenge under the  other  provi-
    sions of the Constitution.  In the Bank Nationalisation case
    the  majority  held that the assumption in A.  K.  Gopalan's
    case  that certain Articles of the Constitution	 exclusively
    deal  with specific matters cannot be accepted	as  correct.
    Though the Bank Nationalisation case was concerned with	 the
    inter-relationship  of Arts. 31 and 19 and not of  Arts.  21
    and  19, the basic approach adopted therein as	regards	 the
    construction   of  fundamental	rights	guaranteed  in	 the
    different  provisions  of  the	Constitution   categorically
    discarded  the	major premise of the  majority	judgment  in
    Gopalan's case. [658 D-G, 659 A-B]
    The  test  of directness of the impugned law  as  contrasted
    with  its consequence was thought in A. K. Gopalan  and	 Ram
    Singh's case to be the true approach for determining whether
    a   fundamental	  right	 was   infringed.    A	 significant
    application  of	 that  test may be perceived  in  Naresh  S.
    Mirajkar's  case  where an order passed by the	Bombay	High
    Court prohibiting the publication of a witness's evidence in
    a  defamation  case was upheld by this Court on	 the  ground
    that  it was passed with the object of affording  protection
    to  the	 witness in order to obtain true  evidence  and	 its
    impact on the right of free speech and expression guaranteed
    by  Art.  19 (1) (a) was incidental.  N. H. Bhagwati  J.  in
    Express	 Newspapers Case struck a modified note by  evolving
    the  test of proximate effect and operation of the  Statute.
    That  test saw its fruition in Sakal Paper's case where	 the
    Court  giving precedence to the direct and immediate  effect
    of the order over the form and object, struck down the Daily
    Newspapers (Price and Page) Order, 1960, on the ground	that
    it  violated  Article  19(1)(a) of  the	 Constitution.	 The
    culmi-
    627
    nation	of  this  thought process was reached  in  the	Bank
    Nationalisation	 case  where it was held  by  the  majority,
    speaking  through  Shah	 J, that the  extent  of  protection
    against the impairment of a fundamental right is  determined
    by  the direct operation of an action upon the	individual's
    rights	and not by the object of the Legislature or  by	 the
    form  of  the action. In Bennett Coleman's  case  the  Court
    reiterated the same position.  It struck down the  newsprint
    policy restricting the number of pages of newspapers without
    the  option to reduce the circulation as  offending  against
    the provisions of Art. 19(1)(a). [659F-H, 660 A-C]
    Article 19(1)(a) guarantees to Indian Citizens the right  to
    freedom	 of speech and expression.  It does not delimit	 the
    grant  of  that right in any manner and there is  no  reason
    arising	 either out of interpretational dogmas or  pragmatic
    considerations why courts should strain the language of	 the
    Article	 to  cut down amplitude of that	 right.	  The  plain
    meaning	  of  the  clause  guaranteeing	 free	speech	 and
    expression is that Indian citizens are entitled to  exercise
    that  right wherever they choose regardless of	geographical
    considerations. [661 A-D]
    The Constitution does not confer any power on the  executive
    to prevent the exercise by an Indian citizen of the right of
    free   speech	and  expression	 on   foreign	soil.	 The
    Constitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms  except
    where	 their	 exercise   is	 limited   by	 territorial
    considerations.	 Those freedoms may be exercised wheresoever
    one  chooses  subject to the  exceptions  or  qualifications
    mentioned  in Art. 19 itself.  The right to go out of  India
    is  not	 an integral part of the right of  free	 speech	 and
    expression.   The  analogy  of the freedom  of	press  being
    included  in  the  right of free speech	 and  expression  is
    wholly	misplaced  because  the	 right	of  free  expression
    incontrovertibly  includes  the right of freedom  of  press.
    The  right  to go abroad on one hand and the right  of	free
    speech and expression on the other are made up basically  of
    constituents so different that one cannot be comprehended in
    the  other.  The presence of the due process clause  in	 the
    5th  and 14th amendments of the American Constitution  makes
    significant difference to the approach of American Judges to
    the definition and evaluation of constitutional	 guarantees.
    This Court rejected the contention that the freedom. to form
    associations or unions contained in Article 19(1)(c) carried
    with  it the right that a workers , union could do all	that
    was  necessary	to  make that right effective  in  order  to
    achieve the purpose for which the union was formed. [See the
    decision in All India Bank Employees Association. [661 F, H,
    662 A-13, E]
    Bhagwati,  J. (for himself Untwalia and Murtaza	 Fazal	Ali,
    JJ)
    The  fundamental  rights  in Part III  of  the	Constitution
    represent  the basic values cherished by the people of	this
    country	 since	the Vedic times and they are  calculated  to
    protect the dignity of the individual and create  conditions
    in  which every human being can develop his  personality  to
    the  fullest extent.  But these freedoms are not and  cannot
    be  absolute, for absolute and unrestricted freedom  of	 one
    may  be	 destructive of the freedom of another.	 In  a	well
    ordered	 civilised  society, freedom can only  be  regulated
    freedom.   It is obvious that Article 21 though	 couched  in
    negative  language  confers fundamental right  to  life	 and
    personal   liberty.    The   question	that   arises	 for
    consideration  on the language of Art. 21 is as to  what  is
    the  meaning and content of the words .personal liberty'  as
    used  in  this Article.	 In A. K. Gopalan's  case  a  narrow
    interpretation	was placed on the words 'personal  liberty.'
    But  there was no definite pronouncement made on this  point
    since  the  question before the court was not  so  much	 the
    interpretation of the words 'personal liberty' as the inter-
    relation  between Arts. 19 and 21. [667 G-H, 668 D-E, G,  H,
    669 A]
    A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras [1950] SCR 88 and  Kharak
    Singh v. State of U. P. & Ors. [1964] 1 SCR 332 referred to.
    In Kharak Singh's case the majority of this Court held	that
    'personal  liberty' is used in the Article as a	 compendious
    term to include within itself all varieties of Tights  which
    go to make up the personal liberties of man other than those
    dealt  with  in	 several  clauses  of  Article	19(1).	 The
    minority however took the view that the expression  personal
    liberty is a comprehensive one and the right to move  freely
    is an attribute of personal liberty.  The minority  observed
    that  it was not right to exclude any attribute of  personal
    liberty from the scope
    628
    and  ambit of Art. 21 on the ground that it was	 covered  by
    Art.  19(1)	  It was pointed out by the,  minority	that
    both Articles 19(1)and	 21  are  independent	fundamental
    rights though there is a certain amountof overlapping;	and
    there is no question of one being carved out of another. The
    minority view  was upheld as correct and it was pointed	 out
    that it wouldnot be tight to read the expression 'personal
    liberty' in Art. 21 in a narrowand  restricted sense  so
    as to exclude those attributes of personal liberty which are
    specifically  dealt with in Art. 19(1).	 The attempt of	 the
    Court  should  be  to expand, the reach	 and  ambit  of	 the
    fundamental  rights rather than attenuate their meaning	 and
    content	  by  a	 process  of  judicial	construction.	 The
    wavelength  for	 comprehending the scope and  ambit  of	 the
    fundamental  rights  has been set by the Court	in  R.	  C.
    Cooper's    case  and  the approach of	the  Court  in,	 the
    interpretation of the fundamental rights must now be in tune
    with this wave length.	The expression 'personal liberty' in
    Art.  21 is of the widest amplitude and covers a variety  of
    rights	which go to constitute the personal liberty  of	 man
    and some of them have been raised to the status of  distinct
    fundamental,  rights and given additional  protection  under
    Art.  19(1).   Thus Articles 19(1) and 21 are  not  mutually
    exclusive. [669 B-670 A-H]

    Shambhu	 Nath  Sarkar  v. The State of West  Bengal  &	Ors.
    applied.
    Haradhan Saha v. The State of West Bengal & Ors. followed.
    This  Court  held  in case of Satwant  Singh  that  personal
    liberty	 within	 the meaning of Art. 21	 includes  with	 its
    ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no person	 can
    be  deprived  of this right except  according  to  procedure
    prescribed  by	law.   Obviously, the  procedure  cannot  be
    arbitary, unfair or unreasonable.  The observations in A. K.
    Gopalan's  case	 support  this view  and  apart	 from  these
    observations, even on principle, the concept of	 reasonable-
    ness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Art.
    21,  having regard to the impact of Art. 14 on Art.21.	[671
    A, D, G-H]
    The  decision  of  the	majority in  A.	 K.  Gopalan's	case
    proceeded  on  the assumption that certain Articles  in	 the
    Constitution  exclusively  deal with  specific	matters	 and
    where  the  requirements  of an	 article  dealing  with	 the
    particular matter in question are satisfied and there is  no
    infringement  of  the fundamental right guaranteed  by	that
    Article,  no  recourse	can be had to  a  fundamental  right
    conferred by another article.  This doctrine of	 exclusivity
    was  overruled by a majority of the Court in R. C.  Cooper's
    case.  The ratio of the majority judgment in R. C.  Cooper's
    case was explained in clear and categorical terms in Shambhu
    Nath Sarkar's case and followed in Haradhan Saha's case	 and
    Khudi Ram Das's case. [672 B-C, G, 673 A]

    The law must therefore be now taken to be well-settled	that
    Article	 21  does not exclude Article 19 and  that  even  if
    there is a law prescribing procedure for depriving a  person
    of  personal liberty and there is consequently no  infringe-
    ment of the fundamental right conferred by Art. 21, such law
    ill  so	 far as it abridges or takes  away  any	 fundamental
    right  under Article 19 would have to meet the challenge  of
    that Article.  Equally such law would be liable to be tested
    with reference to Art. 14 and the procedure prescribed by it
    would  have to answer the requirement of that Article.	[673

    435 referred to.
    Article	 14 is a founding faith of the Constitution.  It  is
    indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation  of
    our democratic republic and, therefore, it
    62 9
    must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic
    approach.   No	attempt should be made to truncate  its	 all
    embracing  scope  and  meaning, for to do  so  would  be  to
    violate	 its magnitude.	 Equality is a dynamic concept	with
    many  aspects  and dimensions and it  cannot  be  imprisoned
    within traditional and doctrinaire limits. [673 H, 674 A]
    E.P.  Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu & Another	[1974]	2
    SCR 348 applied.
    Equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to
    the  rule of law in a republic while the other to  the	whim
    and  caprice of an absolute monarch.  Article 14 strikes  at
    arbitrariness  in  State  action and  ensures  fairness	 and
    equality  ,of  treatment.  The principle  of  reasonableness
    which  legally as well as philosophically, is  an  essential
    element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14
    like a brooding omni-presence and the procedure contemplated
    by  Article  21 must answer the test  of  reasonableness  in
    order to be in conformity with Article
    14.  It	 must be right and just and fair and not  arbitrary,
    fanciful or oppressive.
    [674 B-C]
    It  is	true  that the Passports Act does  not	provide	 for
    giving reasonable opportunity to the holder of the  passport
    to  be heard in advance before impounding a  passport.	 But
    that is not conclusive of the question.	 If the statute make
    itself clear onthis point, then no more question arises
    but even when statute is silent the lawmay in a given  case
    make an implication and apply the principle. Naturaljustice
    is a great humanising principle intended to invest law	with
    fairness  and  to secure justice and over the years  it	 has
    grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas  of
    administrative	action.	 [674  F-G,  675  A-B]	Wiseman	  v.
    Borneman [1971] A.C. 297 approved.
    Schmidt	 v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs	 [1968]	 112

    There  can  be	no  distinction	 between  a   quasi-judicial
    function  and an administrative function for the purpose  of
    principles   of	  natural   justice.   The   aim   of	both
    administrative inquiry as well as the quasi-judicial enquiry
    is  to	arrive at a just decision and if a rule	 of  natural
    justice	 is  calculated	 to  secure justice  or	 to  put  it
    'negatively,  to  prevent  miscarriage	of  justice,  it  is
    difficult  to  see  why it should be  applicable  to  quasi-
    judicial enquiry and not to administrative enquiry.  It must
    logically  apply  to  both.   It cannot	 be  said  that	 the
    requirements  of  fairplay in action is any the less  in  an
    administrative	 enquiry  than	in  a  quasi-judicial	one.
    Sometimes  an unjust decision in an  administrative  enquiry
    may have far more serious consequences than a decision in  a
    quasi-judicial	enquiry and hence rules of  natural  justice
    must  apply,  equally  in an  administrative  enquiry  which
    entails civil consequences. [676 G-H, 677 A]

    The duty to act judicially need not be superadded but it may

    The  law is not well settled that even in an  administrative
    proceeding which involves civil consequences the doctrine of
    natural justice must be held to be applicable. [680 A]
    The power conferred on the Passport Authority is to  impound
    a  passport  and the consequence of  impounding	 a  passport
    would be to impair the constitutional right of the holder of
    the passport to go abroad during the time that the  passport
    is impounded.  The passport can be impounded only on certain
    specified grounds set out in section 10(3) and the  Passport
    Authority  would  have to apply its mind to  the  facts	 and
    circumstances of a given case and decide whether any of	 the
    specified  grounds exists which would Justify impounding  of
    the passport.  The authority is also required by s. 10(5) to
    record	in  writing  a brief statement of  the	reasons	 for
    making	the order impounding a passport and save in  certain
    exceptional situations, the authority is obliged to' furnish
    a  copy	 of the statement of reasons to the  holder  of	 the
    passport.  Where the Passport Authority which has  impounded
    a  passport is other than the Central Government a right  of
    appeal against the order impounding the passport is given by
    section	 11.   Thus,  the power conferred  on  the  Passport
    Authority  to impound a passport is a  quasijudicial  power.
    The  rules of natural justice would in the circumstances  be
    applicable  in	the exercise of the power  of  impounding  a
    passport even on the orthodox view which prevailed prior  to
    A.  K. Kraipak's case.	The same result must follow in	view
    of  the decision in A. K. Kraipak's case, even if the  power
    to  impound  a passport were regarded as  administrative  in
    character,   because  it  seriously  interferes	  with	 the
    constitutional	right  of the holder of the passport  to  go
    abroad and entails adverse civil consequences.	The argument
    of  the Attorney General however was that having  regard  to
    the  nature  of the action involved in the impounding  of  a
    passport,  the audi alteram partem rule must be held  to  be
    excluded because if notice were to be given to the holder of
    the  passport and reasonable opportunity afforded to him  to
    show cause why his passport should not be impounded he might
    immediately  on the strength of the passport make  good	 his
    exit  from  the country and the object of  impounding  etc.,
    would be frustrated.  Now it is true that there may be cases
    where,	having	regard	to the nature of the  action  to  be
    taken, its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant
    statutory   provision,	fairness  in  action   may   warrant
    exclusion  of the audi alteram partem rule.   Indeed,  there
    are  certain wellrecognised exceptions to the  audi  alteram
    Partem	rule  established  by  judicial	 decisions.    These
    exceptions, do not in any way militate against the principle
    which requires fair play in administrative action.  The word
    exception is really a misnomer because in these	 exceptional
    cases the audi alteram partem rule is held inapplicable	 not
    by  way	 of an exception to fairplay in action	but  because
    nothing	 unfair	 can  be  inferred  by	not  conferring	  an
    opportunity to present or meet a case.	The life of the	 law
    is  not	 logic	but  experience.   Therefore,  every   legal
    proposition  must in the ultimate analysis be tested  on  Me
    touch-stone of pragmatic realism. [680 B-F, H, 681 C-F]
    The  audi  alteram  partem  rule  may,	therefore,  by	 the
    experiential test, be excluded, if importing the right to be
    heard  has  the	 effect	 of  paralysing	 the  administrative
    process	 or the need for promptitude or the urgency  of	 the
    situation  so  demands.	 But, at the same time, it  must  be
    remembered  that this is a rule of vital importance  in	 the
    field  of administrative law and it must not  be  jettisoned
    save  in  very exceptional  circumstances  where  Compulsive
    necessity  so demands.	It is a wholesome rule	designed  to
    secure the rule of law and the Court should not be too ready
    to eschew it in its application to a given case.  The  Court
    must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to	 the
    maximum	 extent	 permissible  in a  given  case.   The	audi
    alteram	 partem	 rule  is  not cast in	a  rigid  mould	 and
    judicial decisions establish that it may stiffer situational
    modifications.	 The  core  of	it  must,  however,  remain,
    namely,	 that  the  person  affected  must  have  reasonable
    opportunity'  of  being	 heard and the hearing	must  be  a
    genuine hearing and not an empty public relations  exercise.
    It  would, not therefore be right to conclude that the	audi
    alteram partem? rule is excluded merely because the power to
    impound a passport might be frustrated, if prior notice	 and
    hearing	 were  to be given to the  person  concerned  before
    impounding his passport.  The passport Authority may proceed
    to impound the passport without giving any prior opportunity
    to  the	 person concerned to be heard, but as  soon  as	 the
    order impounding
    631
    the Passport is made, an opportunity of hearing, remedial in
    aim, should be given to him so that he may present his	case
    and controvert that of the
    Passport Authority and point out why his passport should not
    be  impounded  and the order impounding it  recalled.	This
    should	not  only be possible but  also	 quite	appropriate,
    because the reasons for impounding the passport are required
    to be supplied by the Passport Authority after the making of
    the order and the person affected would, therefore, be in  a
    position to make a representation setting forth his case and
    plead for setting aside the action impounding his  passport.
    A fair opportunity of being heard following immediately upon
    the order impounding the Passport would satisfy the  mandate
    of natural justice and a provision requiring giving of	such
    opportunity  to the person concerned can and should be	read
    by  implication in the Passports Act.  If such	a  provision
    were  held  to	be  incorporated in  the  Act  by  necessary
    implication   the  procedure  prescribed  by  the  Act	 for
    impounding  a  passport would be right, fair  and  just	 and
    would  not  suffer from	 arbitrainess  or  unreasonableness.
    Therefore, the procedure established by the Passport Act for
    impounding a passport must be held to be in conformity	with
    the  requirement of Art. 21 and does not fall foul  of	that
    Article. [681 G-H, 682 A-C, E-H, 683 A-B]
    In  the	 present case, however, the Central  Government	 not
    only  did  not	give  an  opportunity  of  hearing  of	 the
    petitioner  after making the impugned order  impounding	 her
    passport but even declined to furnish to the petitioner	 the
    reasons for impounding her passport despite requests made by
    her.   The  Central  Government was  wholly  unjustified  in
    withholding the reasons for impounding the passport and this
    was  not only in breach of the statutory provisions  but  it
    also  amounted	to denial of opportunity of hearing  to	 the
    petitioner.   The  order  impounding  the  passport  of	 the
    petitioner was, therefore, clearly in violation of the	rule
    of natural justice embodied in the maxim audi alteram partem
    and  was not in conformity with the procedure prescribed  by
    the  Act.   The learned Attorney General,  however,  made  a
    statement  on  behalf of the Government of  India  that	 the
    Government  was agreeable to considering any  representation
    that  may  be  made  by the petitioner	in  respect  of	 the
    impounding of her passport and giving her an opportunity  in
    the matter, and that the representation would be dealt	with
    expeditiously  in  accordance  with  law.   This   statement
    removes the vice from the order impounding the passport	 and
    it can no longer be assailed on the ground that it does	 not
    comply with the audi alteram partem rule or is not in accord
    with the procedure prescribed by the Act. [683 C-G]
    The  law is well settled that when a statute vests  unguided
    and unrestricted power in an authority to affect the  rights
    of  a  person without laying down any  policy  or  principle
    which is to guide the authority,, in exercise of the  power,
    it would be affected by the vice of discrimination since  it
    would leave it open to the authority to discriminate between
    persons	 and  things  similarly situated.   However,  it  is
    difficult  to  say  that the  discretion  conferred  on	 the
    passport  authority is arbitrary or unfettered.	  There	 are
    four grounds set out in section 10(3)(c) which would justify
    the making of an order impounding a passport. [684C-D]
    The words "in the interest of the general public" cannot  be
    characterised as vague or undefined.  The expression "in the
    interest  of the general public" has clearly a well  defined
    meaning and the Courts have often been called upon to decide
    whether	 a particular action is in the interest	 of  general
    public	or  in public interest and no  difficulty  has	been
    experienced  by	 the Courts in carrying out  this  exercise.
    These  words are in fact borrowed ipsissima verba  from	 Art
    19(5) and it would be nothing short of heresay to accuse the
    constitution makers of vague and loose thinking.  Sufficient
    guidelines  are	 provided by the Act itself  and  the  power
    conferred  on the Passport Authority to impound	 a  passport
    cannot	be said to be unguided or unfettered.  Moreover	 the
    exercise  of  this  power  is  not  made  dependent  on	 the
    subjective opinion of the Passport Authority as regards	 the
    necessity of exercising it on one or more grounds stated  in
    S.10(3)(c), but the Passport Authority is required to record
    in  writing a brief statement of reasons for impounding	 the
    passport  and  save in	certain	 exceptional  circumstances,
    supply	a  copy of such statement of reasons to	 the  person
    affected  so  that the person concerned	 can  challenge	 the
    decision of the Passport Authority in appeal and the  Appel-
    late Authority can examine whether the reasons given by	 the
    Passport Autho-
    632
    rity  are correct and if so whether they justify the  making
    of the order impounding the passport.  It is true that	when
    the  order  impounding the passport is made by	the  Central
    Government  there is no appeal against it.  But it  must  be
    remembered that in such a case the power is exercised by the
    Central Government itself and it can safely be assumed	that
    the  Central Govt. will exercise the power in  a  reasonable
    and  responsible  manner.  When power is vested	 in  a	high
    authority like the Central Government abuse of power  cannot
    be  lightly assumed and in any event, if there is  abuse  if
    the power the arms of the Court are long enough to reach  it
    and to strike it down.	The power conferred on the  Passport
    Authority  to  impound a passport under	 section  10(3)	 (c)
    cannot be regarded as discriminatory. [684-D-H, 685 A-C]
    The  law on the point viz. the proper test or yard-stick  to
    be  applied  for determining whether a statute	infringes  a
    particular   fundamental   right,   while   adjudging	 the
    constitutionality   of	a  statute  on	the  touchstone	  of
    fundamental  rights has undergone radical changes since	 the
    days  of  A.K.	Gopalan's  case [1950]	SCR  88,  which	 was
    followed in Ram Singh and Ors. v. State of Delhi [1951]	 SCR
    451 and applied in Naresh Shridhar Mirajikar & Ors. v. State
    of Maharashtra & Anr. [1966] 3 SCR 744, [685 D-G, 686-B]
    According to these decisions, the theory was that the object
    and form of state action determine the extent of  protection
    which  may be claimed by an individual and the	validity  of
    such  action has to be judged by considering whether  it  is
    "directly   in	respect	 of  the  subject  covered  by	 any
    particular  article of the Constitution or touches the	said
    article	 only incidentally or indirectly".  The test  to  be
    applied for determining the constitutional validity of state
    action	with fundamental right therefore was : what  is	 the
    object	of the authority in taking the action : What is	 the
    subject matter of the action and to which fundamental  right
    does it relate ? This theory that "the extent of  protection
    of important guarantees, such as the liberty of persons	 and
    right  to property, depend upon the form and object  of	 the
    state  action  not  upon  its  direct  operation  upon	 the
    individual's freedom" held sway, in spite of three decisions
    of the Supreme Court in Dwarkadass Srinivas v. The  Sholapur
    Weaving Co. Ltd. [1954] SCR 674; Express Newspaper (P)	Ltd.
    JUDGMENT:
    

Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India [1962] 3 SCR 842 formulating the test of direct
and inevitable effect or the doctrine of intended and real effect for the
purpose of adjudging whether a statute offends a particular fundamental right.
However, it was only in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India [1973] 3 SCR 530 that
the doctrine that the object and form of the State action alone determine the
extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual and that the effect
of the State action on the fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant
as laid down in Gopalan's case was finally rejected. This doctrine is in
substance and reality nothing else than the test of pith and substance which
is applied for determining the constitutionality of legislation where there is
conflict of legislative powers conferred on Federal and State legislatures
with reference to legislative lists. [685 H, 686 A-B, D-H, 687 A-E, F-G] The
test applied since R.C. Cooper's case was as to what is the direct and
inevitable consequence or effect of the impugned state action on the
fundamental right of the petitioner. It is possible that in a given case the
pith and substance of the State action may deal with a particular fundamental
right but its direct and inevitable effect may be on another fundamental right
and in that case, the state action would have to meet the challenge of the
latter fundamental right. The pith and substance doctrine looks only at the
object and subject matter of the state action, but in testing the validity of
the state action with reference to fundamental rights, what the Courts must
consider is the direct and inevitable consequence of the State action.
Otherwise the protection of the fundamental rights would subtly but surely
eroded. [690 B-D] A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras [1950] 2 SCR 88; Ram Singh
& Ors. V. State of Delhi [1951] SCR 451; Naresh Sridhar Marajkar & Ors. V.
State of Maharashtra & Anr. [1966] 3 SCR 744 referred to. R. C. Cooper v.
Union of India [1973] 3 SCR 530; Dwarakadass Srinivas v. the Sholapur and
Weaving Co. Ltd. [1954] SCR 674; Express Newspaper (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of
India, [1959] S.C.R. 12 and Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of 633 India
[1962] 3 SCR 842; quoted with approval, Bennet Coleman & Co. v. Union of India
[1973] 2 SCR 757 applied. The test formulated in R. C. Cooper's case merely
refers to "direct operation" or "direct consequence and effect" of the State
action on the fundamental right of the petitioner and does not use the word
"inevitable" in this connection. If the test were merely of direct or indirect
effect, it would be an open-ended concept and in the absence of operational
criteria for judging "directness" it would give the Court an unquestionable
discretion to decide whether in a given case a consequence or effect is direct
or not. Some other concept-vehicle would be needed to quantify the extent of
directness or indirectness in order to apply the test. And that is supplied by
the criterion of "inevitable" consequence or effect adumbrated in the Express
Newspaper case (1959) SCR 12. This criterion helps to quantify the extent of
directness necessary to constitute infringement of a fundamental right. Now,
if the effect of State action on a fundamental right is direct and inevitable,
then a fortiorari it must be presumed to have been intended by the authority
taking the action and hence this doctrine of direct and inevitable effect is
described aptly as the doctrine of intended and real effect. This is the test
which must be applied for the purpose of determining whether section 10(3)(c),
or the impugned order made under it is violated of Art. 19(1)(a) or (g). [698
C-F] Prima facie, the right which is sought to be restricted by s. 10(3)(c)
and the impugned order is the right to go abroad and that is not named as a
fundamental right or included in so many words in Art. 19(1)(a) of the
Constitution. The right to go abroad, as held in Satwant Singh Sawhney's case
[1967] 3 SCR 525, is included in "personal liberty" within the meaning of Art.
21 and is thus a fundamental right protected by that Article. This clearly
shows that there is no underlying principle in the Constitution which, limits
the fundamental right in their operation to the territory of India. If a
fundamental right under Art. 21 can be exercisable outside India, there is no
reason why freedom of speech and expression conferred under 19(1)(a) cannot be
so exercisable. [690 H, 694 C-D] Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam,
Asstt. Possport Officer, Govt. of India, New Delhi & Ors., [1967] 3 SCR 525;
Best v. United States, 184 Federal Reporter (ed) p 131, referred to. Dr. S. S.
Sadashiva Rao V. Union of India [1965] Mysore Law Journal p. 605 approved.
There are no geographical limitations to freedom of speech and expression
guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (a) and this freedom is exercisable not only in
India but also outside and if State action sets up barriers to its citizens'
freedom of expression in any country in the world, it would violate Art. 19(1)
(a) as much as if it inhibited such expression within the country. This
conclusion would on a parity of reasoning apply equally in relation to
fundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation,
trade or business, guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g). [694G-H, 695 A] Freedom to
go abroad incorporates the important function of an ultimum refunium liberatis
when other basic freedoms are refused. Freedom to go abroad has much social
value and represents a basic human right of great significance. It is in fact
incorporated as in alienable human right in Article 13 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. But it is not specifically named as a fundamental
right in Art. 19(1) of the Constitution. [696 C-D] Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116
: 2 L.ed 2d, 1204 referred to. Even if a right is not specifically named in
Art. 19(1) it may still be a fundamental right covered by some clause of that
Article, if it is an integral part of a named fundamental right or partakes of
the same basic nature and character as that fundamental right. It is not
enough that a right claimed by the petitioner flows or emanates from a named
fundamental right or that its existence, is necessary in order to make the
exercise of the named fundamental right meaningful and effective. Every
activity which facilitates the exercise of a named fundamental right is not
necessarily comprehended in that fundamental right, nor can it be regarded as
such merely because it may not be possible otherwise to effectively exercise
that fundamental right.

634

What is necessary to be seem is and that is the test which must be applied,
whether the right claimed by the petitioner is an, integral part of a named
fundamental right or partakes of the same basic nature and character as the
named fundamental, right is in reality and substance nothing but an instance
of the exercise of, the named fundamental right. If this be the correct test,
the right to go abroad cannot in all circumstances be regarded as included in
freedom of speech and expression. [697 D-G] Kent v. Dulles, 357 US. 116. 2
L.ed 2d. 1204 : Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.
[1959] SCR 12; Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India [1962] 3 SCR
842; Bennet Coleman & Co. & Ors. v. Union of India [1973] 2 SCR 757; Ramesh
Thappar v. State of Madras [1950] SCR 594 referred to. Apthekar v. Secretary
of State 378 US 500 : 12 L.ed 2d 992; Zamei v. Rusk 381 USI : 14 L.ed 2d 179
explained.

The theory that a peripheral or concomitant right which facilitates the
exercise of a named fundamental right or gives its meaning and substance or
makes its exercise effective, is itself a guaranteed right included within the
named fundamental right cannot be accepted. [701 B-C] All India Bank
Employees' Association v. National Industrial Tribunal [1962] 3 SCR 269
applied.

The right to go abroad cannot therefore be regarded as included in freedom of
speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) on the theory of
peripheral or concomitant right. The right to go abroad cannot be treated as
part of the right to carry on trade, business or profession or calling
guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g). The right to go abroad is clearly not a
guaranteed right under any clause of Article 19(1) and Section 10(3) (c) which
authorises imposition of restrictions on the right to go abroad by impounding
of passport cannot be held as void as offending Article 19(1)(a) or (g), as
its direct and inevitable impact is on the right to go abroad and not on the
right of free speech and expression or the right to carry on trade, business,
profession or calling. [702 C-E] But that does not mean that an order made
under s. 10 (3) (c) may not violate Article 19(1)(a) or (g). Where a statutory
provision empowering an authority to take action is constitutionally valid,
action taken under it may offend a fundamental right and in that event, though
the statutory provision is valid, the action may be void. Therefore, even
though section 10(3)(c) is valid, the question would always remain whether an
order made under it invalid as contravening a fundamental right. The direct
and inevitable effect of an order impounding a passport may, in a given case,
be to abridge or take away freedom of speech and expression or the right to
carry on a profession and where such is the case, the order would be invalid,
unless saved by Article 19(2) or Article 19(6). [702F-H] Narendra Kumar & Ors.
v. Union of India & Ors., [1960] 2 SCR 375 referred to.

Though the impugned order may be within the terms of s. 10(3) (c), it must
nevertheless not contravene any fundamental right and if it does, it would be
void. Now, even if an order impounding a passport is made in the interests of
public order decency or morality, the restriction imposed by it may be so
wide, excessive disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought to be averted
that it may be considered unreasonable and in that event, if the direct and
inevitable consequence of the order is to abridge or take away freedom of
speech and expression, it would be violative of Article 19(1)(a) and would not
be protected by Article 19(2) and the same would, be the position where the
order is in the interests of the general public but it infringes directly and
inevitably on the freedom to carry on a profession in which case it would
contravene Article 19(1) (g) without being saved by the provision enacted ion
Article 19(6). [705 D-E] 6 3 5 The impugned order, in the present case does
riot Violate either Art. 19(1)(a) or Art. 19(1)(g). What the impugned order
does is to impound the passport of the petitioner and thereby prevent her from
going abroad and at the date, when impugned order was made, there is nothing
to show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of
exercising her freedom or speech and expression or her right to carry on her
profession as a journalist. The direct and inevitable consequence of the
impugned order was to impede the exercise of her right to go abroad and not to
interfere with her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on
her profession. [706 F-G] The petitioner is not justified in seeking to limit
the expression "interests of the general public" to matters relating to
foreign affairs. The argument that the said expression could not cover a
situation where the presence of a person is required to give evidence before a
commission of Inquiry_ is plainly erroneous as it seeks to cut down the width
and amplitude of the expression "interests of the general public," an
expression which has a well recognised legal connotation and which is found in
Article 19(5) as well as Article 19(6). It is true that that there is always a
perspective within which a statute is intended to operate, but that does not
justify reading of a statutory provision in a manner not warranted by the
language or narrowing down its scope and meaning by introducing a limitation
which has no basis either in the, language or in the context of a statutory
provision Clauses (d), (e) and (h) of  S. 10(3) make it clear that there are
several grounds in this section which do not relate to foreign affairs. [709
B-F] Moreover the present case is not one where the maxim "expressio unius
exclusio ulterius has any application at all. [710-B-C] Rohtas Industries Ltd.
v. S. O. Agarwal & Anr., [1969] 3 SCR 108 @ 128 referred to.

OBSERVATION It is true that the power under s. 10(3) (c) is rather a drastic
power to interfere with a basic human right, but this power has been conferred
by the legislature in public interest and there is no doubt that it will be
sparingly used and that too, with great care and circumspection and as far as
possible. the passport of a person will not be impounded merely on the ground
of his being required in connection with a proceeding, unless the case is
brought within s. 10(3)(e) or sec. 10(3)(b). [710G-H] Ghani v. Jones [1970] I
Q. B 693 quoted with approval. An order impounding a passport can be made by
the Passport Authority only if it is actually in the interests of the general
public to do so and it is not enough that the interests of the general public
may be likely to be served in future by the making of the order. In the
present case, it was not merely on the future likelihood of the interests of
the general public being advanced that the impugned order was made by the
Central Government. The impugned order was made because, in the opinion of the
Central Govt. the presences of the petitioner was necessary for giving
evidence before the Commission of Inquiry and according to the report received
by the Central Government she was likely to leave India and that might
frustrate or impede to some extent the inquiries which were being conducted by
the Com- missions of Inquiry. [711-C-D] Krishna lyer, J. (concurring with
Bhagwati, J.) British Raj has frowned on foreign travels by Indian patriotic
suspects and instances from the British Indian Chapter may abound. In many
countries the 636 passport and visa system has been used as potent paper
curtain to inhibit illustrious writers, outstanding statesmen, humanist
churchmen and renowned scientists, if they are dissenters, from leaving their
national frontiers. Things have changed, global awareness has dawned. The
European Convention on Human Rights and bilateral understandings have made
headway to widen freedom of travel abroad as integral to liberty of the
person. And the universal Declaration of Human Rights has proclaimed in
Article 13, that every one has the right to leave any country including his
own, and to return to his country. This human planet is our single home,
though geographically variegated, culturally diverse, politically pluralist in
science and technology competitive and co-operative in arts and life-styles a
lovely mosaic and, above all, suffused with a cosmic unconsciousness of unity
and inter- dependence. [717 B, C, D, E-F] Viewed from another angle, travel
abroad is a cultural enrichment which enables one's understanding of one's own
country in better light. Thus it serves national interest to have its
citizenry see other countries and judge one's country on a comparative scale.
[718 B] The right of free movement is a vital element of personal liberty. The
right of free movement includes right to travel abroad. Among the great
guaranteed rights life and liberty are the first among equals, carrying a
universal connotation cardinal to a decent human order and protected by
constitutional armour. Truncate liberty in Art. 21 traumatically and the
several other freedoms fade out automatically. [720 A-B] Personal liberty
makes for the worth of the human person. Travel makes liberty worthwhile. life
is a terrestrial opportunity for unfolding personality rising to a higher
scale moving to fresh woods and reaching out to reality which makes our
earthly journey a true fulfilment, not a tale told by an idiot full of sound
and fury signifying nothing, but a fine frenzy rolling between heaven and
earth. The spirit of Man is at the root of Art. 21 Absent liberty, other
freedoms are frozen. [721 C-F] Procedure which deals with the modalities of
regulating, restricting or even rejecting a fundamental right falling within
Article 21 has to be fair, not foolish, carefully designed to effectuate, not
to subvert, the substantive right itself. Thus, understood, 'procedure' must
rule out anything arbitrary, freakish or bizarre. What is fundamental is life
and liberty. What is procedural is the manner of its exercise. This quality of
fairness in the process is emphasised by the strong word "establish" which
means 'settled firmly'," not wantonly or whimsically. [722 H, 723 A-B]
Procedure in Article 21 means fair, not formal procedure. Law is reasonable
law, not any enacted piece. As Art. 22 specifically spells out the procedural
safeguards for preventive and punitive detention, a law providing for such
detention should conform to Art. 22. It has been rightly pointed out that for
other rights forming part of personal liberty, the procedural safeguards
enshrined in Art. 21 are available. Otherwise, as the procedural safeguards
contained in Art. 22 will be available only in cases of preventive and
punitive detention the right to life, more fundamental than any other forming
part of personal liberty and paramount to the happiness, dignity and worth of
the individual, will not be entitled to any procedural safeguard, save such as
a legislature's mood chooses. [723 F-H] Kochunmi's case (AIR 1960 SC 1080,
1093) referred. Liberty of locomotion into alien territory cannot be unjustly
forbidden by the Establishment and passport legislation must take processual
provisions which accord with fair norms, free from extraneous pressure and, by
and large, complying with natural justice. Unilateral arbitrariness, police
dossiers, faceless affiants, behind- the-back materials oblique motives and
the inscrutable face of an official sphinx do not fill the 'fairness,' bill.
[726 D-E] Article 21 clubs life with liberty and when we interpret the colour
and content of 'procedure established by law', we must be alive to the deadly
peril of 637 life being deprived without minimal processual justice,
legislative callousness despising hearing and fair opportunities of defence.
[726 F] Sections 5, 6 and 10 of the impugned legislation must be tested even
under Art. 21 on canons of processual justice to the people outlined above.
Hearing is obligatory-meaningful hearing, flexible and realistic, according to
circumstances' but not ritualistic and wooden. In exceptional cases and
emergency situations, interim measures may be taken, to avoid the mischief of
the passportee becoming an. escapee before the hearing begins. "Bolt the
stables after the horse has been stolen" is not a command of natural justice.
But soon after the provisional seizure, a reasonable hearing must follow, to
minimise procedural prejudice. And when a prompt final order is made against
the applicant or passport holder the reasons must be disclosed to him almost
invariably save in those dangerous cases, where irreparable injury will ensue
to the State. A government which revels in secrecy in the field of people's
liberty not only acts against democratic decency but busies itself with its
own burial. That is the writing on the wall if history were teacher, memory
our mentor and decline of liberty not our unwitting endeavour. Public power
must rarely hide its heart in an open society and system. [727 F-H] Article 14
has a pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its
soul and allergic to discriminatory diktats. Equality is the antithesis of
arbitrariness. [728 A] As far as question of extra-territorial jurisdiction in
foreign lands is concerned, it is a misconception. Nobody contends that India
should interfere with other countries and their sovereignty to ensure free
movement of Indians in those countries. What is meant is that the Government
of India should not prevent by any sanctions it has over its citizens from
moving within in any other country if that other country has no objection to
their travelling within its territory. [728 C] In Gopalan's case it was held
that Art. 22 is a self- contained Code, however, 'this has suffered
supersession at. the hands of R. C. Cooper. [728 D] Sakal Newspapers [1962] 3
SCR 842, Cooper [1973] 3 SCR 530. Bennet Coleman [1973] 2 SCR 759 and Shambu
Nath Sarkar [1973] 1 SCR 856 referred to.

The law is now settled that no article in Part III is an island but Part of a
continent, and the conspectus of the whole part gives the direction and
correction needed for interpretation of these basic provisions. Man is not
dissectible into separate limbs and, likewise, cardinal rights in an organic
constitution, which make man human have a synthesis. The proposition is
indubitable that Art. 21 does not, in a given situation exclude Art. 19 if
both rights are breached. It is a salutary thought that the summit court
should not interpret constitutional rights enshrined in Part III to choke its
life-breath or chill its elan vital by processes of legalism, overruling the
enduring values burning in the bosoms of those who won our independence and
drew up our founding document. [728 F-G, 729 A-B] High constitutional policy
has harmonised individual freedoms with holistic community good by inscribing
exceptions to Art. 19(1) in Art 19(2) to (6). Even so, what is fundamental is
the freedom, not the exception. More im- portantly, restraints are permissible
only to the extent they have nexus with the approved object. No verbal labels
but real values are the governing considerations in the exploration and
adjudication of constitutional prescriptions and proscriptions. Governments
come and go, but the fundamental rights of the people cannot be subject to the
wishful value-sets of political regimes of the passing day. [729 C-D, 730 F]
Locomotion in some situation is necessarily involved in the exercise of the
specified fundamental rights as an associated or integrated right. Travel,
simpliciter, is peripheral to and not necessarily fundamental in Art. 19 Free
speech is feasible without movement beyond country. [731 B] The delicate, yet
difficult, phase of the controversy arrives where free speech and free
practice of profession are inextricably interwoven with travel abroad.

638

One, has to view the proximate and real consequence of thwarting transnational
travel through the power of the State exercised under s. 3 of the Passport Act
read with ss. 5 and 6. Associated rights totally integrated with fundamental
rights must enjoy the same immunity. Three sets of cases might arise. First,
where the legislative provision or executive' order expressly forbids exercise
in foreign lands of the-fundamental right while granting passport. Secondly,
there may be cases where even if the order is innocent on its face, the
refusal of permission to go to a foreign country may, with certainty and
immediacy, spell denial of free speech and professional practice or business.
Thirdly, the fundamental right may itself enwomb locomotion regardless of
national frontiers. The second and third often are blurred in their edges and
may overlap. [732 H, 733 A-C] Spies, traitors, smugglers, saboteurs of the
health, wealth and survival or sovereignty of the nation shall not be
passported into hostile soil to work their vicious plan fruitfully. But when
applying the Passports Act, Over- breadth, hyper-anxiety, regimentation
complex, and political mistrust shall not sub-consciously exaggerate, into
morbid or neurotic refusal or unlimited imponding or final revocation of
passport, facts which, objectively assessed, may prove tremendous trifles.
That is why the provisions have to be read down into constitutionality,
tailored to fit the reasonableness test and humanised by natural justice. The
Act willsurvive but the order shall perish for reasons so fully set out by
Shri JusticeBhagwati. And on this construction, the conscience of the
Constitution triumphs over vagarious governmental orders. [734 E-G-H]
Kailasam, J. (Dissenting) The preamble to the Constitution provides that the
people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign,
socialist, secular and democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens,
justice, social, economic and political, liberty of thought, expression,
belief, faith and worship, equality of status and of opportunity. Article 12
defines the State as including the Government and Parliament of India and the
Government and the Legislature of each of the States and of local or other
authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the
Government of India. Article 13 provides that laws that are inconsistent with
or in derogation of fundamental rights are to that ex- tent void. Article
245(2) provides that no law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid
on the ground that it would have extra territorial operation. In England
section 3 of the Statute of Westminster declares that Parliament has full
power to make laws having extra territorial operation. The following are the
principles to determine whether the provisions of a Constitution or a Statute
have extra territorial application.

(a)An Act unless it provides otherwise applies only to the country concerned.

(b) An Act of a Legislature will bind the subjects of the realm both within
and without if that is the intention of the Legislature, which must be
gathered from the language of the Act in question.

(c) Legislature normally restricts operation of legislation to its own
territories. However, on occasions legislation controlling the activities of
its own citizens when they are abroad may be passed.

Niboyet v. Niboyet 48 L.J.P.I. at p. 10 and Queen v. Jameson and Others [1896]
2 Q.B. Division 425 at 430 referred to.

(d) In the absence of an intention clearly expressed or to be inferred from
its language, or from the object or subject matter or history of the
enactment, the presumption is that Parliament does not design its statute to
operate beyond the territorial limit of the country.

The application of Article 14 is expressly limited to the territory of India
Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 22 by their very nature are confined to the
territory of India. Articles 23 to 28 are applicable only to the territory of
India At any rate, there is no intention in these Articles indicating extra-
territorial application. So also Articles 29 and 30 which deal with cultural
and educational rights are applicable only within the territory of India.
Article 31 does not expressly or impliedly have any extra- territorial
application. It is possible that the right conferred by Article 19(1)(a) may
have extra-territorial application. It is not likely, however, that the
framers of the Constitution intended the right to assemble peaceably and
without arms or to form associations or unions or to acquire, hold and dispose
of property, or to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation,
trade or business, to have any extra-territorial application for such rights
would not- be enforced by the State outside the Indian territory. The rights
conferred under Article 19 are fundamental rights and Arts. 32 & 226 provide,
that those rights are guaranteed and can be enforced by the aggrieved person
by approaching this Court or the High Courts. These rights cannot be protected
by the State outside its territory and, therefore, there is a presumption that
the constitution makers would not have intended to guarantee any rights which
the State cannot enforce. [742 H, 743 A-D-E-F] Virendra v. The State of Punjab
and Another, [1958] SCR 308 referred to.

It is most unlikely that before the declaration of human rights was
promulgated the framers of the Constitution decided to declare that the
fundamental rights conferred on the citizens would, be available even outside
India. Even in the American Constitution there is no mention of right to
freedom of speech or expressions as being available outside America. The law
made under Article 19(2) to 19(6) imposes restrictions on the exercise of
right of freedom of speech and expression etc. The restrictions thus imposed
normally would apply only within the territory of India unless the legislation
expressly or by necessary implication provides for extra-territorial
operation. In the penal code, section 3 and 4 specifically provides that
crimes committed by citizens of India outside India are punishable. In Article
19, however, there is no such provision expressly or by necessary implication.
Secondly, a citizen cannot enforce his fundamental rights outside the
territory of India even if it is taken that such rights are available outside
the country. Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that by denying the
passport the petitioner's fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 19 are
infringed cannot be accepted. [744 H, 745 A-D, 746 F-G, H, 747 A] The
important question which arises, is whether an Act passed under Article 21
should also satisfy requirements of Article 19. It has been decided by this
,Court in Gopalan's case that the punitive detention for offences under the
Penal Code cannot be challenged on the ground that it infringes fundamental
rights under Article 19. [747 E-F] The rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)
are subject to restrictions that may be placed by Articles 19(2) to 19(6). The
right not to be deprived of life and personal liberty is subject to its
deprivation by procedure established 'by law. In Gopalan's case it was held
that Article 19 dealt with the rights of the citizens when he was free and
would not apply to person who had ceased to be free and has been either under
punitive or preventive detention. It was further held that Article 19 only
applied where a legislation directly hit the rights enumerated in the Article
and not where the loss of rights mentioned .in the Article was a result of the
operation of legislation relating to punitive or preventive detention. The
aforesaid ratio of Gopalan's case has been confirmed by this, Court in Ram
Singh v. State of Delhi. The view was again confirmed in the State of Bihar v.
kameshwar Singh. [749C,750B-G] Ram Singh v. State of Delhi [1951] SCR 451 and
State of Bihar v. Kameshwar 'Singh [1952] SCR 889 relied on. In Express
Newspapers, the test laid down was that there must be a direct or inevitable
consequences of the measure enacted in the impugned Act and that 640 it would
not be Possible to strike down the legislation as having that effect and
operation. [751 B-C] Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. and another v. The Union of
India & Ors. [1959] 1 SCR 135 referred to.

In Hamdard Dawakhana's case it was held that it is not the form or incidental
infringement that determines the constitutionality of a statute but the
reality or the substance. [751 D] Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan v. Union
of India [1960] 2 SCR 671 at page 691 and Kochunni v. The State of Madras
[1960] 3 SCR 887 referred to. Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. and Ors. v. The Union of
India [1962] 3 SCR 842 distinguished. In Sakal Paper's Case the Court held
that the order was void as it violated Article 19(1)(a) and was not saved by
Article 19(2). In that case the impact of legislation under Article 21 on the
rights guaranteed under Article 19(1) was not in issue. [752 C-D] Kharak Singh
[1964] 1 SCR 332 relied on. Bank Nationalisation [1970] 3 SCR 530 and Bennet
Coleman [1973] 2 SCR 757 distinguished.

In Bank Nationalisation case the Court was only considering the decisions that
took the view that Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) were mutually exclusive. The
basis for the conclusion in Bank Nationalisation case is that Articles 19 and
31 are parts of a single pattern and while Article 19(1)(f) enjoins the right
to acquire, hold and dispose of property, clause 5 of Article 19 authorises
imposition of restrictions upon the right. There must be a reasonable
restriction and Article 31 assures the right to property and grants protection
against the exercise of the authority of the State and clause 5 of Article 19
and clauses 1 and 2 of Article 31 prescribe restrictions upon the said action,
subject to which the right to property may be exercised. The case specifically
over-ruled the view taken in Gopalan's case that the approach and form of the
State action alone need to be considered and the fact of loss of fundamental
rights of the individual in general will be ignored. The entire discussion in
Bank Nationalisation case related to the inter-relation between Article 3 1
(2) and Article 19 (1)

(f) Certain passing observations have been made about the liberty of persons.
However, there is no justification for holding that the case is an authority
for the proposition that the legislation under Article 21 should also satisfy
all the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1). Article 21 is
related to deprivation of life and personal liberty and it has been held that
it is not one of the rights enumerated in Article 19(1). That the decision in
Bank Nationalisation case so far as it relates to Articles 19(1) and 21 is In
the nature of obiter dicta. The Court had not applied its mind and, decided
the specific question. The observations were general and casual observations
on; a point not calling for decision and not obviously argued before it cannot
be taken as an authority on the proposition in question. The Court cannot be
said to have declared the law on the subject when no occasion arose for it to,
consider and decide the question. The judgment proceeded on some erroneous
assumptions. It was assumed by the judgment that the majority of the Court in
Gopalan's case held that Article 22 being a complete code relating to
preventive detention the validity of an order of detention must be determined
directly according to the terms within the four corners of that Article. The
said statement is not borne out from the record of the judgment in Gopalan's
case. If the obiter dicta based on the wrong assumption is to be taken as the
correct position in law it would lead to strange results. if Articles.

641

19(1) (a) to (e) and (g) are attracted in the case of deprivation of personal
liberty under Article 21, a punitive detention for an offence committed under
I.P.C., such as theft, cheating or assault would be illegal, for the
reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order would not cover the
said offences. There can be no distinction between the punitive detention and
preventive detention. Observation in Bank Nationalisation case that a
legislation under Article 21 should also satisfy the requirements of Article
19 cannot be taken as correct law. [754 G-H, 756 D-E, 757 C-E, G-H, 758 A-B,
C, 759 A, E-F] Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri [1950] SCR 869, The State of West
Bengal V. Subodh Gopal [1954] SCR 587, State of Bombay v. Bhanji Munji [1953]

Kochunni [1968] 3 SCR 887 referred to.

In S. N. Sarkar's case also, the majority held that Article 22 was a self-
contained Code. The view taken in this case also suffers from the same
infirmities referred to in the Bank Nationalisation case. In Khudi Ram's case
also this Court erroneously stated that Gopalan's case has taken the view that
Article 22 was a complete code. [759 F-H, 760 A-B] In Additional District
Magistrate, Jabalpur, Chief Justice Ray held that Article 21 is the 'rule of
law regarding life and liberty and no other rule of law can have separate
existence as a distinct right. Justice Beg observed that Gopalan's case was
merely cited in Cooper's case for illustrating a line of reasoning which was
held to be incorrect in determining validity of law. The question under
consideration was whether Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) were mutually exclusive.
The learned Judge did not understand the Cooper's case as holding that effect
of deprivation of rights outside Article 21 will also have to be considered.
[760D-F-H] In Bennet Coleman's case, the Court held that though Article 19(1)
does not mention the freedom of press it is settled view of the court that
freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of press and circulation. In
that case also the question whether Articles 21 and 19 are mutually exclusive
did not arise for consideration. Bennet Coleman's case. Express Newspapers
Case, and Sakai Newspapers case were all concerned with the right to freedom
of the press which is held to form part of the freedom of speech and
expression. [761 G-H] Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of New South Wales
[1950] A.C. 235 referred to.

The Passport Act provides for issue of passports and travel documents for
regulating the departure from India of citizens of India and other person.
Since the said Act complies with the requirements of Article 21 i.e.
compliance with procedure established by law, its validity cannot be
challenged. If incidentally the Act infringes on the rights of a citizen under
Article 19(1) of the Act, it cannot be found to be invalid. The pith and
substance rule will have to be applied and unless the rights are directly
affected, the challenge will fail. [763 A-B] The procedure established by law
does not mean procedure, however, fantastic and oppressive or arbitrary which
in truth and reality is no procedure at all. Section 5 of the Act provides for
applying for passports or travel documents etc. and the procedure for passing
orders thereon. The authority can either grant passport or can refuse it. In
case the authority refuses to grant it; it is required to record in writing a
brief statement of his reasons which are to be furnished to the person
concerned unless the authority for reasons specified in sub-section (3)
refuses to furnish a copy. Section 6 provides that the refusal to give an
endorsement shall be on one or other grounds mentioned in sub-sections (2) to
(6). Section 10 enables the Passport authority to vary or cancel the
endorsement on a passport. Section 10(3) 642 provides the reasons for which a
passport may be impounded. Again reason', are required to be furnished to the
person concerned on demand except if the, Passport Authority is of the opinion
that it will not be in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India,
security of India, 'friendly relations of India with any. foreign country or
in the interest of the general public to furnish such a copy. Section 11
provides for an appeal except when the order is passed by the Central
Government. [764 C-E, 765 A-G] The Legislature by making an express provision
may deny a person the right to be heard. Rules of natural justice cannot be
equated with the fundamental rights. Their aim is to secure justice and to
prevent miscarriage of justice. They do not supplant the law but supplement
it. If a statutory provision can be read consistently with the principles of
natural justice the court should do so but if a statutory provision that
specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of any rules
of natural justice this Court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or
the statutory authority and read into the concerned provision the principles
of natural justice. To a limited extent it may be necessary to revoke or to
impound a passport without notice if there is real apprehension that the
holder of the passport may leave the country if he becomes aware of any
intention on the part of the Passport Authority or the Government to revoke or
impound the passport but that itself would not justify denial of an
opportunity to the holder of the passport to, state his case before the final
order is passed. The legislature has not by express provision excluded the
right to be heard. [768 F- H, 769 A-B] Purtabpur v. Cane Commissioner, Bihar
[1969] 2 SCR 807 and Schmidt v. Secretary of State, Home Affairs [1969] 2 Ch.
149 referred to.

A passport may be impounded without notice but before any final order is
passed, the rule of audi alteram partem, would apply and the holder of the
passport will have to be heard. The petitioner has a right to be heard before
a final order under section 10(3)(e) is passed. Earlier, the courts had taken
a view that the principle of natural justice is inapplicable to administrative
orders. However, subsequently, there is a change in the judicial opinion. The
frontier between judicial and quasi-judicial determination on the one hand and
an executive or administrative determination on the other has become blurred.
The rigid view that principles of natural justice apply only to judicial and
quasi-judicial acts and not to administrative acts no longer holds the field.
The court is not intended to sit in appeal over the decision of the
Government. The decision of the Government under section 10(3)(c) is subject
to a limited judicial scrutiny. [770 A- F, H, 771 A, 772 B-D] H. K. (An
infant) [1967] 2 Q.B. 617 at p. 630 Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board
[1966] Supp. SCR 311, Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. S. D. Agarwal, [1969] 3 SCR
103 and U.P. Electric Co. v. State of U.P. [1969] 3 SCR 865 followed.

The provision empowering the Government not to disclose the reasons for
impounding etc. is valid. The Government is bound to give opportunity to the
bolder of the passport before finally revoking it or impounding it. The 643
cases in which the authority declines to furnish reasons for making an order
would be extremely rare. In case where the Government itself passes an order
it should be presumed that it would have made the order after careful
scrutiny. If an order is passed by the Passport Authority an appeal is pro-
vided. In the present case, there is no reason in declining to furnish to the
petitioner statement of reasons for impounding the passport. [772 H, 773 A-D,
H, 774 A] In view of the statement of the Attorney General that the petitioner
might make a representation in respect of the impounding of passport and that
the representations would be dealt with expeditiously and that even if the
imounding of the passport is confirmed it will not exceed a period of 6
months, it is not necessary to go into the merits of the case any further.
[776 B-C] & ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition No. 231 of 1977. (Under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India). Madan Bhatia and D. Goburdhan for
the Petitioner. S.V. Gupte, Attorney General, Soli J. Sorabjee, Additional
Sol. Genl. of India, R. N. Sachthey and K. N. Bhatt for the Respondents.

Rain Panjwani, Vijay Panjwani, Raj Panjwani, S. K. Bagga & Mrs. S. Bagga for
the Intervener.

The following Judgments were delivered BEG, C.J. The case before us involves
questions relating to basic human rights. On such questions I believe that
multiplicity of views giving the approach of each member of this Court is not
a disadvantage if it clarifies our not infrequently differing approaches. It
should enable all interested to appreciate better the significance of our Con-
stitution.

As I am in general agreement with my learned brethren Bhagwati and Krishna
lyer. I will endeavour to confine my observations to an indication of my own
approach on some matters for consideration now before us. This seems to me to
be particularly necessary as my learned brother Kailasam, who has also given
Us the benefit of his separate opinion, has a somewhat different approach. I
have had the advantage of going through the opinions of each of my three
learned brethren.

It seems to me that there can be little doubt that the right to travel and to
go outside the country, which orders regulating issue, suspension or
impounding, and cancellation of passports directly affect, must be included in
rights to "personal liberty" on the strength of decisions of this Court giving
a very wide ambit to the right to personal liberty (see : Satwant Singh
Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, Government of India,
New Delhi & Ors.,(1) Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors. (2). (1) [1967]

Article 21 of the Constitution reads as follows:

> "Protection of life and personal liberty. No person shall be deprived of his
> life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law".

It, is evident that Article 21, though so framed as to appear as a shield
operating negatively against executive encroachment over something covered by
that shield, is the legal recognition of both the protection or the shield as
well as of what it protects which lies beneath that shield. It has been so
interpreted as long ago as in A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,(1) where, as
pointed out by me in Addi- tional District Magistrate, Jabalpur v. S . S.
Shukla and others(2) with the help of quotations from judgments of Patanjli
Sastri, J. (from p. 195 to 196), Mahajan J. (p. 229-230), Das J. (295 and
306-307). I may add to the passages cited there some from the judgment of
Kania Chief Justice who also, while distinguishing the objects and natures of
articles 21 and 19, gave a wide enough scope to Art. 21.

Kania CJ said (at p. 106-107) "Deprivation (total loss) of personal liberty,
which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work
or not to work as and when one-pleases and several such rights sought to be
protected by the expression 'personal liberty' in article 21, is quite
different from restriction (which is only a partial control) of the right to
move freely (which is relatively a minor right of a citizen) as safeguarded by
article 19(1)

(d). Deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction
of free movement in the territory of India. This is made clear when the
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter VIII relating to security
of peace or maintenance of public order are read. Therefore article 19 (5)
cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty. I
am unable to accept the contention that the word 'deprivation' includes within
its scope 'restriction' when interpreting article 21. Article 22 envisages the
law of preventive detention. So does article 246 read with Schedule Seven,
List I, Entry 9, and lList III, Entry 3. Therefore, when the subject of
preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the Chapter on Fundamental
Rights I do not think it is proper to consider a legislation permitting
preventive detention as in confli ct with the rights mentioned in article
19(1). Article 19(1) does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of
personal liberty. In (1) [1950] SCR 88.

that article only certain phases of liberty are dealt with. 'Personal liberty'
would primarily mean liberty of the physical body. The rights given under
article 19(1) do not directly come under that description. They are rights
which accompany the freedom or liberty of the person. By their very nature
they are freedoms of a person assumed to be in full possession of his personal
liberty. If article 19 is considered to be the only article safeguarding
personal liberty several well-recognised_ rights, as for instance, the right
to eat or drink, the right to work, play, swim and numerous other rights and
activities and even the right to life will not be deemed protected under the
Constitution. I do not think that is the intention. It seems to me improper to
read article 19 as dealing with the same subject as article 21. Article 19
gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of India while article
21 is applicable to all persons. The word citizen is expressly defined in the
Constitution to indicate only a certain section of the inhabitants of India.
Moreover, the protection given by- article 21 is very general. It is of 'law'
--whatever that expression is interpreted to mean. The legis- lative
restrictions on the law-making powers of the legislature are not here
prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article 19. In
my opinion therefore article 19 should be read as a separate complete
article".

In that case, Mukherjea J., after conceding that the rights given by article
19(1) (d) would be incidentally contravened by an order of preventive
detention (see p. 261) and expressing the opinion that a wider significance
was given by Blackstone to the term " personal liberty", which may include the
right to locomotion, as Mr. Nambiar, learned Counsel for A. K. Gopalan, wanted
the Court to infer, gave a narrower connotation to "personal liberty", as
"freedom from physical constraint or coercion" only. Mukherjea, J., cited
Dicey for his more restrictive view that "personal liberty" would mean : "a
personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest or other physical
coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification". He then
said "It is, in my opinion, this negative right of not being subjected to any
form of physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the essence of
personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part of the Indian
territory".

After referring to the views of the Drafting Committee of our Constitution
Mukherjea, J., said : (p. 963) :

> "It is enough to say at this stage that if the report of the Drafting
> Committee is an appropriate material upon which the interpretation of the
> words of the Constitution- could be based, it certainly goes against the
> contention of the applicant and it shows that the words used in article
> 19(1) (d) of the Constitution do not mean the same thing as the expression
> 3-119SCI/78  646 personal liberty' in article 21 does. It is well known that

> the Supreme Court of the- United States of America. It includes not only
> personal freedom from physical restraint but the right to the free use of

> Fazal Ali, J., however, said (at p. 148) "To my mind, the scheme of the

As has been pointed out by my learned brother Bhagwati, by detailed references
to cases, such as Haradhan Saha v. The State of West Bengal & Ors(1) and
Shambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (2) , the view that Articles 19
and 21 constitute water tight compartments, so that all aspects of personal
liberty could be excluded from Article 19 of the Constitution, had to be
abandoned as a result of what was held, by a larger bench of this Court in R.
C. Cooper v. Union of India(3), to be the sounder view. Therefore, we could
,neither revive that overruled doctrine nor could we now hold that impounding
or cancellation of a passport does not impinge upon and affect fundamental
rights guaranteed, by the Constitution. I may point out that the doctrine that
Articles 19 and 21 protect or regulate flows in different channels, which
certainly appears to have found favour in this Court in A. K. Gopalan's case
(supra), was laid down in a context which was very different from that in
which that approach was displaced by the sounder view that the Constitution
must be read as an integral whole, with possible over-lappings of the subject
matter of what is sought to be protected by its various provisions par-
ticularly by articles relating to fundamental rights. (1) [1975] 1 SCR778.

In A. K. Gopalan's case (supra), what was at issue was whether the tests was
valid procedure for deprivation of personal liberty by preventive detention
must be found exclusively in Article 22 of the Constitutions or could we
gather from outs de it also elements of any "due process of law" and use them
to test the validity of a law dealing with preventive detention. Our
Constitution-makers, while accepting a departure, from ordinary norms. by
permitting making of laws for preventive detention without trial for special
reasons in exceptional situations also provided quite elaborately, in Article
22 of the Constitution itself,' whit requirements such law, relating to
preventive detention, must satisfy. The procedural requirements of such laws
separately formed parts of the guaranteed fundamental rights. Therefore, when
this Court was called upon to judge the validity of provisions relating to
preventive detention it laid down, in Gopalan's case (supra), that the tests
of "due process", with regard to such laws, are to be found in Article 22 of
the Constitution, exclusively because this article constitutes a self-
contained code for laws of this description. That was, in my view, the real
ratio decidendi of Gopalan's case (supra). It appears to me, with great
respect, that other observations relating to the separability of the subject
matters of Articles 21 and 19 were mere obiter dicta. They may have appeared
to the majority of learned Judges in Gopalan's case to be extensions of the
logic they adopted with regard to the relationship between Article 21 and 22
of the Constitution. But, the real issue there was whether, in the face of
Article 22 of theConstitution, which provides all the tests of procedural
validity of alaw regulating preventive detention other tests could be im-
ported from Article 19 of the Constitution or elsewhere into "procedure
established by law". The majority view was that this could not be done. I
think, if I may venture to conjecture what opinions learned Judges of this
Court would have expressed on that occasion had other types of law or other
aspects of personal liberty, such as those which confronted this Court in
either Satwant Singh's case (supra) or Kharak Singh's case (supra) were before
them, the same approach or the same language would not have been adopted by
them. It seems to me that this aspect of Gopalan's case (supra) is important
to remember if we are to correctly understand what was laid down in that case.
I have already referred to the passages I cited in A. D. M. Jabaipur's case
(supra) to show that, even in Gopalan's case (supra), the majority of judges
of this Court took the view that (the ambit of personal liberty protected by
Article 21 is wide and comprehensive. It embraces both substantive rights to
personal liberty and the procedure provided for their deprivation. One can,
however, say that no question of "due process-of law" can really arise apart
from procedural requirements of preventive detention laid down by Article 22,
in a case such as the one this Court considered in Gopalan's case (supra). The
clear meaning of Article 22 is that the requirements of "due process of law",
in cases of preventive detention, are satisfied by what is, provided by
Article 22 of the Constitution itself. This article in- dicates the pattern of
"the procedure established by law" for cases of preventive detention.

648

Questions, however, relating to either deprivation or restrictions of personal
liberty, concerning laws falling outside Article 22 remained really
unanswered, strictly speaking, by Gopalan's case. If one may so put it, the
field of "due process" for cases of preventive detention is fully covered by
Article 22, but other parts of that field, not covered by Article 22, are
"unoccupied" by its specific provisions. I have no doubt that, in what may be
called "unoccupied" portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty, the
substantive as well as procedural laws made to cover them must satisfy the
requirements of both Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.

Articles dealing with different fundamental rights contained in Part III of
the Constitution do not represent entirely separate streams of rights which do
not mingle at many points. They are all parts of an integrated scheme in the
Constitution. Their waters must mix to constitute that grand flow of unimpeded
and impartial Justice (social,economic and political), Freedom (not only of
thought, expression,belief, faith and worship, but also of association,
movement, vacationor occupation as well as of acquisition and possession of
reasonable property), of Equality (of status and of opportunity, which imply
absence of unreasonable or unfair discrimination between individuals, groups
and classes), and of Fraternity (assuring dignity of the individual and the
unity of the nation), which our Con- stitution visualises. Isolation of
various aspects of human freedom, for purposes of their protection, is neither
realistic nor beneficial but would defeat the very objects of such protection.

We have to remember that the fundamental rights protected by Part III of the
Constitution, out of which Articles 14, 19 and 21 are the most frequently
invoked, form tests of the validity of executive as well as legislative
actions when these actions are subjected to judicial scrutiny. We cannot
disable Article 14 or 19 from so functioning and hold those executive and
legislative actions to which they could apply as unquestionable even when
there is no emergency to shield actions of doubtful legality. These tests are,
in my opinion, available to us now to determine the constitutional validity of
Section 10 (3) (c) of the Act as well as of the impugned order of 7th July,
1977, passed against the petitioner impounding her passport "in the interest
of general public" and stating that the Government bad decided not to furnish
her with a copy of reasons and claiming immunity from such disclosure under
section 10(5) of the Act.

I have already mentioned some of the authorities relied upon by me in A. D. M.
Jabalpur v. S. Shukla (Supra), while discussing the scope of Article 21 of the
Constitution, to hold that its ambit is very wide. I will now indicate why, in
my view, the particular rights claimed by the petitioner could fall within
Articles 19 and 21. and the nature and origin of such rights.

Mukerji J., in Gopalan's case (supra) referred to the celebrated commentaries
of Blackstone on the Laws of England. It is instructive to reproduce passages
from there even though juristic reasoning may have travelled today beyond the
stage reached by it when Blackstone 649 wrote. Our basic concepts on such
matters, stated there, have provided the foundations on which subsequent
superstructures were raised. Some of these foundations, fortunately, remain
intact. Blackstone said :

> "This law of nature, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself,
> is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the
> globe in all coun- tries, and at all times : no human laws are of any
> validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all
> their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this
> original."

The identification of natural law with Divine will or dictates of God may
have, quite understandably, vanished at a time when men see God, if they see
one anywhere at all, in the highest qualities inherent in the nature of Man
himself. But the idea of a natural law as a morally inescapable postulate of a
just order, recognizing the inalienable and inherent rights of all men (which
term includes women) as equals before the law persists. It is, I think,
embedded in our own Constitution. I do not think that we can reject
Blackstone's theory of natural rights as totally irrelevant for us today.

Blackstone propounded his philosophy of natural or absolute rights in the
following terms :

> "The absolute rights of man, considered as a free agent, endowed with
> discernment to know good from evil, and with power of choosing those
> measures which appear to him to be most desirable, are usually summed up in
> one general appellation, and denominated the natural liberty of mankind.
> This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks
> fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law of nature; being a
> right inherent in us by birth,and one of the gifts of God to man at his
> creation, when he endued him with the faculty of free will. But everyman,
> when he enters into society, gives up a part of his natural liberty, as the
> price of so valuable a purchase, and, in consideration of receiving the
> advantages of mutual commerce, obliges himself to conform to those laws,
> which the community has thought proper to establish. And this species of
> legal obedience and conformity is infinitely more desirable than that will
> and savage liberty which is sacrificed to obtain it. For no man that
> considers a moment would wish to retain the absolute and uncontrolled power
> of doing whatever he pleases; the consequence of which is, that every other
> man would also have the same power, and then there would be no security to
> individuals in any of the enjoyments of life. Political, therefore, or civil
> liberty, which is that of a member of society, is no other than natural
> liberty so far restrained by human laws (and no farther) as is necessary and
> expedient for the general advantage of the public.

650

> The absolute rights of every Englishman, (which, taken in a political and
> extensive sense, are usually called their liberties), as they are founded on
> nature and reason, so they are coeval with our form of Government; though
> subject at times to fluctuate and change; their establishment (excellent as
> it is) being still human.

> * * * And these may be reduced to three principal or primary articles; the
> right of personal security, the right of personal liberty, and the right of
> private property, because, as there is no other known method of compulsion,

> of one or other of these important rights, the preservation of these,
> involate, may justly be said to include the preservation of our civil
> immunities in their largest and most extensive sense.

> I.The right of personal security consists in a person's legal and
> uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health and his
> reputation.

> II.Next to personal security, the law of England regards, asserts, and
> preserves the personal liberty of individuals. This personal liberty
> consists in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or moving one's
> person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct, without
> imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law. Concerning which we
> may make the same observations as upon the preceding article, that it is a
> right strictly natural; that the laws of England have never abridged it
> without sufficient cause; and that, in this kingdom, it cannot ever be
> abridged at the mere discretion of the magistrate, without the explicit
> permission of the laws. III. The third absolute right, inherent in every

> owner, and of translating it from man to man, are entirely derived from
> society; and are some of those civil advantages, in exchange for which every
> individual has resigned a part of his natural liberty."

I have reproduced from Blackstone whose ideas may appear somewhat quaint in an
age of irreverence because, although, I know that modern jurisprudence
conceives of all rights as relative or as products of particular socioeconomic
orders, yet, the idea that man, as man, morally has certain inherent natural
primordial inalienable human rights goes back to the very origins of human
jurisprudence.

651

It is found in Greek philosophy. If we have advanced today towards what we
believe to be a higher civilisation and a more enlightened era, we cannot fall
behind what, at any rate, was the meaning given to "personal liberty" long ago
by Blackstone. As indicated above, it included "the power of locomotion, of
changing situation, or moving one's person to whatsoever place one's own
inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due
course of law". I think that both the rights of "personal security" and of cc
personal liberty", recognised by what Blackstone termed "natural law", are
embodied in Article 21 of the Constitution. For this proposition, I relied, in
A. D. M. Jabalpur v. S. S. Shukla (supra), and I do so again here, on a
passage from Subba Rao C.J., speaking for five Judges of this Court in I. C.
Golaknath v. State of Punjab(1) when he said (at p. 789) :

> "Now, what are the fundamental rights ? They are embodied in Part III of the
> Constitution and they may be classified thus: (i) right to equality, (ii)
> right to freedom, (iii) right against exploitation, (iv) right to freedom of
> religion, (v) cultural and educational rights , (vi) right to property, and
> (vii) right to constitutional remedies. They are the rights of the people
> preserved by our Constitution, 'Fundamental rights' are the modem name for
> what have been traditionally known as 'natural rights'. As one author puts
> it : 'they are moral rights which every human being everywhere at all times
> ought to have simply because of the fact that in contradistinction with
> other beings, he, is rational and moral'. They are the primordial rights
> necessary for the development of human personality. They are the rights
> which enable a man to chalk out his own life in the manner he likes best.
> Our Constitution, in addition to the Well-known fundamental rights, also
> included the rights of the minorities, untouchables and other backward
> communities, in such right". Hidayatullah, J., in the same case said (at p.

> 877) "What I have said does not mean that Fundamental Rights are not subject
> to change or modification. In the most inalienable of such rights a
> distinction must be made between possession of a right and its exercise. The
> first is fixed and the latter controlled by justice and necessity. Take for
> example Article 21 :

> 'No person shall be deprived of his life or personalliberty except according

> Of all the rights, the right to one's life is the most valuable. This
> article of the Constitution,therefore, makes the right fundamental. But the
> inalienable right is curtailed by a murderer's conduct as viewed under law.
> The deprivation, when it takes place, is not of the right which was
> immutable but of the continued exercised of right.,' (1) [1967] 2 SCR762.

652

It is, therefore, clear that six out of eleven Judges in Golak Nath's case
declared that fundamental rights are natural rights embodied in the
Constitution itself. This view was affirmed by the majority Judges of this
Court in Shukla's case. It was explained by me there at some length. Khanna,,
J., took a somewhat different view. Detailed reasons were given by me in
Shukla's case (supra) for taking what I found to be and still find as the only
view I could possibly take if I were not to disregard, as I could not properly
do, what had been held by larger benches and what I myself consider to be the
correct view : that natural law rights were, meant to be converted into our
Constitutionally recognised fundamental rights, atleast so far as they are
expressly mentioned, so that they are to be found within it and not outside
it. To take a contrary view would involve a conflict between natural law and
our Constitutional law. I am emphatically of opinion that a divorce between
natural law and our Constitutional law will be disastrous. It will defeat one
of the basic purposes of our Constitution. The implication of what I have
indicated above is that Article 21 is also a recognition and declaration of
rights which inhere in every individual. Their existence does not depend on
the location of the individual. Indeed, it could be argued that what so
inheres is inalienable and cannot be taken away at all. This may seem
theoretically correct and logical. But, in fact, we are often met with denials
of what is, in theory, inalienable or "irrefragible". Hence, we speak of
"deprivations" or "restrictions" which are really impediments to the exercise
of the "inalienable" rights' Such deprivations or restrictions or regulations
of rights may take place, within prescribed limits, by means of either
statutory law or purported actions under that law. The degree to which the
theoretically recognised or abstract right is concretised is thus determined
by the balancing of principles on which an inherent right is based against
those on which a restrictive law or orders under it could be imposed upon its
exercise. We have to decide in each specific case, as it arises before us,
what the result of such a balancing is.

In judging the validity of either legislative or executive state action for
conflict with any of the fundamental rights of individuals, whether they be of
citizens or non-citizens, the question as to where the rights are to be
exercised is not always material or even relevant. If the persons concerned,
on whom the law or purported action under it is to operate, are outside the
territorial jurisdiction of our country, the action taken may be ineffective.
But, the validity of the law must be determined on considerations other than
this. The tests of validity of restrictions imposed upon the rights covered by
article 19(1) will be found in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19. There is
nothing ther e to suggest that restrictions on right', the exercise of which
may involve going out of the country or some activities abroad are excluded
from the purview of tests contemplated by articles 19(2) to (6). 1 agree with
my learned brother Bhagwati, for reasons detailed by him, that the total
effect and not the mere form of a restriction will determine which fundamental
right is really involved in a 653 particular case and whether a restriction
upon its exercise is reasonbly permissible on the facts and circumstances of
that case.

If rights under article 19 are rights which inhere in Indian citizens,
individuals concerned carry these inherent fundamental constitutional rights
with them wherever they go, in so far as our law applies to them, because they
are, parts of the Indian nation just as Indian ships, flying the Indian flag,
are deemed, in International law, to be floating parts of Indian territory.
This analogy, however, could not be pushed too far because Indian citizens on
foreign territory, are only entitled, by virtue of their Indian nationality
and passports, to the protection of the Indian Republic and the assistance of
its diplomatic missions abroad. They cannot claim to be governed abroad by
their own Constitutional or personal laws which do not operate outside India.
But, that is not the position in the case before us. So far as the impugned
action in the case before us is concerned, it took place in India and against
an Indian citizen residing in India.

In India, at any rate, we are all certainly governed by our Constitution. The
fact that the affected petitioner may not, as a result of a particular order,
be able to do something intended to be done by her abroad cannot possibly make
the Governmental action in India either ineffective or immune from judicial
scrutiny or from an attack made on the ground of a violation of a fundamental
right which inheres in an Indian citizen. The consequences or effects upon the
petitioner's possible actions or future activities in other countries may be a
factor which may be weighed, where relevant, with other relevant facts in a
particular case in judging the merits of the restriction imposed. It will be
relevant in so far as it can be shown to have some connection with public or
national interests when determining the merits of an order passed. It may show
how she has become a " person aggrieved" with a cause of action, by a
particular order involving her personal freedom. But, such considerations
cannot curtail or impair the scope or operation of fundamental rights of
citizens as protections against unjustifiable actions of their own Government.
Nor can they, by their own force, protect legally unjustifiable actions of the
Government of our country against attacks in our own Courts.

In order to apply the tests contained in Articles 14 and 19 of the
Constitution, we have to consider the objects for which the exercise of
inherent rights recognised by Article '21 of the Constitution are restricted
as well as the procedure by which these restrictions are sought to be imposed.
Both substantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them will have to
pass tests imposed by articles 14 and 19 whenever facts justifying the
invocation of either of these articles may be disclosed. For example, an
international singer or dancer may well be able to complain of an
unjustifiable restriction on professional activity by a denial of a passport.
In such a case, violations of both articles 21 and 19(1) (g) may both be put
forward making it necessary for the authorities concerned to justify the
restriction imposed by showing satisfaction of tests of validity contemplated
by each of these two articles.

654

The tests of reason and justice cannot be abstract. They cannot be divorced
from the needs of the nation. The tests have to be pragmatic. Otherwise, they
would cease to be reasonable. Thus, I think that a discretion left to the
authority to impound a passport in public interest cannot invalidate the law
itself. We cannot, out of fear that such power will be misused,-refuse to
permit Parliament to entrust even such power to executive authorities as may
be absolutely necessary to carry out the purposes of a validly exercisable
power. I think it has to be necessarily left to executive discretion to decide
whether, on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, public interest
will or will not be served by a particular order to be passed under a valid
law subject, as it always is, to judicial supervision. In matters such as
grant, suspension, impounding or cancellation of passports, the possible
dealings of an individual with nationals and authorities of other States have
to be considered. The contemplated or possible activities abroad of the
individual may have to be taken into. account. There may be questions of
national safety and welfare which transcend the importance of the individual's
inherent right to go where he or she pleases to go. Therefore, although we may
not deny the grant of wide discretionary power, to the executive authorities
as un- reasonable in such cases, yet, I think we must look for and find
procedural safeguards to ensure that the power will not be used for purposes
extraneous to the grant of the power before we uphold the validity of the
power conferred. We have to insist on procedural proprieties the observance of
which could show that such a power is being used only to serve what can
reasonably and justly be, regarded as a public or national interest capable of
overriding the individual's inherent right of movement or travel to wherever
he or she pleases in the modern world of closer integration in every sphere
between the peoples of the world and the shrunk time-space relationship.

The view I have taken above proceeds on the assumption that there are inherent
or natural human rights of the individual recognised by and embodied in our
Constitution. Their actual exercise, however, is regulated and conditioned
largely by statutory law. Persons upon whom these basic rights are conferred
can exercise them so long as there is no justifiable reason under the law
enabling deprivations or restrictions of such rights. But, once the valid
reason is found to be there and the deprivation or restriction takes place for
that valid reason in a procedurally valid manner, the action which results in
a deprivation or restriction becomes unassailable. If either the reason
sanctioned by the law is absent, or the procedure followed in arriving at the
conclusion that such a reason exists is unreasonable, the order having the
effect of deprivation or restriction must be quashed.

A bare look at the provisions of S. IO, sub.s. (3 ) of the Act will show that
each of the orders which could be passed under section 10, sub.s. (3) (a) to
(h) requires a "satisfaction" by the Passport Authority on certain objective
conditions which must exist in a case before it passes an order to impound a
passport or a travel document. Impounding or revocation are placed side by
side on the same footing in the provision. Section 11 of the Act provides an
appeal to the Central Government 655 from every order passed under section 10,
sub.s. (3) of the Act. Hence, section 10, subs. s. (5) makes it obligatory
upon the Passport Authority to "record in writing a brief statement of the
reasons for making such order and furnish to the holder of the passport or
travel document on, demand a copy of the same unless in any case, the passport
authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interests of the
sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations
of India with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public to
furnish such a copy".

It seems to me, from the provisions of section 5, 7 and 8 of the Act, read
with other provisions, that there is a statutory right also acquired, on
fulfilment of prescribed conditions by the holder of a passport, that it
should continue to be effective for the specified period so long as no ground
has come into existence for either its revocation or for impounding it which
amounts to a suspension of it for the time being. It is true that in a
proceeding under article 32 of the Constitution, we are only concerned with
the enforcement of fundamental Constitutional rights and not with any
statutory rights apart from fundamental rights. Article 2 1, however, makes it
clear That violation of a law, whether statutory or if any other kind, is
itself an infringement of the guaranteed fundamental right. The basic right is
not to be denied the protection of "law" irrespective of variety of that law.
It need only be a right "established by law".

There can be no doubt whatsoever that the orders under section 10(3) must be
based upon some material even if that material consists, in some cases, of
reasonable suspicion arising from certain credible assertions made by reliable
individuals. It may be that, in an emergent situation, the impounding of a
passport may become necessary without even giving an opportunity to be heard
against such a step, which could be reversed after an opportunity given to the
holder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary, but, ordinarily,
no passport could be reasonably either impounded or revoked without giving a
prior opportunity to its holder to show cause against the proposed action. The
impounding as well revocation of a passport, seem to constitute action in the
nature of a punishment necessitated on one of the grounds specified in the
Act. Hence, ordinarily, an opportunity to be heard in defence after a show
cause notice should be given to the holder of a, passport even before
impounding it.

It is well established that even where there is no specific provision in a
statute or rules made thereunder for showing cause against action proposed to
be taken against an individual, which affects the rights of that individual,
the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be implied from the
nature of the function to be performed by the authority which has the power to
take punitive or damaging action. This principle was laid down by this Court
in the State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei & Ors.(1) in the following
words "The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be
passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to (1) AIR 1967 S.C. 1269 at
1271.

judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate
upon matters involving civil consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules
of our constitutional set-up that every citizen is protected against exercise
of arbitrary authority by the State or its officers. Duty to act judicially
would, therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be
performed, it need not be shown to be super- ,added. If there is power to
decide and determine to the prejudice of a person, duty to act judicially is
implicit in the exercise of such power. If the essentials of justice be
ignored and an order to the prejudice of a Person is made, the order is a
nullity. That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof
transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case."

In England, the rule was thus expressed by Byles J. in Cooper v. Wandsworth
Board of Works(1) "The laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity
to make his defence, if he has any. I remember to have heard it observed by a
very learned man, upon such an occasion, that even God himself did not pass
sentence upon Adam before be was called upon to make his defence. "Adam (says
God), "where art thou ? Hast thou ? not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
thee that thou shouldest not eat And the same question was put to Eve also."

I find no difficulty whatsoever in holding, on the strength of these well
recognised principles, that an order impounding a passport must be made quasi-
judicially. This was not done in the case before us.

In my estimation, the findings arrived at by my learned brethren after an
examination of the facts of the case before us, with which I concur, indicate
that it cannot be said that a good enough reason has been shown to exist for
impounding the passport of the petitioner by the order dated 7th July, 1977.
Furthermore, the petitioner has bad no opportunity of showing that the ground
for impounding it finally given in this Court either does not exist or has no
bearing on public interest or that public interest cannot be better served in
some other manner. Therefore, speaking for myself, I would quash the order and
direct the opposite parties to give an opportunity to the petitioner to show-
cause against any proposed action on such grounds as may be available.

I am not satisfied that there were present any such pressing grounds with
regard to the petitioner before us that the immediate action of impounding her
passport was called for. Furthermore, the rather cavalier fashion in which
disclosure of any reason for impounding her passport was denied to her,
despite the fact that the only reason said to exist the possibility of her
being called to give evidence before a commission of inquiry and stated in the
counter-affidavit filed in this Court, is not such as to be reasonably deemed
to necessitate, its concealment in (1) 1863 (14) C.B. (N.S.) 180.

657

public interest, may indicate the existence of some undue prejudice against
the petitioner. She has to be protected against even the appearance of such
prejudice or bias. It appears to me that even executive authorities when
taking administrative action which involves any deprivations of or
restrictions on inherent fundamental rights of citizens must take care to see
that justice is not only done but manifestly appears to be done. They have a
duty to proceed in a way which is free from even the appearance of
arbitrariness or unreasonableness or unfairness. They have to act in a manner
which is patently impartial and meets the requirements of natural justice.

The attitude adopted by the Attorney General however, shows that Passport
authorities realize fully that the petitioner's case has not been justly or
reasonably dealt with. As the undertaking given by the Attorney General
amounts to an offer to deal with it justly and fairly after informing the
petitioner of any ground that may exist for impounding her passport, it seems
that no further action by this Court may be necessary. In view, however, of
what is practically an admission that the order actually passed on 7th July,
1977, is neither fair nor procedurally proper, I would, speaking for myself,
quash this order and direct the return of the impounded passport to the
petitioner. I also think that the petitioner is entitled to her costs.
CHANDRACHUD, J.-The petitioner's passport dated June 1, 1976 having been
impounded "in public interest" by an order dated July 2, 1977 and the
Government of India having declined "in the interest of general public" to
furnish to her the reasons. for its decision, she has filed this writ petition
under article 32 of the Constitution to challenge that order. The challenge is
founded on the following grounds :

> (1) To the extent to which section 10(3) (c) of the Passport Act, 1967
> authorises the passport authority to impound a passport "in the interests of
> the general public", it is violative of article 14 of the Constitution since
> it confers vague and undefined power on the passport authority;

> (2) Section 10 (3) (c) is void as conferring an arbitrary power since it
> does not provide for a hearing to the holder of the passport before the
> passport is, impounded; (3) Section 10(3)(c) is violative of article 21 of
> the Constitution since it does not prescribe 'procedure' within the meaning
> of that article and since the procedure which it prescribes is arbitrary and
> unreasonable; and (4) Section 10 (3)(c) offends against articles 19(1)(a)
> and 19 (1 ) (g) since it permits restrictions to be imposed on the rights
> guaranteed by these articles even though such restrictions cannot be imposed
> under articles 19(2) and 19(6).

658

At first, the passport authority exercising its power under section 10(5) of
the Act refused to furnish to the petitioner the reason for which it was
considered necessary in the interests of general public to impound her
passport. But those reasons were disclosed later in the counter- affidavit
filed on behalf of the Government of India in answer to the writ petition. The
disclosure made under the stress of the writ petition that the petitioner's
passport was impounded because, her presence was likely to be required in
connection with the proceedings before a Commission of Inquiry, could easily
have been made when the petitioner called upon the Government to let her know
the reasons why her passport was impounded. The power to refuse to disclose
the reasons for impounding a passport is of an exceptional nature and it ought
to be exercised fairly, sparingly and only when fully justified by the
exigencies of an uncommon situation. The reasons, if disclosed being open to
judicial scrutiny for ascertaining their nexus with the order impounding the
passport, the refusal to disclose the reasons would equally be open to the
scrutiny of the court; or else, the wholesome power of a dispassionate
judicial examination of executive orders could with impunity be set at naught
by an obdurate determination to suppress the reasons. Law cannot permit the
exercise of a power to keep the reasons undisclosed if the sole reason for
doing so is to keep the reasons away from judicial scrutiny. In Satwant Singh
Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, Government of India,
New Delhi & Ors.(1) this Court ruled by majority that the expression "personal
liberty" which occurs in article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to
travel abroad and that no person can be deprived of that right except
according to procedure established by law. The Passport Act which was enacted
by Parliament in 1967 in order to comply with that decision prescribes the
procedure whereby an application for a passport may be granted fully or
partially, with or without any endorsement, and a passport once granted may
later be revoked or impounded. But the mere prescription of some kind of
procedure cannot ever meet the mandate of article

21\. The procedure prescribed by law has to be fair, just and reasonable, not
fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary. The question whether the procedure
prescribed by a law which curtails or takes away the personal liberty
guaranteed by article 21 is reasonable or not has to be considered not in the
abstract or on hypothetical considerations like the provision for a full-
dressed hearing as in a Courtroom trial, but in the context, primarily, of the
purpose which the Act is intended to achieve and of urgent situations which
those who are charged with the duty of administering the Act may be called
upon to deal with. Secondly, even the fullest compliance with the requirements
of article 21 is not the journey's end because, a law which prescribes fair
and reasonable procedure for curtailing or taking away the personal liberty
guaranteed by article 21 has still to meet a possible challenge under other
Provisions of the Constitution like, for example, articles 14 and 19. If the
holding in A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras(2) that the freedoms guaranteed by
the Constitution are (1) [1967] 3 SCR 525 (2) [1950] SCR 88.

659

mutually exclusive were still good law, the right to travel abroad which is
part of the right of personal liberty under article 21 could only be found and
located in that article and in no other. But in the Bank Nationalisation Case
(R. C. Cooper v. Union of India) (1) the majority held that the assumption in
A. K. Gopalan(2) that certain articles of the Constitution exclusively deal
with specific matters cannot be accepted as correct. Though the Bank
Nationalisation case(1) was concerned with the inter-relationship of article
31 and 19 and not ,of articles 21 and 19, the basic approach adopted therein
as regards the construction of fundamental rights guaranteed in the different
pro-visions of the Constitution categorically discarded the major premise of
the majority judgment in A. K. Gopalan (supra) as incorrect. That is how a
seven-Judge Bench in Shambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of West Bengal & Ors.(3)
assessed the true impact of the ratio of the Bank Nationalisation Case (supra)
on the decision in A. K. Gopalan (supra) in Shambhu Nath Sarkar(3) it was
accordingly held that a law of preventive detention has to meet the challenge
not only of articles 21 and 22 but also of article 19 (1 ) (d). Later, a five-
Judge Bench in Haradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal & Ors.(4) adopted the
same approach and considered the question whether the Maintenance of Internal
Security Act, 1971 violated the right guaranteed by article 19(1) (d). Thus,
the inquiry whether the right to travel abroad forms a part of any of the
freedoms mentioned in article 19(1) is not to be shut out at the threshold
merely because that right is a part of the guarantee of personal liberty under
article 21. 1 am in entire agreement with Brother Bhagwati when he says :

> "The law must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that article 21
> does not exclude article 19 and that even if there is a law prescribing a
> procedure for depriving a person of 'personal liberty' and there is
> consequently no infringement of the fundamental right conferred by article
> 21, such law, in so far as it abridges or takes away any fundamental right
> under article 19 would have to meet the challenge of that article."

The interplay of diverse articles of the Constitution guaranteeing various
freedoms has gone through vicissitudes which have been elaborately traced by
Brother Bhagwati. The test of directness of the impugned law as contrasted
with its consequences was thought in A. K. Gopalan (supra) and Ram Singh(5) to
be the true approach for determining whether a fundamental right was
infringed. A significant application of that test may be perceived in Naresh
S. Mirajkar(6) where an order passed by the Bombay High Court prohibiting the
publication of a witness's evidence in a defamation case was upheld by this
Court on the ground that it was passed with the object of affording protection
to the witness in order to obtain true evidence (1) [1973] 3 SCR 530.

(2) [1950] SCR 88 (3) [1973] 1 SCR 856.

(4) [1975] 1 SCR 778.

(5) [1951] SCR 451.

(6) [1966] 3 SCR 744.

660

and its impact on the right of free speech and expression guaranteed by
article 19(1) (a) was incidental. N. H. Bhagwati J. in Express Newspapers(1)
struck a modified note by evolving the test of proximate effect and operation
of the statute. That test saw its fruition in Sakal Papers(2) where the Court,
giving precedence to the direct and immediate effect of the order over its
form and object, struck down the Daily Newspapers (Price and Page) Order, 1960
on the ground that it violated article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The
culmination of this thought process came in the Bank Nationalisation Case
(supra) where it was held by the majority, speaking through Shah J., that the
extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined
by the direct operation of an action upon the individual's rights and not by
the object of the legislature or by the form of the action. In Bennett
Coleman(3) the Court, by a majority, reiterated the same position by saying
that the direct operation of the Act upon the rights forms the real test. It
struck down the newsprint policy, restricting the number of pages of
newspapers without the option to reduce the circulation, as offending against
the provisions of article 19(1) (a). "The action may have a direct effect on a
fundamental right although its direct subject matter may be different"
observed the Court, citing an effective instance of a law dealing with the
Defence of India or with defamation and yet having a direct effect on the
freedom of speech and expression. The measure of directness, as held by
Brother Bhagwati, is the 'inevitable' consequence of the impugned statute.
These then are the guidelines with the help of which one has to ascertain
whether section 10(3) (c) of the Passport Act which authorizes the passport
authority to impound a passport or the impugned order passed thereunder
violates the guarantee of free speech and expression conferred by article
19(1) (a).

The learned Attorney General answered the petitioner's contention in this
behalf by saying firstly, that the right to go abroad cannot be comprehended
within the right of free speech and expression since the latter right is
exercisable by the Indian citizens within the geographical limits of India
only. Secondly, he contends, the right to go abroad is altogether of a
different genre from the right of free speech and expression and is therefore
not a part of it.

The first of these contentions raises a question of great importance but the
form in which the contention is couched is, in my opinion, apt to befog the
true issue. Article 19 confers certain freedoms oil Indian citizens, some of
which by their very language and nature are limited in their exercise by
geographical considerations. The right to move freely throughout the
'territory of India' and the right to reside and settle in any part of the
'territory of India' which are contained in clauses (d) and (e) of article
19(1) are of this nature. The two clauses expressly restrict the operation of
the rights mentioned therein to the territorial limits of India. Besides, by
the very object and nature of those rights, their exercise is limited to
Indian territory.

(1) [1959] SCR 12.

(2) [1962] 3 SCR 842.

(3) [1973] 2 SCR 757.

661

Those rights are intended to bring in sharp focus, the unity and integrity of
the country and its quasi-federal structure. Their drive is directed against
the fissiparous theory that 'sons of the soil' alone shall thrive, the 'soil'
being conditioned by regional and sub-regional consi- derations. The other
freedoms which article 19(1) confers are not so restricted by their terms but
that again is not conclusive, of the question under consideration. Nor indeed
does the fact that restraints on the freedoms guaranteed by Article 19(1) can
be imposed under Articles 19(2) to 19(6) by the State furnish any clue to that
question. The State can undoubtedly impose reasonable restrictions on
fundamental freedoms under clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 and those
restrictions, generally, have a territorial operation. But the ambit of a
freedom cannot be measured by the right of a State to pass laws imposing
restrictions on that freedom which, in the generality of cases, have a
geographical limitation.

Article 19(1) (a) guarantees to Indian citizens the right to freedom of speech
and expression. It does not delimit that right in any manner and there is no
reason, arising either out of interpretational dogmas or pragmatic
considerations, why the courts should strain the language of the Article to
cut down the amplitude of that right. The plain meaning of the clause
guaranteeing free speech and expression is that Indian citizens are entitled
to exercise that right wherever they choose, regardless of geographical
considerations, subject of course to the operation of any existing law or the
power of the State to make a law imposing reasonable restrictions in the
interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the
State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or
morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an
offence, as provided in article 19(2). The exercise of the right of free
speech and expression beyond the limits of Indian territory will, of course,
also be subject to the laws of the country in which the freedom is or is
intended to be exercised. I am quite clear that the Constitution does not
confer any power on the executive to prevent the exercise by an Indian citizen
of the right of free speech and expression on foreign soil, subject to what I
have just stated. In fact, that seems to me to be the crux of the matter, for
which reason I said, though with respect, that the form in which the learned
Attorney General stated his proposition was likely to cloud the true issue.
The Constitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms and except where
their exercise is limited by territorial considerations, those freedoms may be
exercised wheresoever one chooses, subject to the exceptions or qualifications
mentioned above.

The next question is whether the right to go out of India is an integral part
of the right of free speech and expression and is comprehended within it. It
seems to me impossible to answer this question in the affirmative as is
contended by the petitioner's counsel, Shri Madan Bhatia. It is possible to
predicate of many a right that its exercise would be more meaningful if the
right is extended to comprehended an extraneous facility. But such extensions
do not form part of the right conferred by the Constitution. The analogy of
the freedom of press being included in the right of free speech and expression
4-119SCI/78 662 is wholly misplaced because the right of free expression
incontrovertibly includes the right of freedom of the press. The right to, go
abroad on one hand and the right of free speech and expression on the other
are made up of basically different constituents, so different indeed that one
cannot be comprehended in the other.

Brother Bhagwati has, on this aspect considered at length certain American
decisions like Kent(1),_Apthekar(2) and Zemel(3) and illuminating though his
analysis is, I am inclined to think that the presence of the due process
clause in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the American Constitution makes
significant difference to the approach of American Judges to the definition
and evaluation of constitutional guarantees. The content which has been
meaningfully and imaginatively poured into "due process of law" may, in my
view, constitute an important point of distinction between the American
Constitution and ours which studiously avoided the use of that expression. In
the Cen- tennial Volume. "The Fourteenth Amendment" edited by Bernard
Schwartz, is contained in an article on 'Landmarks of Legal Liberty' by
Justice William J. Brennan in which the learned Judge quoting from Yeat's play
has this to say : In the service of the ageold dream for recognition of the
equal and inalienable rights of man, the 14th Amendment though 100 years old,
can never be old.

> "Like the poor old women in Yeat's play, "Did you see an old woman going
> down the path?" asked Bridget. "I did not," replied Patrick, who had come
> into the house after the old woman left it, "But I saw a young girl and she
> had the walk of a queen."

Our Constitution too strides in its majesty but, may it be remembered, without
the due process clause, I prefer to be content with a decision directly in
point, All India Bank Employees' Association(4) In which this Court rejected
the contention that the freedom to form associations or unions contained in
article 19 (1 ) (c) carried with it the right that a workers' union could do
all that was necessary to make that right effective, in order to achieve the
purpose for which the union was formed. One right leading to another and that
another to still other, and so on, was described in the abovementioned
decision as productive of a "grotesque result".

I have nothing more to add to what Brother Bhagwati has said on the other
points in the case. I share his opinion that though the right to go abroad is
not included in the right contained in article 19(1)(a), if an order made
under section 10(3)(c) of the Act does in fact violate, the right of free
speech and expression, such an order could be struck down as unconstitutional.
It is well-settled that a statute may pass the test of constitutionality and
yet an order passed under it may be unconstitutional. But of that I will say
no more (1) 2 L. ed. 2d 1204.

because in this branch, one says no more than the facts warrant and decides
nothing that does not call for a decision. The fact that the petitioner was
not heard before or soon after the impounding of her passport would have
introduced a serious infirmity in the order but for the statement of the
Attorney General that the. Government was, willing to hear the petitioner and
further to limit the operation of the order to a period of six months from the
date of the fresh decision, if the decision was adverse to the petitioner. The
order, I agree, does not in fact offend against article 19 (1) (a) or 19 (1)
(g).

1, therefore, agree with the order proposed by Brother Bhagwati.

BHAGWATI, J.-The Petitioner is the holder of the passport issued to her on 1st
June, 1976 under the Passport Act, 1967\. On 4th July, 1977 the Petitioner
received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977 from the Regional Passport Officer,
Delhi intimating to her that it has been decided by the Government of India to
impound her passport under section 10(3)(c) of the Act in public interest and
requiring her to surrender the passport within seven days from the date of
receipt of the letter. The petitioner immediately addressed a letter to the
Regional Passport Officer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of
reasons for making the order as provided in section 10(5) to which a reply was
sent by the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs on 6th July,
1977 stating inter alia that the Government has decided "in the interest of
the general public" not to furnish her a copy of the statement of reasons, for
making of the order. The Petitioner thereupon filed the present petition
challenging the action of the Government in impounding her passport and
declining to give reasons for doing so. The action of the Government was
impugned inter alia on the ground that it was mala fide, but this challenge
was not pressed before us at the time of the hearing of the arguments and
hence it is not necessary to state any facts hearing on that question. The
principal challenge set out in the petition against the legality of the action
of the Government was based mainly on the ground that section 10(3)

(c), in so far as it empowers the Passport Authority to' impound a passport
"in the interests of the general public" is violative of the equality clause
contained in Art. 14 of the Constitution, since the condition denoted by the
words "in the interests of the general public" limiting the exercise of the
power is vague and undefined and the power conferred by this provision is,
therefore, excessive and suffers from the vice of "over-breath." The, petition
also contained a challenge that an order under section 10(3) (c) impounding a
passport could not be made by the Passport Authority without giving an
opportunity to the holder of the passportto be heard in defence and since in
the present case, the passport was impounded by the Government without
affording an apportunity of hearingto the petitioner, the order was null and
void, and in the alternativeif section 10(3) (c) were read in such a manner as
to exclude the right of hearing, the section would be infected with the vice
ofarbitrariness and it would be void as offending Article 14. These were the
only grounds taken in the Petition as originally filed and on 20th July, 1977
the petition was admitted and rule issued by this Court and an interim order
was made directing 664 that the passport of the petitioner should continue to
remain deposited with the Registrar of this Court pending the hearing and
final disposal of the Petition. The hearing of the petition was fixed on 30th
August 1977, but before that, the petitioner filed an application for urging
additional grounds and by this application, two further grounds were sought to
be urged by her. One ground was that section 10(3)(c) is ultra vires Article
21 since it provides for impounding of passport without any procedure as
required by that Article, or, in any event, even if it could be said that
there is some procedure prescribed under the passport Act, 1967, it is wholly
arbitrary and unreasonable and, therefore, not in compliance with the
requirement of that article. The other ground urged on behalf of the
petitioner was that section 10(3)(c) is violative of Articles 19(1)(a) and
19(1)(g) inasmuch as it authorises imposition of restrictions on freedom of
Speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1 ) (a) and freedom to
practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, or business guaranteed
under Article 19(1)(g) and these restrictions are impermissible under Article
19(2) and Article 19(6) respectively. The application for urging these two
additional grounds was granted by this Court and ultimately at the hearing of
the petition these were the two principal grounds which were pressed on behalf
of the petitioner.

Before we examine the rival arguments urged on behalf of the parties in regard
to the various questions arising in this petition, it would be convenient to
set out the relevant provisions of the Passport Act, 1967. This Act was
enacted on 24th June, 1967 in view of the decision of this Court in Satwant
Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer. Government of
India, New Delhi & Ors.(1) The position which obtained prior to the coming
into force of this Act was that there was no law regulating the issue of
passports for leaving the shores of India and going abroad. The issue of
passports was entirely within the discretion of the executive and this
discretion was unguided and unchannelled. This Court, by a majority, bela that
the expression "personal liberty" in Article 21 takes in the right of
locomotion and travel abroad and under Article 21 no person can be deprived of
his right to go abroad except according to the procedure established by law
and since no law had been made by the State regulating or prohibiting the
exercise of such right, the refusal of passport was in violation of Article 21
and moreover the discretion with the executive in the matter of issuing or
refusing passport being unchannelled and arbitrary, it was plainly violative
of Article 14 and hence the order refusing passport to the petitioner was also
invalid under that Article. This decision was accepted by Parliament and the
infirmity pointed out by it was set right by the enactment of the Passports
Act, 1967. This Act, as its preamble shows, was enacted to provide for the
issue of passports and travel documents to regulate the departure from India
of citizens of India and other persons and for incidental and ancillary
matters. Section 3 provides that no person shall depart from or attempt to
depart from India unless be holds in (1) [1967] 3 SCR525.

665

this behalf a valid passport or travel document. What are the different
classes of passports and travel documents which can be issued under the Act is
laid down in section 4. Section 5, sub-section (1) provides for making of an
application for issue of a passport or travel document or for endorsement on
such passport or travel document for visiting foreign country or countries and
sub-section (2) says that on receipt of such application, the passport
authority, after making such inquiry, if any, as it may consider necessary,
shall, by order in writing, issue or refuse to issue the passport or travel
document or make or refuse to make on the passport or travel document
endorsement in respect of. one or more of the foreign countries specified in
the application. Sub-section (3) requires the passport authority, where it
refuses to issue the passport or travel document or to make any endorsement on
the passport or travel document, to record in writing a brief statement of its
reasons for making such order. Section 6, sub-section (1) lays down the
grounds on which the passport authority shall refuse to make an endorsement
for visiting any foreign country and provides that on no other ground the
endorsement shall be refused. There are foul grounds set out in this sub-
section and of them, the last is that, in the opinion of the Central
Government, the presence of the applicant in such foreign country is not in
the public interest. Similarly sub-section (2) of section 6 specifies the
grounds on which alone and on no other grounds the passport authority shall
refuse to issue passport of travel document for visiting any foreign country
and amongst various grounds set out there, the last is that, in the opinion of
the Central Government the issue of passport or travel document to the
applicant will not be in the public interest. Then we come to section 10 which
is the material section which falls for consideration. Sub-section (1) of that
section empowers the passport authority to vary or cancel the endorsement of a
passport or travel document or to vary or cancel the conditions subject to
which a passport or travel document has been issued, having regard, inter
alia, to the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 6 or any notification.
under section 19, Sub-section (2) confers powers on the passport authority to
vary or cancel the conditions of the passport or travel document on
application of the holder of the passport or travel document and with the
previous approval of the Central Government. Sub-section (3) provides that the
passport authority may impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a passport
or travel document on the grounds set out in clauses (a) to

(h), The order impounding the passport in the present case was made by the
Central Government under clause (c) which reads as follows:--

> "(c) if the passport authority deems it necessary so to do in the interest
> of the Sovereignty and Integrity of India, the security of India, friendly
> relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of the
> general public;"

The particular ground relied upon for making the order was that set out in the
last part of clause (c), namely, that the Central Government deems it
necessary to impound the passport "in the interests of the general public."
Then follows sub-section (5) which requires the 666 passport authority
impounding or revoking a passport or travel document or varying or canceling
an endorsement made upon it to "record in writing a brief statement of the
reasons for making such order and furnish to the holder of the passport or
travel document on demand a copy of the same unless, in any case, the passport
authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interests of the
soveriegnty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations
of India with my foreign country or in the interests of the general public to
furnish such a copy." It was in virtue of the provision contained in the
latter part of this sub-section that the Central Government declined to
furnish a copy of the statement of reasons for impounding the passport of the
petitioner on the ground that it was not in the interests of the general
public to furnish such copy to the petitioner. It is indeed a matter of regret
that the Central Government should have taken up this attitude in reply to the
request of the petitioner to be supplied a copy of the statement of reasons,
because ultimately, when the petition came to be filed, the Central Government
did disclose the reasons in the affidavit in reply to the petition which shows
that it was not really contrary to public interest and if we look at the
reasons given in the affidavit in reply, it will be clear that no reasonable
person could possibly have taken the view that the interests of the general
public would be prejudiced by the disclosure of the reasons. This is an
instance showing how power conferred on a statutory authority to act in the,
interests of the general public can sometimes be improperly exercised. If the
petitioner had not filed the petition, she would perhaps never have been able
to find out what were the reasons for which her passport was impounded and she
was deprived of her right to go abroad. The necessity of giving reasons has
obviously been introduced in sub-section (5) so that it may act as a healthy
check against abuse or misuse of power. If the reasons given are not relevant
and there is no nexus between the reasons and the ground on which the passport
has been impounded, it would be open to the holder of the passport to
challenge the order impounding it in a court of law and if the court is
satisfied that the reasons are extraneous or irrelvant, the court would strike
down the order. This liability to be exposed to judicial scrutiny would by
itself act as a safeguard against improper or mala fide exercise of power. The
court would, therefore, be very slow to accept, without close scrutiny, the
claim of the passport authority that it would not be in the interests of the
general public to disclose the reasons. The passport authority would have to
satisfy the court by placing proper material that the giving of reasons would
be clearly and indubitably against the interests of the general public and if
the Court is not so satisfied, the Court may require the passport authority to
disclose the reasons, subject to any valid and lawful claim for privilege
which may be set up on behalf of the Government. Here in the present case, as
we have already pointed out, the Central Government did initially claim that
it would be against the interests of the general public to disclose the
reasons for impounding the passport, but when it, came to filing the affidavit
in reply, the Central Government very properly abandoned this unsustainable
claim and disclosed the reasons The question whether these reasons have any
nexus with the interests of the general public or they are extraneous and
irrelevant is a matter 667 which we shall examine when we deal with the
arguments of the parties, ,Meanwhile, proceeding further with the resume of
the relevant provisions, reference may be made to section 11 which provides
for an appeal inter alia against the order impounding or revoking a passport
or travel document under sub-section (3) of section 10. But there is a proviso
to this section which says that if the order impounding or revoking a passport
or travel document is passed by the Central Government, there shall be no
right to appeal. These are the relevant provisions of the Act in the light of
which we have to consider the constitutionality of sub- section (3) (c) of
section 10 and the validity of the order impounding the passport of the
petitioner. Meaning and content of personal liberty in article 21 The first
contention urged on behalf of the petitioner in support of the petition was
that the right to go abroad is part of 'personal liberty within the meaning of
that expression as used in Article 21 and no one can. be deprived of this
right except according to the procedure prescribed by law. There is no
procedure prescribed by the Passport Act, 1967 for impounding or revoking a
passport and thereby preventing the holder of the passport from going abroad
and in any event, even if some procedure can be traced in the relevant
provisions of the Act, it is unreasonable and arbitrary, inasmuch as it does
not provide for giving an opportunity to the holder of the passport to be
heard against the making of the order and hence the action of the central
Government in impounding the passport of the petitioner is in violation of
Article 21. This contention of the petitioner raises a question as to the true
interpretation of Article 21, what is the nature and extent of the protection
afforded by this article ? What is the meaning of 'personal liberty' : does it
include the right to go abroad so that this right cannot be abridged or taken
away except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law ? What is the
inter-relation between Art. 14 and Article 21 ? Does Article 21 merely require
that there Must be some semblance of procedure, howsoever arbitrary or
fanciful, prescribed by law before a person can be deprived of his personal
liberty or that the procedure must satisfy certain requisites in the sense
that it must be fair and reasonable ? Article 21 occurs in Part III of the
Constitution which confers certain fundamental rights. These fundamental
rights had their roots deep in the struggle for independence and, as pointed
out by Granville Austin in 'The Indian Constitution-Cornerstone of a Nation',
"they were included in the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one
day the tree of true liberty would bloom in India". They were indelibly
written in the sub-conscious memory of the race which fought for well-nigh
thirty years for securing freedom from British rule and they found expression
in the form of fundamental rights when the Constitution was enacted. These
fundamental rights represent the basic values cherished by the people of this
country since the Vedic times and they are calculated to protect the dignity
of the individual and create conditions in which every human being can develop
his personality to the fullest extent. They weave a "pattern of guarantees on
the basic-structure of human rights" and impose negative obligations on the
State not to encroach on indi-

668

vidual liberty in its various dimensions. It is apparent from the enunciation
of these rights that the, respect for the individual and his capacity for
individual volition which finds expression there is not a self fulfilling
prophecy. Its purpose is to help the individual to find his own liability, to
give expression to his creativity and to prevent governmental and other forces
from 'alienating' the individual from his creative impulses. These rights are
wide ranging and comprehensive and they fall under seven heads, namely, right
to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of
religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and right to
constitutional remedies. Articles 14 to 18 occur under the heading 'Right to,
Equality', and of them, by far the most important is Article 14 which confers
a fundamental right by injuncting the State not to "deny to any person
equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the
territory of India". Articles 19 to 22, which find place under the heading
"Right to freedom provide for different aspects of freedom. Clause (1) of
Article 19 enshrines what may be described as the seven lamps of freedom. It
provides that all citizens shall have the right-(a) to freedom of speech and
expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form
associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;
(e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to
acquire, hold and dispose of property and (g) to practise any profession or to
carry on any occupation, trade or business,. But these freedoms are not and
cannot be absolute, for absolute and unrestricted freedom of one may be
destructive of the freedom of another and in a well-ordered, civilised
society, freedom can only be regulated freedom. Therefore, clauses (2) to (6)
of Art. 19 permit reasonable restrictions to be imposed on the exercise of the
fundamental rights guaranteed under clause'(1) of that article. Article 20
need not detain us as, that is not material for the determination of the
controversy between the parties. Then comes Article 21 which provides :

> "21. No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except
> according to procedure established by law."

Article 22 confers protection against arrest and detention in certain cases
and provides inter alia safeguards in case of preventive detention. The other
fundamental rights are not relevant to, the present discussion and we, need
not refer to them.

It is obvious that Article 21, though couched in negative language, confers
the fundamental right to life and personal liberty. So far as the right to
personal liberty is concerned, it is ensured by providing that no one shall be
deprived of personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed by law.
The first question that arises for con- sideration on the language of Article
21 is : what is the meaning and content of the words 'personal liberty' as
used in this article ? This question incidently came up for discussion in some
of the judgments in A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras(1) and the observations
made by Patanjali Sastri, J., Mukherjee, J., and S. R. Das, J., seemed to
place a narrow interpretation on the words 'personal liberty' so as to confine
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.

669

the protection of Article 21 to freedom of the person against unlawful
detention. But there was no definite pronouncement made on this point since
the question before the Court was not so much the interpretation of the words
'personal liberty' as the inter-relation between Article 19 and 21. It was in
Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors.(1) that the question as to the, proper
scope and meaning of the expression personal liberty' came up pointedly for
consideration for the first time before this Court. The majority of the Judges
took the view "that personal liberty' is used in the article as a compendious
term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up
the personal liberties' of man other than those dealt with in the several
clauses of Article 19(1). In other words, while Article 19(1) deals with
particular species or attributes of that freedom, 'personal liberty' in
Article 21 takes in and comprises the residue". The Minority judges, however,
disagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their position in
the following words : "No doubt the expression 'personal liberty' is a
comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal
liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal
liberty and, therefore, the expression 'personal liberty' in Article 21
excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both are
independent fundamental rights, though there is overlapping. There is no
question of one being carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and
personal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in Article 19.
If a person's fundamental right under Article 21 is infringed, the State can
rely upon a law to sustain the action, but that cannot be a complete answer
unless the said law satisfies the test laid down in Article 19(2) so far as
the attributes covered by Article 19(1) are concerned". There can be no doubt
that in view of the decision of this Court in R. C. Cooper v. Union of
India(2) the minority view must be regarded as correct and the majority view
must be held to have been overruled. We shall have occasion to analyse and
discuss the decision in R. C. Cooper's case a little later when we deal with
the arguments based on infraction of Articles 19(1) (a) and 19 (1) (g), but it
is sufficient to state for the present that according to this decision, which
was a decision given by the full Court, the fundamental rights conferred by
Part III are not distinct and mutually exclusive rights. Each freedom has
different dimensions and merely because the limits of interference with one
freedom are satisfied, the .law is not freed from the necessity to meet the
challenge of another guaranteed freedom. The decision in A. K. Gopalan's
(supra) case gave rise to the theory that the freedoms under Articles 19, 21,
22 and 31 are exclusive-each article enacting a code relating to the
protection of distinct rights, but this theory was over-turned in R. C.
Cooper's case (supra) where Shah, J., speaking on behalf of the majo- rity
pointed out that "Part III of the Constitution weaves a pattern of guarantees
on the texture of basic human: rights. The guarantees delimit the protection
of those rights in their allotted fields : they do not attempt to enunciate
distinct rights." The conclusion was summarised in these terms : "In our
judgment, the assumption in A. K. (1) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 332.

(2) [1973] 3 S.C.R. 530.

670

Gopalan's case that certain articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with
specific matters cannot be accepted as correct". It was hold in R. C. Cooper's
case and that is clear from the judgment of Shah, J., because Shah, J., in so
many terms disapproved of the contrary statement of law contained in the
opinions of Kania, C. J., Patanjali Sastri, J., Mahajan, J., Mukherjee, J.,
and S. R. Das, J., in A. K. Gopalan's case that even where a person is
detained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, as mandated by
Article 21, the protection conferred by the various clauses of Article 19(1)
does not cease to be available to him and the law authorising such detention
has to satisfy the test of the applicable freedom under Article 19, clause
(1). This would clearly show that Articles 19(1) and 21 are not mutually
exclusive, for, if they were, there would be no question of a law depriving a
person of personal liberty within the meaning of Article 21 having to meet the
challenge of a fundamental right under Article 19(1). Indeed, in that event, a
law of preventive detention which deprives a person of 'personal liberty' in
the narrowest sense, namely, freedom from detention and thus falls
indisputably within Art. 21 would not require to be tested on the touchstone
of clause (d) of Article 19 (1) and yet it was held by a Bench of seven Judges
of this Court in Shambhu Nath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal& Ors. (1)
that such a law would have to satisfy the requirement inter alia of Article 19
(1), clause (d) and in Haradhan Saha v. The State, of West Bengal & Ors., (2)
which was a decision given by a Bench of five judges, this Court considered
the challenge of clause (d) of Article 19(1) to the constitutional validity of
the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 and held that that Act did not
violate the constitutional guarantee embodied in that article. It is indeed
difficult to see on what principle we can refuse to give its plain natural
meaning to the expression ' personal liberty' as used in Article 21 and read
it in a narrow and restricted sense so as to exclude those attributes of
personal liberty which are specifically dealt with in Article 19. We do not
think that this would be a correct way of interpreting the provisions of the
Cons- titution conferring fundamental rights. The attempt of the court should
be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental rights rather than
attenuate their meaning and content by a process of judicial construction. The
wave length for comprehending the scope and ambit of the fundamental rights
has been set by this Court in R. C. Cooper's case and our approach in the
interpretation of the fundamental rights must now be in tune with this wave,
length. We may point out even at the cost of repetition that this Court has
said in so; many terms in R. C. Cooper's case that each freedom has different
dimensions and there may be overlapping between different fundamental rights
and therefore it is not a' valid argument to say that the expression 'personal
liberty' in Article 21 must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping between
that article and Article 19(1). The expression 'personal liberty' in Article
21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to
constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to
the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection
under Article 19. Now, it has been (1) [1973] 1 SCR 856.

(2) [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778.

671

held by this Court in Satwant Singh's case that 'personal liberty' within the
meaning of Article 21 includes within its ambit the right to go abroad and
consequently no person can be deprived of this right except according to
procedure prescribed by law. Prior to the enactment of the Passports Act,
1967, there was no law regulating the right of a person to go abroad and that
was the reason why the order of the Passport Officer refusing to issue
passport to the petitioner in Satwant Singh's case was struck down as invalid.
It win be seen at once from the language of Article 21 that the protection it
secures is a limited one. It safeguards the right to go abroad against
executive interference which is not supported by law; and law here means 'en-.
acted law' or 'State Law'. Vide A. K. Gopalan's case. Thus, no person can be
deprived of his right to, go abroad unless there is a law made by the State
prescribing the procedure for so depriving him and the deprivation is effected
strictly in accordance with such procedure. It was for this reason, in order
to comply with the requirement of Article 21, that Parliament enacted the
Passports Act, 1967 for regulating the tight to go abroad. It is clear from
the provisions of the Passports, Act, 1967 that is lays down the circumstances
under which a passport may be issued or refused or cancelled or impounded and
also prescribes a procedure for doing so, but the question is whether that is
sufficient compliance with Article 21. Is the prescription of some sort of
procedure enough or must the procedure comply with any particular requirements
? Obviously, procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable. This
indeed was conceded by the learned Attorney General who with his usual candour
frankly stated that it was not possible for him to contend that any procedure
howsoever arbitrary, oppressive or unjust may be prescribed by the law. There
was some discussion in A. K. Gopalan's case in regard to the nature of the
procedure required to be prescribed under Article 21 and at least three of the
learned Judges out of five expressed themselves strongly in favour of the view
that the procedure cannot be any arbitrary, fantastic or oppressive procedure.
Fazal Ali, J., who was in a minority, went to the farthest limit in saying
that the procedure must include the four essentials, set out in Prof. Willi's
book on Constitutional Law, namely, notice, opportunity to be heard, impartial
tribunal and ordinary course of procedure. Patanjali Sastri, J. did not go as
far as that but he did say that "certain basic principles emerged as the
constant factors known to all those procedures and they formed the core of the
procedure established by law." Mahajan, J., also observed that Article 21
requires that "there should be some form of proceeding before a person can be
condemned either in respect of his life or his liberty" and "it negatives the
idea of fantastic, arbitrary and oppressive forms of proceedings". But apart
altogether from these observations in A. K. Gopalan's case, which have great
weight, we find that even on principle the concept of reasonableness must be
projected in the procedure contemplated by Article 21,, having regard to the
impact of Article 14 on Article 21.

672

The inter-relationship between articles 14, 19 and 21 We may at this stage
consider the inter-relation between Article 21 on the one hand and Articles 14
and 19 on the other. We have already pointed out that the view taken by the
majority in A. K. Gopalan's case war,. that so long as a law of preventive
detention satisfies the requirements of Article 22, it would be within the
terms of Article 21 and it would not be required to meet the challenge of
Article

19\. This view proceeded on the assumption that "certain articles in the
constitution exclusively deal with specific matters" and where the
requirements of an article dealing with the particular matter in question are
satisfied and there is no infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by
that article, no recourse can be had to a fundamental right conferred by
another article. This doctrine of exclusivity was seriously questioned in R.
C. Cooper's case and it was over-ruled by a majority of the Full Court, only
Ray, J., as he then was, dissenting. The majority judges held that though a
law of preventive detention may pass the test of Article 22, it has yet to
satisfy the requirements of other fundamental rights such as Article 19. The
ratio of the majority judgment in R. C. Cooper's case was explained in clear
and categorical terms by Shelat, J., speaking on behalf of seven judges of
this Court in Shambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of West Bengal(1). The learned
Judge there said :

> "In Gopalan's case (supra) the majority court had held that Article 22 was a
> self-contained Code and therefore a law of preventive detention did not have
> to satisfy the require- ment of Articles 19, 14 and 21. The view of Fazal
> Ali, J., on the other hand, was that preventive detention was a direct
> breach of the right under Article 19 (1) (d) and that a law providing for
> preventive detention. had to be subject to such judicial review as is
> obtained under clause (5) of that Article. In R. C. Cooper v. Union of
> India, (supra) the aforesaid premise, of the majority in Gopalan's case
> (supra) was disapproved and therefore it no longer holds the field. Though
> Cooper's case (supra) dealt with the inter-relationship of Article 19 and
> Article 31, the basic approach to construing the fundamental rights
> guaranteed in the different provisions of the Constitution adopted in this
> case held the major premise of the majority in Gopalan's case (supra) to be
> incorrect."

Subsequently, in Haradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal & Ors.(2) also, a Bench
of five Judges of this Court, after referring to the decisions in A. K.
Gopalan's case and R. C. Cooper's case, agreed that the Maintenance of
Internal Security Act, 1971, which is a law of preventive detention, has to be
tested in regard to its reasonableness with reference to Article 19. That
decision accepted and applied the ratio in R. C. Cooper's case and Shambhu
Nath Sarkar's case and proceeded to consider the challenge of Article 19 to
the constitutional validity of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971
and held that the Act did not violate any of the constitutional guarantees
enshrined in Art. 19. The same view was affirmed once again by a Bench of four
(1) [1973] S.C.R.856.

(1) [1975] S.C.R.778.

673

judges of this Court in Khudiram Das v. The State of West Bengal & Ors.(1)
Interestingly, even prior to these decisions, as pointed out by Dr. Rajive
Dhawan, in his book : "The Supreme Court of India :" at page 235, reference
was made, by this court in Mohd. Sabir v. State of Jammu and Kashmir(2) to
article 191(2) to justify preventive; deten- tion. The law, must, therefore,
now be taken to be well settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19
and that even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person
of 'personal liberty' and there is consequently no infringement of the
fundamental right conferred by Article 21, such law, in so far as it abridges
or takes away any fundamental right under Article 19 would have to meet the
challenge of that article. This proposition can no longer be disputed after
the decisions in R. C. Cooper's case, Shambhu Nath Sarkar's case and Haradhan
Saha's case. Now, if a law depriving a person of 'personal liberty' and
prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the meaning of Article 21 has
to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under
Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must
also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14. This was in fact not
disputed by the learned Attorney General and indeed he could not do so in view
of the clear and categorical statement made by Mukharjea, J., in A. K.
Gopalan's case that Article 21 "presupposes that the law is a valid and
binding law under the provisions of the Constitution having regard to the
competence of the legislature and the subject it relates to and does not
infringe any of the fundamental rights which the Constitution provides for",
including Article 14. This Court also applied Article 14 in two of its earlier
decisions, namely, The State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar(3) and Kathi
Raning Rawat v. The State of Saurashtra(4) where there was a special law
providing for trial of certain offences by a speedier process which took away
some of the safeguards available to an accused under the ordinary procedure in
the Criminal Procedure Code. The special law in each of these two cases
undoubtedly pres- cribed a procedure for trial of the specified offences and
this procedure could not be condemned as inherently unfair or unjust and there
was thus compliance with the requirement of Article 21, but even so, the
validity of the special law was tested before the Supreme, Court on the
touchstone of Article 14 and in one case, namely, Kathi Raning Rawat's case,
the validity was upheld and in the other, namely, Anwar Ali Sarkar's case, it
was struck down. It was held in both these cases that the procedure
established by the special law must not be violative of the equality clause.
That procedure must answer the requirement of Article 14. The nature and
requirement of the procedure under article

21\. Now, the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of
Article 14 : what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle
enunciated in this article ? There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith
of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which (1) [1975] 2 S.C.R.832.

rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it
must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach._ No
attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for, to
do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic
concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned Within
traditional and doctrinaire limits. We must reiterate here what was pointed
out by the majority in E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu & Another (1)
namely, that "from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to
arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one
belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and
caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in
it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law
and is therefore violative of Article 14". Article 14 strikes, at arbi-
trariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The
principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an
essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a
brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer
the best of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It
must be "'right and just and fair" and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive;
otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21
would not be satisfied. How far natural justice is air essential element of
procedure established by law.

The question immediately arises : does the procedure prescribed by the
Passports Act, 1967 for impounding a passport meet the, test of this
requirement ? Is it 'right or fair or just' ? The argument of the petitioner
was that it is not, because it provides for impounding of a passport without
affording reasonable opportunity to the holder of the passport to be heard in
defence. To impound the passport of a person, said the petitioner, is a
serious matter, since it prevents him from exercising his constitutional right
to go abroad and such a drastic consequence cannot in fairness be visited
without observing the principle of audi alteram partem. Any procedure which
permits impairment of the constitutional right to go abroad without giving
reasonable opportunity to show cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and
unjust and hence, there is in the present case clear infringement of the
requirement of Article 21. Now, it is true that there is no express provision
in the Passports Act, 1967 which requires that the audi alteram partem rule
should be followed before impounding a passport, but that is not conclusive of
the question. If the statute makes itself clear on this point, then no more
question arises. But even when the statute is silent, the law may in a given
case make an implication and apply the principle stated by Byles, J., in
Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works(2). "A long course of decision---,
beginning with Dr. Bentley's case and ending with some very recent cases,
establish that, although there are no positive words in the statute requiring
that the party shall be heard, yet-the justice of the common law will supply
the omission of (1) [1974]2S.C.R.348.

675

the legislature". The principle of audi alteram partem, which mandates that no
one shall be condemned unheard, part of the rules of natural justice. In fact,
there are two main principles in which the rules of natural justice are
manifested, namely, Nemo Judex in Sua Causa and audi alteram partem. We are
not concerned here with the former, since there is no case of bias urged here.
The question is only in regard to the right of hearing which involves the audi
alteram partem rule. Can it be imported in the procedure for impounding a
passport ?

We may commence the discussion of this question with a few general
observations to emphasise the increasing importance of natural justice in the
field of administrative law. Natural justice is a great humanising principle
intended to invest law with' fairness and to secure justice and over the years
it has grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas of
administrative action. Lord Morris of Borth- y-Gest spoke of this rule in
eloquent terms in his address before the Bentham Club :

> "We can, I think, take pride in what has been done in recent periods and
> particularly in the field of administrative law by invoking and by applying
> these principles which we broadly classify under the designation of natural
> justice. Many testing problems as to their application yet remain to be
> solved. But I affirm that the area of administrative action is but one area
> in which the principles are to be deployed. Nor are they to be invoked only
> when procedural failures are shown. Does natural justice qualify to be
> described as a "majestic" conception ? I believe it does. Is it just a
> rhetorical but vague phrase which can be employed, when needed, to give a
> gloss of assurance ? I believe that it is very much more. If it can be
> summarised as being fair play in action-who could wish that it would ever be
> out of action ? It denotes that the law is not only to be guided by reason
> and by logic but that its purpose %,,ill not be fulfilled; it lacks more
> exalted inspiration." (Current Legal Pro-

blems, 1973, Vol. 26, p. 16) And then again, in his speech in the House of
Lords in Wiseman v. Borneman(1), the learned Law Lord said in words of
inspired felicity:

> "that the conception of natural justice should at all stages guide those who
> discharge judicial functions is not merely an acceptable but is an essential
> part of the philosophy of the law. We often speak of the rules of natural
> justice. But there is nothing rigid or mechanical about them. What they
> comprehend has been analysed and described in many authorities. But any
> analysis must bring into relief rather their spirit and their inspiration
> than any precision of definition or precision as to application. We do not

Thus, the soul of natural justice is fair play in action' and that is why it
has received the widest recognition throughout the democratic world. In the
United States, the right to an administrative hearing is regarded as essential
requirement of fundamental fairness. And in England too it has been held that
'fair play in action' demands that before any prejudicial or adverse action is
taken against a person, he must be given an opportunity to be heard. The rule
was stated by Lord Henning, M.R. in these terms in Schmidt v. Secretary of
State for Home Affairs(1) :-where a public officer has power to deprive a
person of his liberty or his property, the general principle is that it has
not to be done without his being given an opportunity of being heard and of
making representations on his own behalf". The same rule also prevails in
other Commonwealth countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It has
even gained access to the United Nations. Vide American Journal of
International Law, Vol. 67, page

479\. Magarry, J., describes natural justice "as a distillate of due process
of law". Vide Fontaine v. Chesterton(2). It is the quintessence of the process
of justice inspired and guided by fair play in action'. If we look at the
speeches of the various law Lords in Wiseman's case, it will be seen that each
one of them asked the question "whether in the particular circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal acted unfairly so that it could be said that their
procedure did not match with what justice demanded", ,or, was the procedure
adopted by the Tribunal 'in all the circumstances unfair'? The test adopted by
every law Lord was whether the procedure followed was "fair in all the
circumstances" and 'fair play in action' required that an opportunity should
be given to the tax payer "to see and reply to the counter-statement of the
Commissioners" before reaching the conclusion that "there is a prima facie
case against him." The inquiry must, therefore, always be : does fairness in
action demand that an opportunity to be heard should be given to the person
affected ? Now, if this be the test of applicability of the doctrine of
natural justice, there can be no distinction between a quasi-judicial function
and an administrative function for this purpose. The aim of both
administrative inquiry as well as quasi-judicial inquiry is to arrive at a
just decision and if a rule of natural justice Is calculated to secure
justice, or to put it negatively, to prevent miscarriage of justice, it is
difficult to see why it should be applicable to quasi-judicial inquiry and not
to administrative inquiry. It must logically apply to both. On what principle
can distinction be made between one and the other ? Can it be said that the
requirement of 'fair play in action' is any the (1) [1969] 2 Chancery Division

less in an administrative inquiry than in a quasi--judicial one? Sometimes an
unjust decision in an administrative inquiry may have far more serious
consequences than a decision in a quasi-judicial inquiry and hence the rules
of natural justice must apply equally in an administrative inquiry which
entails-civil consequences. There was, however, a time in the early stages of
the development of the doctrine of natural justice when the view prevailed
that the rules of natural justice have application only to a quasi-judicial
proceeding as distinguished from an administrative proceeding and the
distinguishing feature of a quasi-judicial proceeding is that the authority
concerned is required by the, law under which it is functioning to act
judicially. This requirement of a duty to act judicially in order to invest
the function with a quasi,judicial character was spelt out from the following
observation of Atkin, L.J. in Rex v. Electricity Commissioners(1), "wherever
any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting
the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess
of their legal authority, they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of
the King Bench Division. . . .". Lord Hewart, C.J., in Rex V. Legislative
Committee of the Church Assembly, ( 2 ) read this observation to mean that the
duty to act judicially should be an additional requirement existing
independently of the "authority to determine questions affecting the rights of
subjects"-something super added to it. This gloss placed by Lord Hewart, C.J.,
on the dictum of Lord Atkin, L.J., bedevilled the law for a considerable time
and stultified the growth of the doctrine of natural justice. The Court was
constrained in every case that came before it, to make a search for the duty
to act judicially sometimes from tenuous material and sometimes in the
services of the statute and this led to oversubtlety and over-refinement
resulting in confusion and uncertainty in the law. But this was plainly
contrary to the earlier authorities and in the epoch-making decision of the
House of Lords in Ridge v. Baldwin(3), which marks a turning point in the
history of the development of the doctrine of natural justice, Lord Reid
pointed out how the gloss of Lord Hewart, C.J., was based on a
misunderstanding of the; observations of Atkin, L.J., and it went counter to
the law laid down in the earlier decisions, of the Court. Lord Reid observed :
"If Lord Hewart meant that it is never enough that a body has a duty to
determine what the rights of an individual should be, but that there must
always be something more to impose on it a duty to act judicially, then that
appears to me impossible to reconcile with the earlier authorities". The
learned law Lord held that the duty to act judicially may arise from the very
nature of the function intended to be performed' and it need not be shown to
be superadded. This decision, broadened the area of application of the rules
of natural justice and to borrow the words of Prof. Clar in his article on
'Natural Justice, Substance and Shadow' in Public Law Journal, 1975, restored
light to an area "benighted by the narrow conceptualism of the previous
decade". This development in the law had its parallel in India in the
Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. P. N. Sharma & Anr(4) where (1) [1924] 1
K.B.171.

5-119 SCT/78 678 this Court approvingly referred to the decision in Ridge v.
Baldwin (supra) and, later in State of Orissa v. Dr. Binapani(1) observed that
: "If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person,
duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power". This Court
also, pointed out in A.K. Kraipak & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (2) another
historic decision in this branch of the law, that in recent years the concept
of quasi-judicial power has been undergoing radical change and said: "The
dividing line between an administrative power and a quasi- judicial power is
quite thin and is being gradually oblite- rated, for determining whether a
power is an administrative, power or a quasi-judicial power one has to look to
the nature of the power conferred, the person or persons on whom it is
conferred, the framework of the law conferring that power, the consequences
ensuing from the exercise of that power and the manner in which that power is
expected to be exercised". The net effect of these and other decisions was
that the duty to act judicially need not be super-added, but it may be spelt
out from the nature of the power conferred, the manner of exercising it and
its impact on the rights of the person effected and where it is found to
exist, the rules of, natural justice would be attracted. This was the advance
made by the law as a result of the decision in Ridge v. Baldwin (supra) in
England and the decision in Associated Cement Companies's case (supra) and
other cases following upon it, in India. But that was not to be the end of the
development of the law on this subject. The proliferation of administrative
law provoked considerable fresh thinking on the subject and soon it came to be
recognised that 'fair play in action' required that in administrative
proceeding also, the doctrine of natural justice must be held to be
applicable. We have already discussed this aspect of the question on principal
and shown why no distinction can be made between an administrative and a
quasi-judicial proceeding for the; purpose of applicability of the doctrine of
natural justice. This position was judicially recognised and accepted and the
dichotomy between administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings vis-a-vis
doctrine of natural justice was finally discarded as unsound by the decisions
in In re : H.K. (All Infant) (3) and Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home
Affairs (supra) in England and, so far as India is concerned, by the memorable
decision rendered by this Court in A.K. Kraipak's case (supra). Lord Parker,
C.J. pointed out in the course of his judgment in In Re : H.K. (An Infant)
(supra) :

This Court, speaking through Hegde, J., in ,I. K. Kraipak's case quoted with
approval the above passage from the judgment of Lord Parker, C.J., and
proceeded to add :

> "The aim of the rules of natural justice is to secure justice or to put it

pounded a passport is other than the Central Government, a right of appeal
against the order impounding the passport is given by section 11, and in the
appeal, the validity of the reasons given by the Passport Authority for
impounding the passport can be canvassed before the Appellate Authority. It is
clear on a consideration of these circumstances that the test laid down in the
decisions of this Court for distinguishing between a quasi-judicial power and
an administrative power is satisfied and the power conferred on the Passport
Authority to impound a passport is quasi-judicial power. The rules of natural
justice would, in the circumstances, be applicable in the exercise of the
power of impounding a passport even on the orthodox view which prevailed prior
to A. K. Kraipak's case. The same result must follow in view of the decision
in A. K. Kraipak's case, even if the power to impound a passport were regarded
as administrative in character, because it seriously interferes with the
constitutional right of the holder of the passport to go abroad and entails
adverse civil consequences.

Now, as already pointed out, the doctrine of natural justice consists
principally of two rules, namely, nemo debt esse judex propria cause : no one
shall be a judge in his own cause, and audi alteram partem : no decision shall
be given against a party without affording him a reasonable hearing. We are
concerned here with the second rule and hence we shall confine ourselves only
to a discussion of that rule. The learned Attorney General, appearing on
behalf of the Union of India, fairly conceded that the audi alteram partem
rule is a highly effective tool devised by the courts to enable a statutory
authority to arrive at a just decision and it is calculated to act as a
healthy check on abuse or misuse of power and hence its reach should not be
narrowed and its applicability circum- scribed. He rightly did not plead for
reconsideration of the historic advances made in the law as a result of the
decisions of this Court and did (1) [1973] 3S.C.C.864.

681

not suggest that the Court should re-trace its steps. That would indeed have
been a most startling argument coming from the Government of India and for the
Court to accede to such an argument would have been so act of utter
retrogression. But fortunately no such argument was advanced by the learned
Attorney General. What he urged was a very limited contention, namely that
having regard to the nature of the action involved in the impounding of a
passport, the audi alteram partem rule must be held to, be excluded, because
if notice were to be given to the hol- der of the passport and reasonable
opportunity afforded to him to show cause why his passport should not be
impounded, he might immediately, on the strength of the passport, make good
his exit from the country and the object of impounding the passport would be
frustrated. The argument was that if the audi alteram partem rule were
applied, its effect would be to stultify the power of impounding the passport
and it would defeat and paralyse the administration of the law and hence the
audi alteram partem rule cannot in fairness be applied while exercising the
power to impound a passport. This, argument was sought to be supported by
reference to the statement of the law in A.S. de Smith, Judicial Review of
Administrative Action, 2nd ed., where the learned author says at page 174 that
"in administrative, law a prima facie right to prior notice and opportunity to
be heard may be held to be excluded by implication-where an obligation to give
notice and opportunity to be heard would obstruct the taking of prompt action,
especially action of a preventive or remedial nature". Now, it is true that
since the right to prior notice and opportunity of hearing arises only by
implication from the duty to act fairly, or to use the words of Lord Morris of
Borth-y-Gest, from 'fair play in action, it may equally be excluded where,
having regard to the nature of the action to be taken, its object and purpose
and the scheme of the relevant statutory provision, fairness in action does
not demand its implication and even warrants its exclusion. There are certain
well recognised exceptions to the audi alteram partem rule established by
judicial decisions and they are summarised by S.A. de Smith in Judicial Review
of Administrative Action, 2nd ed., at page 168 to 179. If we analyse these
exceptions a little closely, _it will be apparent that they do not in any way
militate against the principle which requires fair play in administrative
action. The word 'exception' is really a misnomer because in these
exclusionary cases the audi alteram partem rule is held inapplicable not by
way of an exception to "fair play in action", but because nothing unfair can
be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case. The
audi alteram partem rule is intended to inject justice into the law and it
cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice, or to make the law 'lifeless,
absurd, stultifying, self-defeating or plainly contrary to the common sense of
the situation'. Since the life of the law is not logic but experience and
every legal proposition must, in the ultimate analysis, be tested on the
touchstone of pragmatic realism, the audi alteram partem rule would, by the
experiential test, be excluded, if importing the right to be heard has the
effect of paralysing the administrative process or the need for promptitude or
the urgency of the situation so demands. But at the same time it must be
remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of
administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional
circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands.

682

It is a wholesome rule designed to- secure the rule of law and the court
should not be too ready to eschew it in its application to a given case. True
rue it is that in questions of this kind a fanatical or doctrinaire ap- proach
should be avoided, but that does not mean that merely because the traditional
methodology of a formalised hearing may have the effect of stultifying the
exercise of the statutory power, the audi alteram partem should be wholly
excluded. The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to
the maximum extent permissible in a given case. It must not be forgotten that
"natural justice is pragmatically flexible and is amenable to capsulation
under the compulsive pressure of circumstances". The audi alteram partem rule
is not cast in a rigid mould and judicial decisions establish that it may
suffer situational modifications. The core of it must, however, remain,
namely, that the per%on affected must have a reasonable opportunity of being
heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public
relations exercise. That is why Tucker, L.J., emphasised in Russel v. Duke of
Norfolk(1) that "whatever standard of natural justice is adopted, one
essential is that the person concerned should have a reasonable oppor- tunity
of presenting his case". What opportunity may be regarded as reasonable would
necessarily depend on the practical necessities of the situation. It may be a
sophisticated fullfledged hearing or it may be a hearing which is very brief
and minimal : it may be a hearing prior to the decision or it may even be a
post-decisional remedial hearing. The audi alteram partem rule is sufficiently
flexible to permit modifications and variations to suit the exigencies of
myriad kinds of situations which max, arise. This circumstantial flexibility
of the audi alteram partem rule was empbasised by Lord Reid in Wiseman v.
Sorneman (supra) when he said that he would be "sorry to see this fundamental
general principle degenerate into a series of hard and fast rules" and Lord
Hailsham, L.C., also observed in Pearl-Berg V. Party(2) that the courts "have
taken in increasingly sophisticated view of what is required in individual
cases". It would not, therefore, be right to conclude that the audi alteram
partem rule is excluded merely because the power to impound a passport might
be frustrated, if prior notice and hearing were to be given to the person
concerned before impounding his passport. the Passport Authority may proceed
to impound the passport without giving any prior opportunity to the person
concerned to be heard, but as soon as the order impounding the passport is
made, and opportunity of hearing, remedial in aim, should be given to him so
that he may present his case and controvert that of the Passport Authority and
point out why his passport should not be impounded and the order impounding it
recalled. This should not only be possible but also quite appropriate, because
the reasons for impounding the passport are required to be supplied by the
Passport Authority after the making of the order and the person affected
would, therefore, be in a position to make a representation setting forth his
case and plead for setting aside the action impounding his passport. A fair
opportunity of being heard following immediately upon the order impounding the
passport would satisfy the mandate of natural justice and a provision
requiring giving of such opportunity to the person concerned can and should be
read by (1) [1949] 1 All Eng. Reports 109.

implication in the Passports Act, 1967. If such a provision were held to be
incorporated in the Passports, Act, 1967 by necessary implication, as we hold
it must be, the procedure prescribed by the Act for impounding a passport
would be fight, fair and just and it would not suffer from the vice of
arbitrariness or unreasonableness. We must, therefore, hold that the procedure
'established' by the Passports Act, 1967 for impounding a passport is in
conformity with the requirement of Article 21 and does not fall foul of that
article.

But the question then immediately arises whether the Central Government has
complied with this procedure in impounding the passport of the Petitioner.
Now, it is obvious and indeed this could not be controverted that the Central
Government not only did not give an opporgive an opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner after making the impugned order im- pounding her passport but even
declined to furnish to the petitioner the reasons for impounding her passport
despite request made by her. We have already pointed out that the Central
Government was wholly unjustified in withholding the reasons for impounding
the passport from the petitioner and this was not only in breach of the
statutory provision, but it also amounted to denial of opportunity of hearing
to the petitioner. The order impounding the passport of the petitioner was,
therefore, clearly in violation of the rule of natural justice embodied in the
maxim audi alteram partem and it was not in conformity with the procedure
prescribed by the Passports Act, 1967. Realising that this was a fatal defect
which would void the order impounding the passport, the learned Attomey-
General made a statement on behalf of the Government of India to the following
effect :

"1. The Government is agreeable to considering any representation that may be
made by the petitioner in respect of the impounding of her passport and giving
her an opportunity in the matter. The opportunity will be, given within two
weeks of the receipt of the representation. It is clarified that in the
present case the grounds for impounding the passport are those mentioned in
the affidavit in reply dated 18th August, 1977 of Shri Ghosh except those
mentioned in para 2 (xi).

2.The representation of the petitioner will be dealt with expeditiously in
accordance with law.

This statement removes the voice from the order impounding the passport and it
can no longer be assailed on the ground that it does not comply with the audi
alteram partem rule or is. not in accord with the procedure prescribed by the
Passports Act, 1967.

Is Section 10(3) (c) violative of Article 14 ? That takes us to the next
question whether section 10(3) (c) is violative of any of the fundamental
rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. Only two articles of the
Constitution are relied upon for this purpose and they are Articles 14 and 19
(1) (a) and (g). We will first dispose of the challenge based on Article 14 as
it lies in a very narrow compass. The argument tinder this head of challenge,
was that 684 section 10(3) (c) confers unguided and unfettered power on the
Passport Authority to impound a passport and hence it is violative of the
equality clause contained in Article 14. It was conceded that under section 10
(3) (c) the power to impound a passport can be exercised only upon one or more
of the, stated grounds, but the complaint was that the ground of "interests of
the general public". was too vague and indefinite to afford any real guidance
to the Passport Authority and the Passport Authority could, without in any way
violating the terms of the section, impound the passport of one and not of
another, at its discretion. Moreover, it was said that when the order
impounding a passport is made by the Central Government, there is no appeal or
revision provided by the Statute and the decision of the Central Government
that it is in public interest to impound a passport is final and conclusive.
The discretion vested in the Passport Authority, and particularly in the
Central Government, is thus unfettered and unrestricted and this is plainly in
violation of Article 14. Now, the law is well settled that when a statute
vests unguided and unrestricted power in an authority to affect the rights of
a person without laying down any policy or principle which is to guide the
authority in exercise of this power, it would be affected by the vice of
discrimination since it would leave it open to the Authority to discriminate
between persons and things similarly situated. But here it is difficult to say
that the discretion conferred on the Passport Authority is arbitrary or
unfettered. There are four grounds set out in section 10(3) (c) which would
justify the making of an order impounding a passport. We are concerned only
with the last ground denoted by the words "in the interests of the general
public", for that is the ground which is attacked as vague and indefinite. We
fail to see how this ground can, by any stretch of argument, be characterised
as vague or undefined. The words "in the interests of the general public" have
a clearly well defined meaning and the courts have often been called upon to
decide whether a particular action is "in the interests of the general public"
or in "public interest" and no difficulty has been experienced by the Courts
in carrying out this exercise. These words are in fact borrowed ipsissima
verba from Article 19(5) and we think it would be nothing short of heresy to
accuse the constitution makers of vague and loose thinking. The legislature
performed a scissor and paste operation in lifting these words out of Article
19(5) and introducing them in section 10(3) (c) and if these words are not
vague and indefinite in Article 19(5), it is difficult to see bow they can be
condemned to be such when they occur in section 10(3) (c). How can section
10(3) (c) be said to incur any constitutional infirmity on account of these
words when they are no wider than the constitutional provision in Article
19(5) and adhere loyally to the verbal formula adopted In the Constitution ?
We are clearly of the view that sufficient guidelines are provided by the,
words "in the interests of the general public" and the power conferred on the
Passport Authority to impound a passport cannot be said to be unguided or
unfettered. Moreover, it must be remembered that the exercise of this power is
not made dependent on the subjective opinion of the Passport Authority as
regards the necessity of exercising it on one or more of the grounds stated in
the section, but the Passport Authority is required to record in writing a
brief statement of reasons for impounding the passport and, save in cer-

685

tain exceptional circumstances, to supply a copy of such statement to the
person affected, so that the person concerned can challenge the decision of
the Passport Authority in appeal and the appellate authority can examine
whether the reasons given by the Passport Authority are correct, and if so,
whether they justify the making of the order impounding the passport. It is
true that when the order impounding a passport is made by the Central
Government, there is no appeal against it, but it must be remembered that in
such a case the power is exercised by the Central Government itself and it can
safely be assumed that the Central Government will exercise the power in a
reasonable and responsible manner. When power is vested in a high authority
like the Central Government, abuse of power cannot be lightly assumed. And in
any event, if there is abuse of power, the arms of the court are long enough
to reach it and to strike it down. The power conferred on the Passport
Authority to impound a passport under section 10(3)

(c) cannot, therefore, be regarded as discriminatory and it does not fall foul
of Article 14. But every exercise of such power has to be tested in order to
determine whether it is arbitrary or within the guidelines provided in Section
10(3)

(c).

Conflicting approaches for locating the fundamental right violated Direct and
Inevitable effect test. We think it would be proper at this stage to consider
the approach to be adopted by the Court in adjudging the constitutionality of
a statute on the touchstone of fundamental rights. What is the test or
yardstick to be applied for determining whether a statute infringes a
particular fundamental right ? The law on this point has undergone radical
change since the days of A. K. Gopalan's case. That was the earliest' decision
of this Court on the subject, following almost immediately upon the
commencement of the Constitution. The argument which arose for consideration
in this case was that the preventive detention order results in the detention
of the applicant in a cell and hence it contravenes the fundamental rights
guaranteed under clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of Article 19(1).
This argument was negatived by Kania, C. J., who pointed out that : "The true
approach is only to consider the directness of the legislation and not what
will be the result of the detention, otherwise valid, on the mode of the
detenu's life-Any other construction put on the article-will be unreasonable".
These observations were quoted with approval by Patanjali Sastri, J; speaking
on behalf of the majority in Ram Singh and Ors. v. State of Delhi(1). There,
the detention of the petitioner was ordered with a view, to preventing him
from making. any speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and
the argument was that the order of detention was invalid as it infringed the
right of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)

(a). The Court took the view that the direct object of the order was
preventive detention and not-the infringement of the right of freedom of
speech and expression, which was merely consequential upon the detention of
the detenu and upheld the validity of the order. The decision in A. K.
Gopalan's case, followed by Ram Singh's case, gave rise to the theory that the
object and form of State action determine the extent of protection which may
be claimed (1) [1951]S.C.R.451.

686

by an individual and the validity of such action has to be judged by
considering whether it is "directly in respect of the subject covered by any
particular article of the Constitution or touches the said article only
incidentially or indirectly". The test to be applied for determining the
constitutional validity of State action with reference to fundamental rights
is : what is the object of the authority in taking the action : what is the
subject-matter of the action and to which fundamental right does it relate ?
This theory that "the extent of protection of important gua- rantees, such as
the liberty of person and right to property, depend upon the form and object
of the State action and not upon its direct operation upon the individual's
freedom" held away for a considerable time and was applied in Naresh Shridhar
Mirajkar & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.(1) to sustain an order made by
the High Court in a suit for defamation prohibiting the publication of the
evidence of a witness. This Court, after referring to the observation of
Kania, C.J., in A. K. Gopalan's case and noting that they were approved by the
Fill Court in Ram Singh's case, pointed out that the object of the impugned
order was to give protection to the witness in order to obtain true evidence
in the case with a view to do justice between the parties and it incidentally
it operated to prevent the petitioner from reporting the proceedings of the
court in the press, it could not be said to contravene Article 19(1) (a).

But it is interesting to note that despite the observations of Kania, C.J., in
A. K. Gopalan's case and the approval of these observations in Ram Singh's
case, there were two decisions given by this Court prior to Mirajkar's case,
which, seemed to deviate and strike, a different note. The first was the
decision in Express News Papers (P) Ltd. & Anr. V. The Union of India &
Ors.(2) where N. H. Bhagwati, J., speaking on behalf of the Court, referred to
the observations of Kania, C.J., in A. K. Gopalan's case and the decision in
Rain Singh's case, but ultimately formulated the test of direct and inevitable
effect for the purpose of ad- judging whether a statute offends a particular
fundamental right. The learned Judge pointed out that all the consequences
suggested on behalf of the petitioner's as flowing out of the Working
Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Act, 1955, namely, "the
tendency to curtail circulation and thereby narrow the scope of dissemination
of information, fetters on the petitioners' freedom to choose the means of
exercising the right, likelihood of the independence of the press being
undermined by having to seek government aid, the imposition of penalty on the
petitioners' right to choose the instruments for exercising the freedom or
compelling them to seek alternative media etc.", would be remote and depend
upon various factors which may or may not come into play. "Unless these were
the direct or inevitable consequences of the measures enacted in the impugned
Act", said the learned Judge, "it would not be possible to strike down the
legislation as having that effect and operation. A possible eventuality of
this type would not necessarily he the consequence which could be in the
contemplation of the Legislature while enacting a measure of this type for the
benefit of the (1) [1966] 3 S.C.R. 744.

(2) [1959] S.C.R. 12.

687

workmen concerned." Then again, the learned Judge observed the intention or
the proximate effect and operation of the Act was such as to bring it within
the mischief of Article 19(1) (a), it would certainly be liable to be struck
down. The real difficulty, however, in the way of the petitioners is that
neither the intention nor the effect and ,operation of the impugned Act is to
take away or abridge the right of freedom of speech and expression enjoyed by
the petitioners". Here we find the gern of the doctrine of direct and
inevitable effect, which necessarily must be effect intended by the
legislature, or in other words, 'what may conveniently and appropriately be
described as the doctrine of intended and real effect. So also in Sakal Papers
(P) Ltd. & Ors. v. The Union of India(1) while considering the constitutional
validity of the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956 and Daily Newspaper
(Price and Page) Order, 1960, this Court applied the test of direct and
immediate effect. This Court, relying upon the decision in Dwarkadas Shrinivas
v. The Sholapur & Weaving Co. Ltd.(2) pointed out that "it is the substance
and the practical result of the act of the State that should be considered
rather than its purely legal aspect" and "the correct ap- proach in_such cases
should be to enquire as to what in substance is the loss or injury caused to
the citizen and not merely what manner and method has been adopted by the
State in placing the restriction." Since "the direct and immediate effect of
the order" would be to restrain a newspaper from publishing any number of
pages for carrying its news and views, which it has a fundamental right under
Article 19 (1) (a) to do, unless it raises the selling price as provided in
the Schedule to the Order, it was held by this Court that the order was
violative of the right of the newspapers guaranteed by Article 19(1) (a). Here
again, the emphasis was on the direct and inevitable effect ,of the impugned
action of the State rather than on its object and form or subject-matter.

However, it was only R. C. Cooper's case that the doctrine that the ,object
and form of the State action alone determine the extent of protection that may
be claimed by an individual and that the effect of the State action on the
fundamental right of the individual is irrelevant, was finally rejected. It
may be pointed out that this doctrine is in sub-stance and reality nothing
else than the test of pith and substance which is applied for determining the
constitutionality of legislation where there is conflict of legislative powers
conferred on Federal and State Legis- latures with reference to legislative
Lists. The question which is asked in such cases is : what is the pith and
substance of the legislations; if it "is within the express powers, then it is
not invalidated if incidentally it effects matters which are outside the
authorised field". Here also, ,on the application of this doctrine, the
question that is required to be considered is : what is the pith and substance
of the action of the State, ,or in other words, what is its true nature and
character; if it is in respect of the subject covered by any particular
fundamental right, its validity must be judged only by reference to that
fundamental right and it is immaterial that it incidentally affects another
fundamental right.

Mathew, J., in his dissenting judgment in Bennett Coleman & Co. & Ors. v.
Union of India & Ors.(1) recognised the likeness of this doctrine to the pith
and substance test and pointed out that "the pith and substance test, although
not strictly appropriate, might serve a useful purpose" in determining whether
the State action infringes a particular fundamental right. But in R. C.
Cooper's case, which was a decision given by the Full Court consisting of
eleven judges, this doctrine was thrown overboard and it was pointed out by
Shah, J.,, speaking on half of the majority :

> "-it is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right
> of a citizen, nor the form of action that determines the protection he can
> claim; it is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which
> attract the jurisdiction of the Court to grant relief. If this be the true
> view, and we think it is, in determining the impact of State action upon
> constitutional guarantees which are fundamental, it follows that the extent
> of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined not by
> the object of the Legislature nor by the form of the action , but by its
> direct operation upon the individual's rights.

> " we are of the view that the theory that the object and form of the State
> action determine the extent of protection which the aggrieved party may
> claim is not consistent with the constitutional scheme-"

> "In our judgment, the assumption in A. K. Gopalan's case; that certain
> articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and in
> determining whether there is infringement of the individual's guaranteed
> rights, the object and the form of the State action alone need be
> considered, and effect of the laws on fundamental rights of the indivi-
> duals in general will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct."

The decision in R. C. Cooper's case thus overturned the view taken in A. K.
Gopalan's case and, as pointed out by Ray, J., speaking on behalf of the
majority in, Bennett Coleman's case,it laid down two interrelated
propositions, namely, "First, it is not the object of the authority making the
law impairing the right of the citizen nor the form of action that determines
the invasion of the right. Secondly,, it is the effect of the law and the
action upon the right which attracts the jurisdiction of the Court to grant
relief. The direct operation of the Act upon the rights forms the real test."

The decision in Bennett Coleman's case, followed upon R. C. Cooper's case and
it is' an important and significant decision, since it elaborated and applied
the thesis laid down in R. C. Cooper's case. The State action which was
impugned in Bennett Coleman's case was newsprint (1) [1973] 2S.C.R.757.

689

policy which inter alia imposed a maximum limit of ten pages for every
newspaper but without permitting the newspaper to increase the number of pages
by reducing circulation to meet its requirement even within the admissible
quota. These restrictions were, said to be violative of the right of free
speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) since their direct
and inevitable consequence was to, limit the number of pages which could be
published by a newspaper to ten. The argument of the Government was that the,
object of the newsprint policy was rationing and equitable distribution of
imported newsprint which was scarce commodity and not abridgement of freedom
of speech and expression. The subject-matter of the import policy was
"rationing of imported commodity and equitable distribution of newsprint" and
the newsprint policy did not directly and immediately deal with the right
mentioned in Article 19(1)

(a) and hence there was no violation of that Article. This argument of the
Government was negatived by the majority in the following words :

> "Mr. Palkhivala said that the tests of pith and substance of the subject
> matter and of direct and of incidental effect of the legislation are
> relevant to questions of legislative competence but they are irrelevant to
> the question of infringement of fundamental rights. In our view this is a
> sound and correct approach to interpretation of legislative measures and
> State action in relation to fundamental rights. The true test is whether the
> effect of the impugned action is to take away or abridge fundamental rights.
> If it be assumed that the direct object of the law or action has to be
> direct abridgement of the right of free speech by the impugned law or action
> it is to be related to the directness of effect and not to the directness of
> the, subject matter of the impeached law or action. The action may have a
> direct effect on a fundamental right although its direct subject matter may
> be different. A law dealing directly with the Defence of India or defamation
> may yet have a direct effect on the freedom of speech. Article 19(2) could
> not have such law if the restriction is unreasonable even if it is related
> to matters mentioned therein. Therefore, the word "direct" would go to the
> quality or character of the effect and not to the subject matter. The object

> object of the newspaper restrictions has nothing to do with the availability
> of newsprint or foreign exchange because these restrictions come into
> operation after the grant of quota. Therefore the restrictions are to
> control the number of pages or circulation of dailies or newspapers. These
> restrictions are clearly outside the ambit of Article 19(2) of the
> Constitution. It, therefore, confirms that the right of freedom of speech
> and expression is abridged by these restrictions".

The majority took the view that it was not the object of the newsprint policy
or its subject matter which was determinative but its direct consequence or
effect upon the rights of the newspapers and since "the effect 690 and
consequence of the impugned policy upon the newspapers" was direct control and
restriction of growth and circulation of newspapers, the newsprint policy
infringed freedom of speech and expression and was hence violative of Article
19(1) (a). The pith and substance theory was thus negatived in the clearest
terms and the test applied was as to what is the direct and inevitable
consequence or effect of the impugned State action on the fundamental right of
the petitioner. It is possible that in a given case the pith and substance of
the State action may deal with a particular fundamental right but its direct
and inevitable effect may be on another fundamental right and in that case,
the State action would have to meet the challenge of the latter fundamental
right. The pith and substance doctrine looks only at the object and subject-
matter of the State action, but in testing the validity of the State action
with reference to fundamental rights, what the Court must consider is the
direct and inevitable consequence of the State action. Otherwise, the
protection of the fundamental rights would be subtly but surely eroded.

It may be recalled that the test formulated in R. C. Cooper's case merely
refers to 'direct operation' or 'direct consequence and effect' of the State
action on the fundamental right of the petitioner and does not use the word
'inevitable' in this connection. But there can be no doubt, on a reading of
the relevant observations of Shah, J., that such was the test really intended
to be laid down by the Court in that case. If the test were merely of direct
or indirect effect, it would be a openended concept and in the absence of
operational criteria for judging 'directness', it would give the Court an
unquantifiable discretion to decide whether in a given case a consequence or
effect is direct or not. Some other concept-vehicle would be needed to
quantify the extent of directness or indirectness in order to apply the test.
And that is sup- plied by the criterion of 'inevitable' consequence or effect
adumbrated in the Express Newspaper's case. This criterion helps to quantify
the extent of directness necessary to constitute infringement of a fundamental
right is direct and inevitable, then a fortiori it must be presumed to have
been intended by the authority taking the action and hence this doctrine of
direct and inevitable effect has been described by some jurists as the
doctrine of intended and real effect. This is the test which must be applied
for the purpose of determining whether section 10(3) (c) or the impugned order
made under it is violative of Art. 19(1) (a) or (g). Is Section 10(3) (c)
violative of Article 19 (1) (a) or (g) ?

We may now examine the challenge based on Article 19(1) (a) in the light of
this background. Article 19(1) (a) enshrines one of the most cherished
freedoms in a democracy, namely, freedom of speech and expression. The
petitioner, being a citizen, has undoubtedly this freedom guaranteed to her,
but the question is whether section 10(3) (c) or the impugned Order
unconstitutionally takes away or abridges this freedom. Now, prima facie, the
right, which is sought to-be restricted by section 10(3) (c) and the impugned
Order, is the right to go abroad and that is not named as a fundamental right
or included in so many words in Article 19(1) (a), but the argument of the
petitioner was that the right to go abroad is an integral part of the freedom
of 691 speech and expression and whenever State action, be it law or executive
fiat, restricts or interferes with the right to go abroad, it necessarily
involves curtailment of freedom of speech and expression, and is, therefore
required to meet the challenge of Article 19 (1) (a). This argument was sought
to be answered by the Union of India by a two-fold contention. The first limb
of the contention was that the right to go abroad could not possibly be
comprehended within freedom of speech and expression, because the right of
free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) was exercisable
only within the territory of India and the guarantee of its exercise did not
extend outside the, country and hence State action restricting or preventing
exercise of the right to go abroad could not be said to be violative of
freedom of speech and expression and be liable to be condemned as invalid on
that account. The second limb of the contention went a little further and
challenged the very premise on which the argument of the petitioner was based
and under this limb, the argument put forward was that the right to go abroad
was not integrally connected with the freedom of speech and expression, nor
did it partake of the same basic nature and character and hence it was not
included in the tight of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article
19(1) (a') and imposition of restriction on it did not involve violation of
that Article. These were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the
parties and we shall now proceed to consider them. (A) Is Freedom of speech
and expression confined to the Territory of India ?

The first question that arises for consideration on these contentions is as to
what is the scope and ambit of the right of free speech and expression
conferred under Article 19(1) (a). Has it any geographical limitations ? Is
its exercise guaranteed only within the territory of India or does it also
extend outside ? The Union of India contended that it was a basic postulate of
the Constitution that the fundamental rights guaranteed by it were available
only within the territory of India, for it could never have been the intention
of the constitution-makers to confer rights which the authority of the State
could not enforce. The argument was stressed in the form of an interrogation;
how could the fundamental rights be intended to be operative outside the
territory of India when their exercise in foreign territory could not be
protected by the State ? Were the fundamental rights intended to be mere
platitudes. in so far as territory outside India is concerned ? What was the
object of conferring the guarantee of fundamental rights outside the territory
of India, if it could not be carried out by- the State ? This argument,
plausible though it may seem at first blush, is, on closer scrutiny, unsound
and must be rejected. When the constitution-makers enacted Part III dealing
with fundamental rights, they inscribed in the Constitution certain basic
rights which inhere in every human being and which are essential for
unfoldment and development of his full personality. These rights represent the
basic values of a civilised society and the constitution-makers declared that
they shall be given a place of pride in the Constitution and elevated to the
status of fundamental rights.

692

The long years of the freedom struggle inspired by the dynamic spiritualism of
Mahatma Gandhi and in fact the entire cultural and spiritual history of India
formed, the background against which these rights were enacted and
consequently, these rights were, conceived by the constitu- tion-makers not in
a narrow limited sense but in their widest sweep, for the aim and objective
was to build a new social order where man will not be a mere plaything in the
hands of the State or a few privileged persons but there will be full scope
and opportunity for him to achieve the maximum development of his personality
and the dignity of the individual will be fully assured. The constitution-
makers recognised the spiritual dimension of man and they were conscious that
he is an embodiment of divinity, what the great Upnishadnic verse describes as
"the children of immortality" and his mission in life is to realise the
ultimate truth. This obviously he cannot achieve unless he has certain basic
freedoms, such as freedom of thought, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech
and expression, personal liberty to move where he likes and so on and so
forth. It was this vast conception of man in society and universe that
animated the formulation of fundamental rights and it is difficult to believe
that when the constitution- makers, declared these rights, they intended to
confine them only within the territory of India. Take for example, freedom of
speech and expression. Could it have been intended by the constitution-makers
that a citizen should hive this freedom in India but not outside ? Freedom of
speech and expression carries with it the right to gather information as also,
to speak and express oneself at home and abroad and to, exchange thoughts and
ideas with others not only in India but also outside. On what principle of
construction and for what reason can this freedom be confined geographically
within the limits of India ? The constitution-makers have not chosen to limit
the extent of this freedom by adding the words "in the territory of India" at
the end of Article 19(1) (a). They have deliberately refrained from using any
words of limitation. Then, are we going to supply these words and narrow down
the scope and ambit of a highly cherished fundamental right ? Let us not
forget that what we are expounding is a constitution and what we are called
upon to interpret is a provision conferring a, fundamental right. Shall we
expand its reach and ambit or curtail it ? Shall we ignore the high and noble
purpose of Part III conferring fundamental rights ? Would we not be
stultifying the fundamental right of free speech and expression by restricting
it by territorial limitation. Moreover, it may be noted that only a short
while before the Constitution was brought into force and whilst the
constitutional debate was still going on, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10th
December, 1948 and most of the fundamental rights which we find included in
Part III were recognised and adopted by the United Nations as the inalienable
rights of man in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration declared that "every one, has a right to freedom of
opinion and expression, this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and import information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers". (emphasis supplied). This was the glorious
declaration of the: fundamental freedom of speech and expression noble in
conception and universal in scope- which was 693 before them when the
constitution-makers enacted Article 19 (1) (a). We have, therefore, no doubt
that freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1) (a) is
exercisable not only in India but outside. It is true that the right of free
speech and expression enshrined in Article 19 (1) (a) can be enforced only if
it sought to be violated by any action of the State and since State action
cannot have any extra territorial operation, except perhaps incidentally in
case of Parliamentary legislation, it is only violation within the territory
of India that can be complained of by an aggrieved person. But that does not
mean that the right of free speech and expression is exercisable only in India
and not outside. State action taken within the territory of India can prevent
or restrict exercise of freedom of speech and expression outside India. What
Article 19(1) (a) does is to declare freedom of speech and expression as a
fundamental right and to protect it against State action. The State cannot by
any legislative or executive, action interfere with the exercise of this
right, except in so far as permissible under Article 19(2). The State action
would necessarily be taken in India but it may impair or restrict the exercise
of this right elsewhere. Take for example a case where a journalist is
prevented by a law or an executive order from sending his despatch abroad. The
law or the ,executive order would operate on the, journalist in India but what
it would prevent him from doing is to exercise his freedom of speech and
expression abroad. Today in the modern world with vastly developed science and
technology and highly improved and sophisticated means of communication, a
person may be able to exercise freedom of speech and expression abroad by
doing something within the country and if this is published or restricted, his
freedom of speech and expression would certainly be impaired and Article 19
(1) (a) violated. Therefore, merely because State action is restricted to the
territory of India, it does not necessarily follow that the right of free
speech and expression is also limited in its operation to the territory of
India and does not extend outside.

This thesis can also be substantiated by looking at the question from a
slightly different point of view. It is obvious that the right of free speech
and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) can be subjected to
restriction permissible under Article 19(2). Such restric- tion, imposed by a
statute or an order made under it, if within the limits provided in Article
19(2), would clearly bind the citizen not only when he is within the country
but also when he travels outside. Take for example a case where, either under
the Passports Act, 1967 ,or as a condition in the Passport issued under it, an
arbitrary, unreasonable and wholly unjustifiable restriction is placed upon
the citizen that he may go abroad, but he should not make any speech there.
This would plainly be a restriction which would interfere with his freedom of
speech and expression outside the country, for, if valid, it would bind him
wherever he may go. He would be entitled to say that such a restriction
imposed by State action is impermissible under Article 19(2) and is
accordingly void as being violative of Article 19(1 )(a) 6-119 SCI/78 694 It
would thus seem clear that freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under
Article 19(1) (a) is exercisable not only inside the country, but also
outside. There is also another consideration which leads to the same
conclusion. The right to go abroad is, as held in Satwant Singh Sawhney's
case, included in personal liberty' within the meaning of Article 21 and is
thus a fundamental right protected by that Article. When the State issues a
passport and grants endorsement for one country, but refuses for another, the
person concerned can certainly go out of India but he is prevented from going
to the country for which the endorsement is refused and his right to go to
that country is taken away. This cannot be done by the State under Article 21
unless there is a law authorising the State to do so and the action is taken
in accordance with the procedure prescribed by such law. The right to, go
abroad, and in particular to a specified country, is clearly right to personal
liberty exercisable outs de India and yet it has been held in Satwant Singh
Sawhney's case to be a fundamental right protected by Article 21. This clearly
shows that there is no underlying principle in the Constitution which limits
the fundamental rights in their operation to the territory of India. If a
fundamental right under Article 21 can be exercisable outside India, why can
freedom of speech and expression conferred under Article 19(1) (a) be not so
exercisable ?

This view which we are taking is completely in accord with the thinking on the
subject in the United States. There the preponderance of opinion is that the,
protection of the Bill of Rights is available to United States citizens even
in foreign countries. Vide Best v. United States(1). There is an interesting
article on "The Constitutional Right to Travel" in 1956 Columbia Law Review
where Leonard B. Boudin writes :

> "The final objection to limitation upon the right to travel in that they
> interfere with the, individual's freedom of expression. Travel itself is
> such a freedom in the view of one scholarly jurist. But we need not go that
> far; it is enoughthat the freedom of speech includes the right of Americans

> are no geographical limitations to the Bill of Rights. A Government that
> sets up barriers to its citizens' freedom of expression in any country in

These observations were quoted with approval by Hegde, J., (as he then was)
speaking on behalf of a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Dr. S.
S. Sadashiva Rao v. Union of India(2) and the learned Judge there pointed out
that "these observations apply in equal force to the conditions prevailing in
this country". it is obvious, therefore, that there are no geographical
limitations to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed Under Article 19(1)
(a) and this freedom is exercisable not only in India but also outside and if

action sets up barriers to its citizen's freedom of expression in any country
in the world, it would violate Article 19(1) (a) as much as if ,it inhibited
such expression within the country. This conclusion would on a parity of
reasoning apply equally in relation to the fundamental right to practice any
profession or to carry any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under
Article 19(1)

(g).

(B) Is the right to go abroad covered by Article 19 (1) (a) or (g) ?

That takes us to the next question arising out of the second limb of the
contention of the Government. Is the right to go abroad an essential part of
freedom of speech and expression so that whenever there is violation of the
former, there is impairment of the latter involving infraction of Article 19
(1) (a)? The argument of the petitioner was that while it is true that the
right to go abroad is not expressly included as a fundamental right in any of
the clauses of Article 19(1), its existence is necessary in order to make the
express freedoms mentioned in Article 19(1) meaningful and effective. The
right of free speech and expression can have meaningful content and its
exercise can be effective only if the right to travel abroad is ensured and
without it, freedom of speech and expression would be limited by geographical
constraints. The impounding of the passport of a person with a view to
preventing him from going abroad to communicate his ideas or share his
thoughts and views with others or to express himself through song or dance or
other forms and media of expression is direct interference with freedom of
speech and expression. It is clear, so ran the argument, that in a complex and
developing society, where fast modes of transport and communication have
narrowed down distances and brought people living in different parts of the
world together, the right to associate with like minded persons in other parts
of the globe, for the purpose of advancing social, political or other ideas
and policies is indispensable and that is part of freedom of speech and
expression which cannot be effectively implemented without the right to go
abroad. The right to go abroad, it was said, is a peripheral right emanating
from the right to freedom of speech and expression and is, therefore, covered
by Article 19(1) (a). This argument of the petitioner was sought to be
supported by reference to some recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States. We shall examine these decisions a little later, but let us
first consider the question on principle.

We may begin the discussion of this question by first considering the nature
and significance of the right to go abroad. It cannot be disputed that there
must exist a basically free sphere for man, resulting from the nature and
dignity of the human being as the bearer of the highest spiritual and moral
values. This basic freedom of the human being is expressed at various levels
and is reflected in various basic rights. Freedom to go abroad is one of such
rights, for the nature of man is a free agent necessarily involves free
movement on his part. There, can be no doubt that if the purpose and the sense
of the State is to protect personality and its development, as indeed it
should be of any liberal democratic State, freedom to go abroad must be given
its due place amongst the basic rights. This right is an important basic 696
human right for it nourishes independent and self- determining creative
character of the individual, not only by extending his freedoms of action, but
also by extending the scope of his experience. It is a right which gives
intellectual and creative workers in particular the opportu- nity of extending
their spiritual and intellectual horizon through study at foreign
universities, through contact with foreign colleagues and through
participation in discussions and conferences. The right also extends to
private life : marriage, family and friendship are humanities which can be
rarely affected through refusal of freedom to go abroad and clearly show that
this freedom is a genuine human right. Moreover, this freedom would be highly
valuable right where man finds himself obliged to flee (a) because he is
unable to serve his God as he wished at the previous place of residence, (b)
because his personal freedom is threatened for reasons which do not constitute
a crime in the usual meaning of the word and many were such cases during the
emergency, or (c) because his life is threatened either for religious or
political reasons or through the threat to the maintenance of minimum standard
of living compatible with human dignity. These, reasons suggest that freedom
to go abroad incorporates the important function of an ultimum refunium
libertatis when other basic freedoms are refused. To, quote the words of Mr.
Justice Douglas in Kent v. Dulles(1) freedom to go abroad has much social
value and represents a basic human right of great significance. It is in fact
incorporated as an inalienable human right in Article 13 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. But it is not specifically named as a fundamental
right in Article 19(1). Does it mean that on that account it cannot be a
fundamental right covered by Article 19(1) ? Now, it may be pointed out at the
outset that it is not our view that a right which is not specifically
mentioned by name can never be a fundamental right within the meaning of
Article 19(1). It is possible that a right does not find express mention in
any clause of Article 19(1) and yet it may be covered by some clause of that
Article. Take for example, by way of illustration, freedom of press. It is a
most cherished and valued freedom in a democracy : indeed democracy cannot
survive without a free press. Democracy is based essentially on free debate
and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of Governmental action in
a democratic set up. If democracy means government of the people by the
people, it is obvious that every citizen must be entitled to participate in
the democratic process and in order to enable him to intelligently exercise
his right of making a choice, free and general discussion of public matters is
absolutely essential. Manifestly, free debate and open discussion, in the most
comprehensive sense, is not possible unless there is a free and independent
press. Indeed the true measure of the health and vigour of a democracy is
always to be found in its press. Look at its newspapers-do they reflect
diversity of opinions and views, do they contain expression of dissent and
criticism against governmental policies and actions, or do they obsequiously
sing the praises of the government or lionize or deify the ruler. The
newspapers are the index of the true character of the Government-whether if is
democratic or authoritarian. It was (1) 357 U.S. 11 6 : 2 L. ed. 2d 1204.

Mr. Justice Potter Stewart who said : "Without an informed and free press,
there cannot be an enlightened people". Thus freedom of the press constitutes
one of the pillars of democracy and indeed lies at the foundation of
democratic Organisation and yet it is not enumerated in so many terms as a
fundamental right in Article 19(1), though there is a view held by some
constitutional jurists that this freedom is too basic and fundamental not to
receive express mention in Part III of the Constitution. But it has been held
by this Court in several decisions, of which we may mention only three,
namely, Express Newspapers' case, Sakal Newspapers case and Bennett Coleman &
Co's case, that freedom of the press is part of the right of free speech and
expression and is covered by Article 19 (1) (a). The, reason is that freedom
of the press is nothing but an aspect of freedom of speech and expression. It
partakes of the same basic nature and character and is indeed an integral part
of free speech and expression and perhaps it would not be incorrect to say
that it is the same right applicable in relation to the press. So also,
freedom of circulation is necessarily involved in freedom of speech and
expression and is part of it and hence enjoys the protection of Article 19(1)
(a). Vide Ramesh Thappar v. State of Madras(1). Similarly, the right to paint
or sing or dance or to write poetry or literature is also covered by Article
19(1) (a), because the common basic characteristic in all these activities is
freedom of speech and expression, or to put it differently, each of these
activities is an exercise of freedom of speech and expression. It would thus
be seen that even if a right is not specifically named in Article 19(1), it
may still be a fundamental right covered by some clause of that Article, if it
is an integral part of a named fundamental right or partakes of the same basic
nature and character as that fundamental right. It is not enough that a right
claimed by the petitioner flows or emanates from a named fwidamental right or
that its existence is necessary in order to make the exercise of the named
fundamental right meaningful and effective. Every activity which facilitates
the exercise of a named fundamental right is not necessarily comprehended in
that fundamental right nor can it be regarded as such merely because it may
not be possible, otherwise to effectively exercise, that fundamental right.
The contrary construction would lead to incongruous results and the entire
scheme of Article 19(1) which confers different rights and sanctions different
restrictions according to different standards depending upon. the nature, of
the right will be upset. What is necessary to be seen is, and that is the test
which must be applied, whether the right claimed by the petitioner is an
integral part of a named fundamental right or partakes of the same basic
nature and character as the named fundamental right so that the exercise of
such right is in reality and substance nothing but an instance of the exercise
of the named fundamental right. If this be the correct test, as we apprehend
it is. the right to, go abroad cannot in all circumstances be regarded as
included in freedom of speech and expression. Mr. Justice Douglas said in Kent
v. Dulles that "freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and
inside frontiers as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad. like
travel within the country, ay be necessary for livelihood. It may be as close
to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, (1) [1950]
S.C.R. 594.

698

or wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our Scheme of values." And
what the learned Judge, said in regard to freedom of movement in his country
holds good in our country as well. Freedom of movement has been a part of our
ancient tradition which always upheld the dignity of man and saw in him the
embodiment of the Divine. The Vedic seers knew no limitations either in the
locomotion of the human body or in the flight of the soul to higher planes of
consciousness. Even in the post-Upnishadic period, followed by the Buddhistic
era and the early centuries after Christ, the people of this country went to
foreign lands in pursuit of trade and business or in search of knowledge or
with a view to shedding on others the light of knowledge imparted to them by
their ancient sages and seers. India expanded outside her borders: her ships
crossed the ocean and the fine superfluity of her wealth brimmed over to the
East as well as to the West. He cultural messengers and envoys spread her arts
and epics in South East Asia and her religious conquered China and Japan and
other Far Eastern countries and spread westward as far as Palestine and
Alexendria. Even at the end of the last and the beginning of the present
century, our people sailed across the seas to settle down in the African
countries. Freedom of movement at home and abroad is a part of our heritage
and, as already pointed out, it is a highly cherished right essential to the
growth and development of the human personality and its importance cannot be
over emphasised. But it cannot be said to be part of the right of free speech
and expression. It is not of the same basic nature and character as freedom of
speech and expression. When a person goes abroad, he may do so for a variety
of reasons and it may not necessarily and always be for exercise of freedom of
speech and expression. Every travel abroad is not an exercise of right of free
speech and expression and it would not be correct to say that whenever there
is a restriction on the right to go abroad, ex necessitae it involves
violation of freedom of speech and expression. It is no doubt true that going
abroad may be necessary in a given case for exercise of freedom of speech and
expression, but that does not make it an integral part of the right of free
speech and expression. Every activity that may be necessary for exercise of
freedom of speech and expression or that may facilitate such exercise or make
it meaningful and effective cannot be elevated to the status of a fundamental
right as if it were part of the fundamental right of free speech and
expression. Otherwise, practically every activity would become part of some
fundamental right or the other and. the object of making certain rights only
as fundamental rights with different permissible restrictions would be
frustrated.

The petitioner, however, placed very strong reliance on certain decisions of
the United States Supreme Court. The first was the decision in Kent v. Dulles
(supra). The Supreme Court laid down in this case that the right to travel is
guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and held that the denial of passport by the
Secretary of State was invalid because the Congress had not, under the
Passport Act, 1926, authorised the Secretary of State to refuse passport on
the ground of association with the communist party and refusal to file an
affidavit relating to that affiliation and such legislation was necessary
before the Secretary of 699 State could refuse passport on those grounds. This
decision was not concerned with the validity of any legislation regulating
issue of passports nor did it recognise the right to travel as founded on the
first Amendment which protects freedom of speech, petition and assembly. We
fail to see how this decision can be of any, help to the petitioner. The
second decision on which reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner was
Apthekar v. Secretary of State(1). The question Which arose for determination
in this case related to the constitutional validity 'of section 6 of the
Subversive Activities Control Act, 1950. This section prohibited the use of
passports by communists following a final registration order by the Subversive
Activities Control Board under section 7 and following the mandate of this
section, the State Department revoked the existing passports of the
appellants. After exhausting all administrative remedies, the appellants sued
for declarative and injunctive relief before the District Court which upheld
the validity of the section. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the
judgment by a majority of six against three, and held the section to be
invalid. The Supreme Court noted first that the right to travel abroad is an
important aspect of the citizens' liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment and section 6 substantially restricts that right and
then proceeded to apply the strict standard of judicial review which it had
till then applied only in cases involving the socalled preferred freedoms of
the first Amendment, namely, that "a governmental purpose-may not be achieved
by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of
protected freedoms". The Supreme Court found on application of this test that
the section was "overly broad and unconstitutional on its face" since it
omitted any requirement that the individual should have knowledge of the
organisational purpose to establish a communist totaliatarian dictatorship and
it made no attempt to relate the restriction on travel to the individual's
purpose of the trip or to the scurity-sensitivity of the area to be visited.
This decision again has no relevance to the present argument except for one
observation made by the Court that "freedom of travel is a constitutional
liberty closely related to rights of free speech and association". But this
observation also cannot help because the right to foreign travel was held to
be a right arising not out of the first Amendment but inferentially out of the
liberty guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment and this observation was meant only
to support the "tension of the strict First Amendment test to a case involving
the right to go abroad. The last decision cited by the petitioner Was Zemel .
v. Rusk 2) This case raised the question whether the Secretary of State was
statutorily authorised to refuse to validate the passports of United States
citizens for travel to Cuba and if so, whether the exercise of such authority
was constitutionally permissible. The Court, by a majority of six against
three, held that the ban on travel to Cuba was authorised by the broad
language of the Passport Act, 1926 and that such a restriction was
constitutional. Chief Justice Warren speaking on behalf of (1) 378 U. S. 500
:12 L. ed. 2d 992.

(2) 381 U. S. 1 : 14 L. ed. 2d 179.

700

the majority observed that having regard to administrative practice both
before and after 1926, area restrictions were statutorily authorised and that
necessitated consideration of Zemel's constitutional objections. The majority
took the view that freedom of movement was a right protected by the 'liberty'
clause of the Fifth Amendment and that the Secretary of State was justified in
attempting to avoid serious international incidents by restricting travel to
Cuba and summarily rejected Zemel's contention that the passport denial
infringed his First Amendment rights by preventing him from gathering first
band knowledge about Cuban situation. Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary
of State were distinguished on the, ground that "the refusal to, validate
appellant's passport does not result from any expression or association on his
part : appellant is not being forced to choose between membership of an
Organisation and freedom to travel". Justices, Douglas, Goldberg and Black
dissented in separate opinions. Since reliance was placed only on the opinion
of Justice Douglas, we may confine our attention to that opinion. Justice
Douglas followed the approach employed in Kent v. Dulles and, refused to
interpret the, Pass.port Act, 1926 as permitting the Secretary of State to
restrict travel to Cuba. While doing so, the learned Judge stressed the
relationship of the right to travel to First Amendment rights. He pointed out
: "The right to know, to converse with others, to consult with them, to
observe social, physical, political and other phenomena abroad as well as at
home gives meaning and substance to freedom of expression and freedom of the
press. Without these contacts First Amendment rights suffer", and added that
freedom to travel abroad is a right "peripheral to the enjoyment of the First
Amendment guarantees". He concluded by observing that "the right to travel is
at the periphery of the First Amendment" and therefore "restrictions on the
right to travel in times of peace should be so particularised that a First
Amendment right is not thereby precluded". Now, obviously, the majority
decision is of- no help to the petitioner. The majority rightly pointed out
that in Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary of State there was direct
interference with freedom of association by refusal to validate the passport,
since the appellant was required to give up membership of the Organisation if
he wanted validation of the passport. Such was not the case in zemel v. Rusk
and that is why, said the majority it was not a First Amendment right which
was involved. It appeared clearly to be the view of the, majority that if the
denial of passport directly affects a First Amendment right such as freedom of
expression or association as in Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary of
State, it would be constitutionally invalid. The majority did not accept the
contention that the right to travel for gathering information is in itself a
First Amendment right. Justice Douglas also did not regard the right to travel
abroad as a First Amendment right but held that it is peripheral to the
enjoyment of First Amendment guarantees because it gives meaning and substance
to the First Amendment rights and without it, these rights would suffer. That
is why he observed towards the end that restrictions on the right to travel
should be so particularised that a First Amendment right is not precluded or
in other words there is no direct infringement of a First Amendment right. If
there is, the restrictions would be constitutionally invalid, but not
otherwise. It is clear that Justice Douglas never 701 meant to lay down that a
right which is at the periphery of the First right under the First Amendment.
The learned Judge, did not hold the right to travel abroad to be a First
Amendment right. Both according to the majority as also Justice Douglas, the
question to be asked in each case is : is the restriction on the right to
travel such that it directly interferes with a First Amendment right. And that
is the same test which is applied by this Court in determining infringement of
a fundamental right. We cannot, therefore, accept the theory that a peripheral
or concomitant right which facilitates the exercise of a named fundamental
right or gives it meaning and substance or makes its exercise effective, is
itself a guaranteed right included within the named fundamental right. This
much is clear as a matter of plain construction, but apart from that, there is
a decision of this Court which clearly and in so many terms supports this
conclusion. That is the decision in All India Bank Employees' Association v.
National Industrial Tribunal(1). The legislation which was challenged in that
case was section 34A of the Banking Companies Act and it was assailed as
violative of Article 19(1)(c). The effect of section 34A was that no tribunal
could compel the production and inspection of any books of account or other
documents or require a bank to furnish or disclose any statement or
information if the Banking Company claimed such document or statement or
information to be of a confidential nature relating to secret reserves or to
provi- sion for bad and doubtful debts. If a dispute was pending and a
question was raised whether any amount from the reserves or other provisions
should be taken into account by a tribunal, the tribunal could refer the
matter to the Reserve, Bank of India whose certificate as to the amount which
could be taken into account, was made final and conclusive. Now, it was
conceded that section 34A did not prevent the workmen from forming unions or
place any impediments in their doing so, but it was contended that the right
to form association protected under Article 19 (1) (c) carried with it a
guarantee that the association shall effectively achieve the purpose for which
it was formed without interference by law except on grounds relevant to the
preservation of public order or morality set out in Article 19(4). In other
words, the argument was that the freedom to form unions carried with it the
concomitant right that such unions should be able to fulfil the object for
which they. were formed. This argument was negatived by a unanimous Bench of
this Court. The Court said that unions were not restricted to workmen, that
employers' unions may be formed in order to earn profit and that a guarantee
for the effective functioning of the unions would lead to the conclusion that
restrictions on their right to earn profit could be put only in the interests
of public order or morality. Such a construction would run basically counter
to the scheme of Article 19 and to the provisions of Article 19(1) (c) and
(6). The restrictions which could be imposed on the right to form an
association were limited to restrictions in the interest of public order and
morality. The restrictions which could be imposed on the right to carry on any
trade, business, profession or calling were reasonable res-

(1) [1962] 3 S.C.R. 269.

702

trictions in the public interest and if the guarantee for the effective
functioning of an association was a part of the right, then restrictions could
not be imposed in the public interest on the business of an association.
Again, an association of workmen may claim the right of collective bargaining
and the right to strike, yet the right to strike could not by implication be
treated as part of the right to form association, for, if it were so treated,
it would not be possible to put restrictions on that right in the public
interest as is done by the Industrial Disputes Act, which restrictions would
be permissible under Article 19(6), but not under Article 19(4). The Court,
therefore, held that the right to form unions guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (c)
does not carry with it a concomitant right that the unions so formed should be
able to achieve the purpose for which they are brought into existence, so that
any interference with such achievement by law would be unconstitutional unless
the same could be justified under Article 19(4). The right to go abroad
cannot, therefore, be regarded as included in freedom of speech and expression
guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) on the theory of peripheral or concomitant
right. This theory has been firmly rejected in the All India Bank Employees
Association's case and we cannot countenance any attempt to revive it, as that
would completely upset the scheme of Article 19(1) and to quote the words of
Rajagopala Ayyanger, J., speaking on behalf of the Court in All India Bank
Employees Association's case "by a series of ever expending concentric.
circles in the shape of rights concomitant to concomitant rights and so on,
lead to an almost grostesque result". So also, for the same reasons, the right
to go abroad cannot be treated as part of the, right to carry on trade,
business, profession or calling guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g). The right
to go abroad is clearly not a guaranteed right under any clause of Article
19(1 ) and section 10(3) (c) which authorises imposition of restrictions on
the right to go abroad by impounding of passport cannot be held to be void as
offending Article 19(1) (a) or (g), as its direct and inevitable impact is on
the right. to go abroad and not on the right of free speech and expression or
the. right to carry on trade, business profession or calling. Constitutional
requirement of an order under Section 10(3)

(c).

But that does not mean that an order made under section 10 (3) (c) may not
violate Article 19(1) (a) or (g). While discussing the constitutional validity
of the impugned order impounding the passport of the petitioner, we shall have
occasion to point out that even where a statutory provision empowering an
authority to take action is constitutionally valid, action taken under it may
offend a fundamental right and in that event, though the statutory provision
is valid, the action may be void. Therefore, even though section 10(3) (c) is
valid, the question would always remain whether an order made under it is
invalid as contravening a fundamental right. The direct and inevitable. effect
of an order impounding a passport may, in a given case, be to abridge or take
away freedom of speech and expression or the right to carry on a profession
and where such is the case, the order would be invalid, unless saved by
Article 19(2) or Article 19(6). Take for 703 example, a pilot with
international flying licence. International flying is his profession and if
his passport is impounded, it would directly interfere with his right to carry
on his profession and unless the order can be justified on the ground of
public interest under Article 19(6) it would be void as offending Article 19
(1) (g). Another example may be taken of an evangelist who has made it a
mission of his life to preach his faith to people all over the world and for
that purpose, set up institutions in different countries. If an order is made
impounding his passport, it would directly affect his freedom of speech and
expression and the challenge to the validity of the order under, Article 19
(1) (a) would be unanswerable unless it is saved by article 19(2). We have
taken these two examples only by way of illustration. There may be many such
cases where the restriction imposed is apparently only on the right to go
abroad but the direct and inevitable consequence is to interfere with the
freedom of speech and expression or the right to carry on a profession. A
musician may want to go abroad to sing, a dancer to dance, a visiting
professor to teach and a scholar to participate in a conference or seminar. If
in such a case his passport is denied or impounded, it would directly
interfere with his freedom of speech and expression. If a correspondent of a
newspaper is given a foreign assignment and he is refused passport or his
passport is impounded, it would be direct interference with his freedom to
carry on his profession. Examples can be multiplied, but the point of the
matter is that though the right to go abroad is not a fundamental right, the
denial of the right to go abroad may, in truth and in effect, restrict freedom
of speech and expression or freedom to carry on a profession so as to
contravene Article 19 (1) (a) or 19 (1)

(g). In such a case, refusal or impounding of passport would be invalid unless
it is justified under Article 19(2) or Article 19(6), as the case may be. Now,
passport can be impounded under section 10(3)(c) if the Passport Authority
deems it necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity
of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign
country or in the interests of the general public. The first three categories
are the same as those in Article 19 (2) and each of them, though separately
mentioned, is a species within the broad genus of "interests of the general
public". The expression "interests of the, general public" is a wide
expression which covers within its broad sweep all kinds of interests of the
general public including interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India,
security of India and friendly relations of India with foreign States.
Therefore, when an order is made under section 10(3) (c), which is in
conformity with the terms of that provision, it would be in the interests of
the general public and even if it restricts freedom to carry on a profession,
it would be protected by Article 19(6). But if an order made under section
10(3) (c) restricts freedom of speech and expression, it would not be enough
that it is made in the interests of the general public. It must fall within
the terms of Article 19(2) in order to earn the protection of that Article. If
it is made in the interests of the, sovereignty and integrity of India or, in
the interests of the security of India or in the interests of friendly
relations of. India with any foreign country, it would satisfy the requirement
of Article 19(2). But if it is made for any other interests of the, general
public save the interests of "public order, decency or morality", 704 it would
not enjoy the protection of Article 19(2). There can be no doubt that the
interests of public order, decency or morality are "interests of the general
public" and they would be covered by section 10(3) (c), but the expression
"interests of the general public" is, as already pointed out, a much wider
expression and, therefore, in order that an order made under section 10(3) (c)
restricting freedom of speech and expression, may not fall foul of Article
19(1)

(a), it is necessary that in relation to such order,, the expression
"interests of the general public" in section 10(3) (c) must be read down so as
to be limited to interests of public order, decency or morality. If an order
made under section 10(3) (c) restricts freedom of speech and expression, it
must be made not in the interests of the general public in a wider sense, but
in the interests of public order, decency or morality, apart from the other
three categories, namely, interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India,
the security of India and friendly relations of India with any foreign
country. If the order cannot be shown to have been made in the interests of
public order, decency or morality, it would not only contravene Article 19 (1)
(a), but would also be outside the authority conferred by section 10(3) (c).

Constitutional validity of the impugned Order: We may now consider, in the
light of this discussion, whether the impugned Order made by the Central
Government impounding the passport of the petitioner under section 10(3) (c)
suffers from any constitutional or legal infirmity. The first ground of attack
against the validity of the impugned Order was that it was made in
contravention of the rule of natural justice embodied in the maxim audi
alteram partem and was, therefore, null and void. We have already examined
this ground while discussing the constitutional validity of section 10(3) (c)
with reference to Article 21. and shown how the statement made by the learned
Attorney General on behalf of the Government of India has cured the impugned
Order of the vice of non- compliance with the audi alteram partem rule. It is
not necessary to say anything more about it. Another ground of challenge urged
on behalf of the, petitioner was that the impugned Order has the effect of
placing an unreasonable restriction on the right of free speech and expression
guaranteed to the petitioner under Article 19 (1) (a) as also on the right to
carry on the profession of a journalist conferred under Article; 19(1) (g), in
as much as if seeks to impound the passport of the petitioner idefinitely,
without any limit of time, on the mere likelihood of her being required in
connection with the Commission of Inquiry headed by Mr. Justice J. C. Shah. It
was not competent to the Central Government, it was argued, to express an
opinion as to whether the petitioner is likely to be required in connection
with the proceeding before the Commission of Inquiry. That would be a matter
within the judgment of the Commission of Inquiry and it would be entirely for
the Commission of Inquiry to decide whether or, not her presence is necessary
in the proceeding before it. The impugned Order impounding the passport of the
petitioner on the basis of a mere opinion by the central Government that the
petitioner is likely to be required in connection with the proceeding before
the Commission of Inquiry was, in the circumstances, clearly unreasonable and
hence violative of Article  705 19(1) (a) and (g). This ground of challenge
was vehemently pressed on behalf of the petitioner and supplemented on behalf
of Adil Sahariar who intervened at the hearing of the writ petition, but we do
not think there is any substance in it. It is true, and we must straiglitaway
concede it, that merely because a statutory provision empowering an authority
take action in specified circumstances is constitutionally valid as not being
in conflict with any fundamental rights, it does not give a carte blanche to
the authority to make any order it likes so long as it is within the
parameters laid down by the statutory provision. Every order made under a
statutory provision must not only be within the authority conferred by the
statutory provision, but must also stand the test of fundamental rights.
Parliament cannot be presumed to have intended to confer power on an authority
to act in contravention of fundamental rights. It is a basic constitutional
assumption underlying every statutory grant of power that the authority on
which the power is conferred should act constitutionally and not in violation
of any fundamental rights. This would seem to be elementary and no authority
is necessary in support of it, but if any were needed, it may be found in the
decision of this Court in Narendra Kumar & Ors. v. The Union of India &
Ors.(1). The question which arose in that case was whether clauses (3) and (4)
of the Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, 1958 made under section 3 of the
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 were constitutionally valid. The argument
urged on behalf of the petitioners was that these clauses imposed unreasonable
restrictions of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19(1) (f) and
(g) and in answer to this argument, apart from merits, a contention of a
prelimi- nary nature was advanced on behalf of the Government that "as the
petitioners have not challenged the validity of the Essential Commodities Act
and have admitted the power of the Central Government to make an order in
exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the Act, it is not open to
the Court to consider whether the law made by the Government in making the
non-ferrous metal control order-violates any of the fundamental rights under
the Constitution". It was urged that so long as the Order does not go beyond
the provisions in section 3 of the Act, it "must be held to be good and the
consideration of any question of infringement of fundamental rights under the
Constitution is wholly beside the point". This argument was characterised by
Das Gupta, J., speaking on behalf of the Court as "an extravagant argument"
and it was said that "such an extravagant argument has merely to be mentioned
to deserve rejection". The learned Judge proceeded to state the reasons for
rejecting this argument in the following words :

> "If there was any reason to think that section 3 of the Act confers on the
> Central Government power to do anything which is in conflict with the
> constitution-anything which violates any of the fundamental rights conferred
> by the Constitution, that fact alone would be sufficient and unassailable
> ground for holding that the section itself is void being ultra vires the

It would thus be clear that though the impugned Order may be within the terms
of section 10(3) (c), it must nevertheless not contravene any fundamental
rights and if it does, it would be void. Now, even if an order impounding a
passport is made in the interests of public order, decency or morality, the
restriction imposed by it may be so wide, excessive or disproportionate to the
mischief or evil sought to be averted that it may be considered unreasonable
and in that event, if the direct and inevitable consequence,, of the Order is
to abridge or take away freedom of speech and expression, it would be
violative of Article 19(1) (a) and would not be protected by Article 19(2) and
the same would be the position where the, order is in the interests of the'
general public but it impinges directly and inevitably on the freedom to carry
on a profession in which case it would contravene Article 19 (1) (g) without
being saved by the provision enacted in Article 19(6).

But we do not think that the impugned Order in the present case violates
either Article 19(1) (a) or Article 19(1) (g). What the impugned Order does is
to impound the passport of the petitioner and thereby prevent her from going
abroad and at the date when the impugned order was made there is nothing to
show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of
exercising her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her
profession as a journalist. The direct and inevitable consequence of the
impugned order was to impede the exercise of her right to go abroad and not to
interfere with her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on
her profession. But we, must hasten to point out that if at any time in the
future the petitioner wants to go abroad for the purpose of exercising her
freedom of speech and expression or for carrying on her profession as a
journalist and she applies to the Central Government to release the passport,
the question would definitely arise whether the refusal to release or in other
words, continuance of the impounding of 707 the passport is in the interests
of public order, decency or morality in the first case, and in the interests
of the general public in the second, and the restriction thus imposed is
reasonable so, as to come within the protection of Article 19(2) or Article
19(6). That is, however, not the question before us at present.

We may observe that if the impugned Order impounding the passport of the
petitioner were violative, of her right to freedom of speech and expression or
her right to carry on her profession as a journalist, it would not be saved by
Article 19(2) or Article 19(6), because the impounding of the passport for an
indefinite length of time would clearly constitute an unreasonable
restriction. The Union contended that though the period for which the impugned
Order was to operate was not specified in so many terms, it was clear that it
was intended to be co-terminous with the duration of the Commission of
Inquiry, since the reason for impounding was that the presence of the
petitioner was likely to be required in connection with the proceedings before
the Com- mission of Inquiry and the term of the Commission of Inquiry being
limited upto 31st December, 1977, the impoundig of the passport could not
continue beyond that date and hence it would not be said that the impugned
Order was to operate for an indefinite period of time. Now, it is true that
the passport of the petitioner was impounded on the ground that her presence
was likely to be required in connection with the proceeding before the
Commission of Inquiry and the initial time limit fixed for the Commission of
Inquiry to submit its report was 31st December, 1977, but the time limit could
always be extended by the Government and the experience of several Commissions
of Inquiry set up in this country over the last twenty-five years shows that
hardly any Commission of Inquiry has been able to complete its report within
the originally appointed time. Whatever might have been the expectation in
regard to the duration of the Commission of Inquiry headed by Mr. Justice
Shall at the time when the impugned Order was made, it is now clear that it
has not been possible for it to complete its labours by 31st December, 1977
which was the time limit originally fixed and in fact its term has been
extended upto 31st May, 1978\. The period for which the passport is impounded
cannot, in the circumstances, be said to be definite and certain and it may
extend to an indefinite point of time. This would clearly make the impugned
order unreasonable and the learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the
Central Government, therefore, made a statement that in case the decision to
impound the passport of the petitioner is confirmed by the Central Government
after hearing the petitioner, "the duration of the impounding will not exceed
a period of six months from the date of the decision that may be taken on the
petitioner's representation". It must be said in fairness to the Central
Government that this was a very reasonable stand to adopt, because in a
democratic society governed by the rule of law, it is expected of the
Government that it should act not only constitutional and legally but also
fairly and justly towards the citizen. We hope and trust that in future also
whenever the passport of any person is impounded under section 10(3) (c), the
impounding would be for a specified period of time which is not unreasonably
long, even though no contravention of any fundamental right may be involved.

708

The last argument that the impugned Order could not, consistently with Article
19(1) (a) and (g), be based on a mere opinion of the Central Government that
the presence of the petitioner is likely to be required in connection with the
proceeding bEfore the Commission of lnquiry is also without force. It is true
that ultimately it is for the Commission of Inquiry to decide whether the
presence of the petitioner is required in order to assist it in its fact
finding mission, but the Central Government which has constituted the
Commission of Inquiry and laid down its terms of reference would certainly be
able, to say with reasonable anticipation whether she is likely to be required
by the Commission of Inquiry. Whether she, is actually required would be for
the Commission of Inquiry to decide, but whether she is likely to be required
can certainly be judged by the Central Government. When the, Central
Government appoints a Commission of Inquiry, it does not act in a vacuum. It
is bound to have some material before it on the basis of which it comes of a
decision that there is a definite matter of public importance which needs to
be inquired into and appoints a Commission of Inquiry for that purpose. The
Central Government would, therefore, be in a position to say whether the
petitioner is likely to be ,required in connection with the proceeding before
the Commission of Inquiry. It is possible that ultimately when the Commission
of Inquiry proceeds further with the probe, it may find that the presence of
the ,petitioner is not required, but before that it would only be in the stage
of likelihood and that can legitimately be left to the judgment of the central
Government. The validity of the impugned Order cannot, ,therefor.-, be
assailed on this ground, had the challenge based on Article 19 (1) (a) and (g)
must fail. Whether the impugned Order is inter vires sec. 10(3) (c) ? The last
question which remains to be considered is whether the impugned Order is
within the authority conferred by section 10(3) (c). The impugned Order is
plainly, on the face of it, purported to be made in public interest, i.e., in
the interests of the general public, and therefore, its validity must be
judged on that footing. Now it is obvious that on a plain natural construction
of section 10(3)(c), it is left to the Passport Authority to determine whether
it is necessary to impound a passport in the interests of the general public.
But an order made by the Passport Authority impounding a passport is subject
to judicial review on the ground that the order is mala fide, or that the
reasons for making the order are extraneous or they have no relevance to the
interests of the general public or they cannot possibly support the making of
the order in the interests of the general public. It was not disputed on
behalf of the Union, and indeed it could not be in view of section 10, sub-
section (5) that, save in certain exceptional cases, of which this was
admittedly not one, the Passport Authority is bound to give reasons for making
an order impounding a passport and though in the present case, the Central
Government initially declined to give reasons claiming that it was not in the
interests of the general public to do so, it realised the utter untenability
of this position when it came to file the affidavit in reply and disclosed the
reasons which were recorded at the time when the impugned order 'Was passed.
These reasons were that, according to the Central Government, the petitioner
was involved 709 in matters coming within the purview of the Commissions of
Inquiry constituted by the Government of India to inquire into excesses
committed during the emergency and in respect of matters concerning Maruti and
its associate companies and the Central Government was of the view that the
petitioner should be available in India to give evidence before these
Commissions of Inquiry and she should have an opportunity to present her views
before them and according to, a report received by the Central Government on
that day, there was likelihood of her leaving India. The argument of the,
petitioner was that these reasons did not justify the making of the, impugned
Order in the interests of the general public, since these reasons had no
reasonable nexus with the interests of the general public within the meaning
of that expression as used in section 10(3) (c). The petitioner contended that
the expression "interests of the general public" must be construed in the
context of the perspective of the statute and since the power to issue a
passport is a power related to foreign affairs, the "interests of the general
public," must be understood as referable only to a matter having some nexus
with foreign affairs and it would not be given a wider meaning. So read, the
expression "interests of the general public" could not cover a situation where
the presence of a person required to give evidence before a Commission of
Inquiry. This argument is plainly erroneous as it seeks to cut down the width
and amplitude of the expression " interests of the general public", an
expression which has a well recognised legal connotation and which is to be
found in Article 19(5) as well as article 19(6). It is true, as pointed out by
this Court in Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. S. D. Agarwal & Anr.(1), that "there
is always a perspective within which a statute is intended to operate", but
that does not justify reading of a statutory provision in a manner not
warranted by its language or narrowing down its scope and meaning by
introducing a limitation which has no basis either in the language or in the
context of the statutory provision. Moreover, it is evident from clauses (d),
(e) and (h) of section 10(3) that there are. several grounds in this section
which do not relate to foreign affairs. Hence we do not think the petitioner
is justified in seeking to limit the expression "interests of the general
public" to matters relating to foreign affairs.

The petitioner then contended that the requirement that she should be
available for giving evidence before the Commissions of Inquiry did not
warrant the making of the impugned Order "in the interests of the general
public". Section 10(3),according to the petitioner, contained clauses

(e) and (h) dealing specifically with cases where a person is required in
connection with a legal proceeding and the enactment of these two specific
provisions clearly indicated the legislative intent that the general power in
section 10(3) (c) under the ground "interests of the general public" was not
meant to be exercised for impounding a passport in cases where a person is
required in connection with a legal proceeding. The Central Government was,
therefore, not entitled to resort to this general power under section 10(3)

(c) for the purpose of impounding the passport of the petitioner on the ground
that she was (1) 1969] 3 S.C.R. 108 at 128.

7-119 SCI /78 710 required to give evidence before the Commissions of Inquiry.
The, power to impound the passport of the petitioner in such a case was either
to be found in section 10(3) (h) or it did not exist at all. This argument is
also unsustainable and must be rejected. It seeks to rely on the maxim
expressio unius exclusio ulterius and proceeds on the basis that clauses (e)
and (h) of section 10(3) are exhaustive of cases where a person is required in
connection with a proceeding, whether before a court or a Commission of
Inquiry, and no resort can be had to the general power under section 10(3)

(c) in cases where a person is required in connection with a proceeding before
a Commission of Inquiry. But it must be noted that this is not a case where
the maxim expressio unius exclusio ulterius has any application at all.
Section 10(3) (e) deals with a case where proceedings are pending before a
criminal court while section 10(3) (b) contemplates a situation where a
warrant or summons for the appearance or a warrant for the arrest, of the
holder of a passport has been issued by a court or an order prohibiting the
departure from India of the holder of the passport has been made by any such
court. Neither of these two provisions deals with a case where a proceeding is
pending before a Commission of Inquiry and the Commission has not yet issued a
summons or warrant for the attendance of the holder of the passport. We may
assume for the purpose of argument that a Commission- of Inquiry is a 'court'
for the purpose of section 10(3)

(h), but even so, a case of this kind would not be covered by section 10(3)
(h) and section 10(3) (e) would in any case not have application. Such a case
would clearly fall within the general power under section 10(3) (c) if it can
be shown that the requirement of the holder of the passport in connection with
the proceeding before the Commission of Inquiry is in the interests of the
general public. It is, of course, open to the Central Government to apply to
the Commission of Inquiry for issuing a summons or warrant, as the case may
be, for the attendance of the holder of the passport before the Commission and
if a summons or warrant is so issued, it is possible that the Central
Government may be entitled to impound the passport under section 10(3) (h).
But that does not mean that before the stage of issuing a summons or warrant
has arrived, the Central Government can- not impound the passport of a person,
if otherwise it can be shown to be in the, interests of the general public to
do so. Section 10(3) (e) and (h) deal only with two specific kinds of
situations, but there may be a myriad other situations, not possible to
anticipate or categorise, where public interests may require that the passport
should be impounded and such situation would be taken care of under the
general provision enacted in section 10(3) (c). It is true that this is a
rather drastic power to interfere with a basic human right, but it must be
remembered that this power has been conferred by the legislature in public
interest and we have no doubt that it will be sparingly used and that too,
with great care and circumspection and as far as possible, the passport of a
person will not be impounded merely on the ground of his being required in
connection with a proceeding, unless the case is brought within section 10(3)
(e) or section 10(3) (b). We may echo the sentiment in Lord Denning's closing
remarks in Ghani v. Jones(1) (1) [1970] Q.B.693.

711

'where the learned Master of the Rolls said : "A man's liberty of movement is
regarded so highly by the law of England that it is not to be hindered or
prevented except on the severest grounds". This liberty is prized equally high
in our country and we are sure that a Government committed to basic human
values will respect it.

We must also deal with one other contention of the petitioner, though we must
confess that it was a little difficult for us to appreciate it. The petitioner
urged that in order that a passport may be impounded under section 10(3) (c),
public interest must actually exist ill presenti and mere likelihood of public
interest arising in future, would be no ground for impoundig a passport. We
entirely agree with the petitioner that an order impounding a passport can be
made by the Passport Authority only if it is actually in the interests of the
general public to do so and it is not enough that the interests of the general
public may be likely to be served in future by the making of the order. But
here in the present case, it was not merely on the future likelihood of the
interests of the general public advanced that the impugned order was made by
the Central Government. The impugned Order was made because, in the opinion of
the Central Government, the presence of the petitioner was necessary for
giving evidence before the Com- missions of Inquiry and according to the
report received by the Central Government, she was likely to leave India and
that might frustrate or impede to some extent the inquiries which were being
conducted by the Commissions of Inquiry. Then it was contended on behalf of
the petitioner that the Minister for External Affairs, who made the impugned
Order on behalf of the Central Government, did not apply his mind and hence
the impugned Order was bad. We find no basis or justification for this
contention. It has been stated in the affidavit in reply that the Minister for
External Affairs applied his mind to the relevant material and also to the
confidential information received from the intelligence sources that there was
likelihood of the petitioner attempting to leave the country and then only he
made the impugned Order. In fact, the Ministry of Home Affairs had forwarded
to the Ministry of External Affairs as far back as 9th May, 1977 a list of
persons whose presence, in view of their involvement or connection or position
or past antecedents, was likely to be required in connection with inquiries to
be carried out by the Commissions of Inquiry and the name of the petitioner
was included in this list. The Home Ministry had also intimated to the
Ministry of External Affairs that since the inquiries were being held by the
Commissions of Inquiry in public interest, consideration of public interest
would justify recourse to section 10(3) (c) for impounding the passports of
the persons mentioned in this list. This note of the Ministry of Home Affairs
was considered by the Minister for External Affairs and despite the suggestion
made in this note, the passports of only eleven persons, out of those
mentioned in the list, were ordered to be impounded and no action was taken in
regard to the passport of the petitioner. It is only on 1st July, 1977 when
the Minister for External Affairs received confidential information that the
petitioner was likely to attempt to leave the country that, after applying his
mind to the relevant material and taking into account confidential
information, 712 he made the impugned Order. It, is, therefore, not possible
to say that the Minister for External Affairs did not apply his mind and
mechanically made the impugned Order. The petitioner lastly contended that it
was not correct to say that the petitioner was likely to be required for
giving evidence before the Commissions of Inquiry. The petitioner, it was
said, had nothing to do with any emergency excesses nor was she connected in
any manner with Maruti or its associate concerns, and, therefore, she could
not possibly have any evidence to give before the Commissions of Inquiry. But
this is not a matter which the court can be called upon to investigate. It is
not for the court to decide whether the presence of the petitioner is likely
to be required for giving evidence before he Commissions of Inquiry. The
Government, which has instituted the Commissions of Inquiry, would be best in
a position to know, having regard to the material before it, whether the
presence of the petitioner is likely to be required. It may be that her
presence may ultimately not be required at all, but at the present stage, the
question is only whether her presence is likely to be required and So Far that
is concerned, we do not think that the view taken by the Government can be
regarded as so unreasonable or perverse that we would strike down the impugned
Order based upon it as an arbitrary exercise of power.

We do not, therefore, see any reason to interfere with the impugned Order made
by the Central Government. We, however, wish to utter a word of caution to the
Passport Authority while exercising the power of refusing or impounding or
cancelling a passport. The Passport Authority would do well to remember that
it is a basic human right recognised in Article 13 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights with which the Passport Authority, is interfering
when it refuses or `impounds or cancels a passport. It is a highly valuable
right which is a part of personal liberty, an aspect of the spiritual
dimension of man, and it should not be lightly interfered with. Cases are not
unknown where people have not been allowed to go abroad because of the views
held, opinions expressed or political beliefs or economic ideologies
entertained by them. It is hoped that such cases will not recur under a
Government constitutionally committed to uphold freedom and liberty but it is
well to remember, at all times, that eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty, for history shows that it is always subtle and insidious
encroachments made ostensibly for a good cause that imperceptibly but surety
corrode the foundations of liberty. In view of the statement made by the
learned Attorney- General to which reference has already been made in the
judgment we do not think it necessary to formally interfere with the impugned
order. We, accordingly, dispose of the Writ Petition without passing any
formal order. There will be no order as to costs.

KRISHNA IYER, J.-My concurrence with the argumentation and conclusion
contained in the judgment of 'my learned brother Bhagwati J. is sufficient to
regard this supplementary, in one sense, a mere redundancy. But in another
sense not, where the vires of a law, which arms the Central Executive with
wide powers of potentially imperilling some 713 of the life-giving liberties
of the people in a pluralist system like ours, is under challenge; and more
so, when the ground is virgin, and the subject is of growing importance to
more numbers as Indians acquire habits of trans-national travel and realise
the fruits of foreign tours, reviving in modem terms, what our forbears
effectively did to put Bharat on the cosmic cultural and commercial map. India
is India because Indians, our ancients, had journeyed through the wide world
for commerce, spiritual and material, regardless of physical or mental
frontiers. And when this precious heritage of free trade in ideas and goods,
association and expression, migration and home-coming, now crystallised in
Fundamental Human Rights, is alleged to be hamstrung by hubristic authority,
my sensitivity lifts the veil of silence. Such is my justification. for
breaking judicial lock-jaw to express sharply the juristic perspective and
philosophy behind the practical necessities and possible dangers that society
and citizenry may face if the clauses of our Constitution are not bestirred
into court action when a charge of unjustified handcuffs on free speech and
unreasonable fetters on right of exit is made through the executive power of
Passport impoundment. Even so, in my separate opinion, I propose only to paint
the back drop with a broad brush, project the high points with bold lines and
touch up the portrait drawn so well by brother Bhagwati J, if I may
colourfully, yet respectfully, endorse his judgment.

Remember, even democracies have experienced executive lawlessness and eclipse
of liberty on the one hind and 'subversive' use of freedoms by tycoons and
saboteurs on the other, and then the summons to judges comes from the
Constitution, over-riding the necessary deference to government and seeing in
perspective, and overseeing in effective operation the enjoyment of the 'great
rights'. This Court lays down the law not pro tempore but lastingly. Before us
is a legislation regulating travel abroad. Is it void in part or over-wide in
terms ? 'Lawful illegality becomes the rule, if 'lawless legislation be not
removed. In our jural order if a statute is void, must the Constitution and
its sentinels sit by silently, or should the lines of legality be declared
with clarity so that adherence to valid norms becomes easy and precise ?. We
are directly concerned, as fully brought out in Shri Justice Bhagwati's
judgment, with the indefinite immobilisation of the petitioner's passport, the
reason for the action being strangely veiled from the victim and the right to
voice an answer being suspiciously withheld from her, the surprising secrecy
being labelled, 'public interest'. Paper curtains wear ill 'on good
governments. And, cutely to side one's grounds under colour of 'statute, is
too sphinx-like an art for an open society and popular regime. As we saw the
reasons which the learned Attorney General so unhesitatingly disclosed, the
question arises : 'wherefore are these things hid?'. The catch-all expression
'public interest' is 'sometimes the easy temptation to cover up from the
public which they have a right to know, which appeals in the short run but
avenges in the long run Since the only passport to this Court's jurisdiction
in this branch of passport law is the breach of a basic freedom, what is the
nexus between a passport and a Part Ill right ? What are 714 the ambience and
amplitude, the desired effect and direct object of them key provisions of the
Passports Act, 1967 ? Do they crib or cut down unconstitutionally, any of the
guarantees under Arts. 21, 19 and 14 ? Is the impugned section 10, especially
S. 10 (3) (c), capable of circums- cription to make it accord with the
Constitution ? Is any part ultra vires, and why ? Finally, granting the Act to
be good, is the impounding order bad ? Such, in the Writ Petition, is the
range of issues regaled at the bar, profound, far-reaching, animated by
comparative scholarship and fertilised by decisional erudition. The frontiers
and funeral of freedom, the necessities and stresses of national integrity,
security and sovereignty, the interests of the general public, public order
and the like figure on occasions as forensic issues. And, in such situations,
the contentious quiet of the court is the storm-centre of the nation. Verily,
while hard cases tend to make bad law, bad cases tend to blur great law and
courts must beware. The centre of the stage in a legal debate on life and
liberty must ordinarily be occupied by Art. 21 of our Paramount Parchment
which, with emphatic brevity and accent on legality, states the mandate thus:

> "21. Protection of life and personal liberty.-

> No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
> to procedure established by law."

Micro-phrases used in National Chatters spread into macro- meanings with the
lambent light of basic law. For our purposes, the key concepts are 'personal
liberty' and 'procedure established by law'. Let us grasp the permissible
restraints on personal liberty, one of the facets of which is the right of
exit beyond one's country. The sublime sweep of the subject of personal
liberty must come within our ken if we are to do justice to the constitutional
limitations which may, legitimately, be im- posed on its exercise. Speaking
briefly, the architects of our Founding Document, (and their fore-runners)
many of whom were front-line fighters for national freedom, were lofty
humanists who were profoundly spiritual and deeply secular, enriched by
vintage values and revolutionary urges and, above all, experientially
conscious of the deadening impact of the colonial screening of Indians going
abroad and historically 'sensitive to the struggle for liberation being waged
from foreign lands. And their testament is our asset. What is the history,
enlivened by philosophy, of the law of travel ? The roots of our past reach
down to travels laden with our culture and commerce and its spread-out beyond
the oceans and the mountains, so much so our history unravels exchange between
India and the wider world. This legacy, epitomised as 'the glory that was
Ind', was partly the product of travels into India and out of India. It was
the two-way traffic of which there is testimony inside in Nalanda, and
outside, even in Ulan Bator. Our literature and arts bear immortal testimony
to our thirst for travel and even our law, over two thousand years ago, had
canalised travels abroad. For instance, in the days of Kautilya (BC 321-296)
there was a Superintendent of Passports 'to issue passes at the rate of a
masha a pass'. Further details on passport law are found in Katutilya's
Arthasastra.

715

Indeed, viewing the subject from the angle of geo-cultural end legal
anthropology and current history, freedom of movement and its off-shoot-the
institution of passport-have been there through the Hellenic, Roman,
Israelite, Chinies, Persian and other civilisations. Socrates, in his dialogue
with Crito, spoke of personal liberty. He regarded the right of everyone to
save his country as an attribute of personal liberty. He made the laws speak
thus "We further proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him,
that if he does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of
the city, and made our ac-

quaintance, he may go where he please and take his goods with him. None of our
laws will forbid him, or interfere with him. Anyone who does not like us and
the city, and who wants to emigrate to a colony or to any other city may go
where he likes, retaining his property."

(Plato, Dialogues) The Magna Carta, way back in 1215 A.D. on the greens of
Runnymede, affirmed the freedom to move beyond the borders of the kingdom and,
by the time of Blackstone, 'by the common law, every man may go out of the
realm for whatever cause he pleaseth, without obtaining the king's leave'.
Lord Diplock in D.P.P. v. Shagwan(1) stated that 'Prior to.... 1962...........
a British subject had the right at common law to enter the United Kingdom
without let or hindrance when and where he pleased and to remain there as long
as he liked' (International & Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 23, July 1974,
p. 646). As late as Ghani v. Jones(2) Lord Denning asserted : 'A man's liberty
of movement is regarded so highly by the Law of England that it is not to be
hindered or prevented except on the 'surest grounds' (I & C. L. Qrly, ibid. p.
646). In 'Freedom under the Law" Lord Denning has observed under the sub-bead
'Personal Freedom' :

> "Let me first define my terms. By personal freedom I mean the freedom of
> every law- abiding citizen to think what he will, to say what he will, and
> to go where he will on his lawful occasions without let or hindrance from
> any other persons. Despite all the great. changes that have come about in
> the other freedoms, this freedom has in our country remained intact."

In 'Freedom, The Individual and the Law, Prof. Street has expressed a like
view. Prof. H.W.R. Wade and Prof. Hood Philips echo this liberal view. (See
Int. & _Comp. L.O. ibid 646). And Justice Douglas, in the last decade, refined
and re-stated, in classic diction, the basics of travel jurisprudence in
Apthekar(3).

> "The freedom of movement is the very essence of our free society, setting us
> apart. Like the right of assembly and the right of association, it often
> makes all rights meaningful (1) [1972]A.C.60.

> (2) [1970] 1 Q. B. 693 709.

> (3) 378 U. S. 500.

> -knowing, studying, arguing, exploring, conversing, observing and even

> America is of course sovereign, but her sovereignty is woven in an

> concerns are planetary beyond sunrises and sunsets. Citizenship implicates
> us in those problems and paraplexities, as well as in domestic ones. We
> cannot exercise and enjoy citizenship in World perspective without the right
> to travel abroad."

And, in India, Satwant(1) set the same high tone through Shri Justice Subba
Rao although A. K. Gopalan(2 ) and a stream of judicial thought since then,
had felt impelled to underscore personal liberty as embracing right to travel
abroad. Tambe CJ in A. G. Kazi(3) speaking for a Division Bench, made a
comprehensive survey of the law and vivified the concept thus:

> "In our opinion, the language used in the Article (Art. 21) also indicates
> that the expression 'Personal liberty' is not confined only to freedom from
> physical restraint, ie.

but includes a full range of conduct which a n individual is free to pursue
within law, for instance, eat and drink what he likes, mix with people whom he
likes, read what he likes, sleep when and as long as he likes, travel wherever
he likes, go wherever he likes, follow profession, vocation or business he
likes, of course, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law."

(P. 240) The legal vicissitudes of the passport story in the United States
bear out the fluctuating fortunes of fine men being denied this great right to
go abroad-Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winner, Charles Chaplin, the screen
super genius, Paul Robesen, the world singer, Arthur Miller, the great author
and even Williams L. Clark, former Chief Justice of the United States Courts
in occupied Germany, among other greats. Judge Clark commented on this
passport affair and the ambassador's role :

> "It is preposterous to say that Dr. Conant can exercise some sort of
> censorship on persons whom he wishes or does not wish to come to the country
> to which he is accredited. This has never been held to be the function of an
> Ambassador."

(P. 275, 20 Clav. St. L.R. 2 May 1971) Men suspected of communist leanings had

country as near communist. Earl Warren. has, in his autobiography, recorded
"Senator Joseph McCarthy once said on the floor of the Senate, 'I will not say
that Earl Warren is a Communist, but I will 'say he is the best friend of
Communism in the United States."

There has been built up lovely American legal literature on passport history
to which I will later refer. British Raj has frowned on foreign travels by
Indian patriotic suspects and instances from the British Indian Chapter may
abound. Likewise, the Establishment, in many countries has used the passport
and visa system as potent paper curtain to inhibit illustrious writers,
outstanding statesmen, humanist churchmen and renowned scientists, if they are
dissenters', from leaving their national frontiers. Absent forensic sentinels,
it is not unusual for people to be suppressed by power in the name of the
people. The politics of passports has often tried to bend the jurisprudence of
personal locomotion to serve its interests. The twilight of liberty must
affect the thought ways of judges.

Things have changed, global awareness, in grey hues, has dawned. The European
Convention on Human Rights and bilateral understandings have made headway to
widen freedom of travel abroad as integral to liberty of the person (Fourth
Protocol). And the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has proclaimed in
Art. 13 :

> "(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the
> borders of each State.

> (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to
> return to his country."

This right is yet inchoate and only lays the base. But, hopefully, the
loftiest towers rise from the ground. And despite destructive was and
exploitative trade, racial hatreds and credal quarrels, colonial subjections
and authoritarian spells, the world has advanced because of gregarious men
adventuring forth, taking with them their thoughts and feelings on a trans-
national scale. This human planet is our single home, though geographically
variegated, culturally diverse, politically pluralist, in science and
technology competitive and cooperative, in arts and life- styles a lovely
mosaic and, above all, suffused with a cosmic consciousness of unity and
inter-dependence. This Grand Canyon has been the slow product of the perennial
process of cultural interaction, intellectual cross- fertilization,
ideological and religious confrontations and meeting and mating of social
systems; and the wellspring is the wanderlust of man and his wondrous spirit
moving towards a united human order founded on human rights. Human advance has
been promoted through periods of pre-history and history by the flow of
fellowmen, and the world owes much to exiles and emigres for liberation,
revolution, scientific exploration and excellence in arts. Stop this creative
mobility by totalitarian decree and whole communities and cultures will
stagnate and international awakening so vital for the survival of homo sapiens
wither away. To argue for arbitrary inhibition of travel rights under
executive directive or legislative tag is to invite 718 and accelerate future
shock. This broader setting is necessary if we, are to view the larger import
of the right to passport in its fundamental bearings. It is not law alone but
life's leaven. It is not a casual facility but the core of liberty.

Viewed from another angle, travel abroad is a cultural enrichment which
enables one's understanding of one's own country in better light. Thus it
serves national interest to have its citizenry 'see other countries and judge
one's country on a comparative scale. Rudyard. Kipling, though with an
imperial ring, has aptly said "Winds of the World, give answer They are
whimpering to and fro And what should they know of England Who only England
know ?"

(The English Flag) Why is the right to travel all over the world and into the
beyond a human right and a constitutional freedom ? Were it not so, the human
heritage would have been more hapless, the human family more divided, the
human order more unstable and the human future more murky.

The Indian panorama from the migrant yore to tourist flow is an expression of
the will to explore the Infinite, to promote understanding of the universe, to
export human expertise and development of every resource. Thus humble pride of
patriotic heritage would have been pre-empted had the ancient kings and
mediaval rulers banished foreign travel as our imperial masters nearly did.
And to look at the little letters of the text of Part III de hors the
Discovery of India and the Destiny of Bharat or the divinity of the 'soul and
the dignity of the person highlighted in the Preamble unduly obsessed with
individual aberrations of yesteryears or vague hunches leading to current
fears, is a parsimonious exercise in constitutional perception.

Thus, the inspirational background. cosmic perspective and inherited ethos of
the pragamtic visionaries and jurist- statesmen who draw up the great Title
Deed of our Republic must illumine the sutras of Articles 21, 19 and 14. The
fascist horror of World War II burnt into our leaders the urgency of
inscribing indelibly into our Constitution those values sans which the dignity
of man suffers total eclipse. The Universa l Declaration of Human Rights, the
resurgence of international fellowship, the vulnerability of freedoms even in
democracies and the rapid development of an integrated and intimately
interacting 'one world' poised for peaceful and progressive intercourse
conditioned their thought processes. The bitter feeling of the British Raj
trampling under foot swaraj the birth-right of every Indian- affected their
celebrations. The hidden divinity in every human entity creatively impacted
upon our founding fathers' mentations. The mystic chords of ancient memory and
the modern strands of the earth's indivisibility, the pathology of
provincialism, feudal backwardness, glaring inequality Ind bleeding
communalism, the promotion of tourism, of giving and taking know-

how, of studying abroad, and inviting scholars from afar- these and other
realistic considerations gave tongue to those hallowed human rights fortified
by the impregnable provisions of Part 111. Swami Vivekananda, that saintly
revolutionary who spanned East and West, exhorted, dwelling on the nation's
fall of the last century :

From the point of view of comparative law too, the position is well
established. For, one of the essential attributes of citizenship, says Prof.
Schwartz, is freedom of movement. The right of free movement is a vital
element of personal liberty. The right of free movement includes the right to
travel abroad. So much is simple textbook teaching in Indian, as in Anglo-
American law. Passport legality, affecting as it does, freedoms that are
'delicate and vulnerable, as well as supremely precious in our society',
cannot but excite judicial vigilance to obviate fragile dependency for
exercise of fundamental rights upon executive clemency. So important is this
subject that the watershed between a police state and a government by the
people may partly turn on the prevailing passport policy. Conscious, though I
am, that such prolix 720 elaboration of environmental aspects is otiose, the
Emergency provsions of our Constitution, the extremes of rigour the nation has
experienced (or may) and the proneness of Power to stoop to conquer make
necessitous the hammering home of vital values expressed in terse
constitutional vocabulary.

Among the great guaranteed rights, life and liberty are the first among
equals, carrying a universal connotation cardinal to a decent human order and
protected by constitutional armour. Truncate liberty in Art. 21 traumatically
and the several other freedoms fade out auto- matically. Justice Douglas, that
most distinguished and perhaps most travelled judge in the world, has in
poetic prose and with imaginative realism projected the functional
essentiality of the right to travel as part of liberty. I may quote for
emphasis, what is a woe bit repetitive "The right to travel is a part of
'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law
under the, fifth Amendment........ In Anglo Saxon law that right was emerging
at least as early as the Magna Carta........ Travel abroad, like travel within
the country, may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the
heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats or wears or reads.
Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values." (Kent v.

Dulles: 357 US 116-2 L. Ed. 2d. 1204 1958).

"Freedom of movement also has large social values. As Chafoe put it : 'Foreign
correspondents on lectures on public affairs need first-hand information.
Scientists and scholars gain greatly from consultations with colleagues in
other countries. Students equip themselves for more fruitful careers in the
United States by instruction in foreign universities. Then there are reasons
chose to the core of personal life-marriage reuniting families, spending hours
with old friends. Finally travel abroad enables American citizens to
understand that people like themselves live in Europe and helps them to be
well-informed on public issues. An American who has crossed the ocean is not
obliged to form his opinions about our foreign policy merely from what he is
told by officials of our Government or by a few correspondents of American
newspapers. Moreover, his views on domestic questions are enriched by seeing
how foreigners are trying to solve similar problems. In many different ways
direct contact with other countries contributes to sounder decisions at
home....

Freedom to travel is, indeed, an important aspect of the citizen's liberty".

(Kent v. Dulles) "Freedom of movement at home and abroad, is important for job
and business opportunities- for cultural, political and social activities- for
all the commingling which gregarious man enjoys. Those with the right of free
movement use it at times for mischievous purposes. But that is true of many
liberties we, enjoy. We nevertheless place our faith in them and  721 against
restraint, knowing that the risk of abusing liberty so as to give right to
punishable conduct is part of the price we pay for this free society.

(Apthekar v. Secretary of State : 378 US 500- 12 L.Ed. 2d 992 (1964).

Judge Wyzanski has said "This travel does not differ from any other exercise
of the manifold freedoms of expression....... from the right to speak, to
write, to use the mails, to public, to assemble, to petition."

(Wyzanski, Freedom to Travel, Atlantic Montaly. Oct. 1952, p. 66 at 68).

The American Courts have, in a sense, blazed the constitutional trail on that
facet of liberty which relates to untrammelled travel. Kent, Apthekar and
Zemel are the landmark cases and American jurisprudence today holds as a
fundamental part of liberty (V Amendment) that a citizen has freedom to move
across the frontiers without passport restrictions subject, of course, to
well-defined necessitous exceptions. Basically, Blackstone is still current
coin "Personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion, of changing
direction or moving one's person to whatever place one's own inclination may
desire."

To sum up, personal liberty makes for the worth of the human person. Travel
makes liberty worthwhile. Life is a terrestrial opportunity for unfolding
personality, rising to higher states, moving to fresh woods and reaching out
to reality which makes our earthly journey a true fulfilment- not a tale told
by an idiot full of 'sound and fury signi- fying nothing, but a fine frenzy
rolling between heaven and earth. The spirit of Man is at the root of Art. 21.
Absent liberty, other freedoms are frozen.

While the issue is legal and sounds in the constitutional, its appreciation
gains in human depth given a planetary perspective and understanding of the
expanding range of travel between the 'inner space' of Man and the 'outer
space' around Mother Earth.

To conclude this Chapter of the discussion on the concept of personal liberty,
as a sweeping supplement to the specific treatment by brother Bhagwati J., the
Jurists' Conference in Bangalore, concluded in 1969, made a sound statement of
the Indian Law subject, of course, to savings and exceptions carved out of the
generality of that conclusion "Freedom of movement of the individual within or
in leaving his own country, in traveling to other countries and in entering
his own country is a vital human liberty, whether such movement is for the
purpose of recreation, education, trade or employment, or to escape from an
environment in  722 which his other liberties are suppressed or threatened.
Moreover, in an inter-dependent world requiring for its future peace and
progress an ever-growing measure of international understanding, it is
desirable to facilitate individual contacts between peoples and to remove all
unjustifiable restraints on their movement which may hamper such contacts."

So much for personal liberty and its travel facet. Now to 'procedure
established by law', the manacle clause in Art. 21, first generally and next,
with reference to A. K. Gopalan (supra) and after. Again, I observe relative
brevity because I go the whole bog with brother Bhagwati, J. If Article 21
includes the freedom of foreign travel, can its exercise be fettered or
forbidden by procedure established by law ? Yes, indeed. So, what is
'procedure' ? What do we mean by 'established' ? And What is law ? Anything,
formal, legislatively processed, albeit absurd or arbitrary ? Reverence for
life and liberty must over power this reduction an absurdem' Legal
interpretation, in the last analysis, is value judgment. The high seriousness
of the subject matter-life and liberty-desiderates the need for law, not fiat.
law is law when it is legitimated by the conscience and consent of the
community generally. Not any capricious compthe but reasonable: mode
ordinarily regarded by the cream of society as dharma or law, approximating
broadly to other standard measures regulating criminal or like, procedure in
the country. Often, it is a legislative act, but it must be functional, not
fatuous. This line of logic alone will make the two clauses of Art. 21
concordant, the procedural machinery not destroying the substantive
fundamentally. The compulsion of constitutional humanism and the assumption of
full faith in life and liberty cannot be, so futile or fragmentary that any
transient legislative majority in tantrums against any minority, by three
quick readings of a bill with the requisite quorum; can prescribe any
unreasonable modality and thereby sterilise the grandiloquent mandate.
'Procedure established by law', with its lethal potentiality, will reduce life
and liberty to a precarious plaything if we do not ex necessitate import into
those weighty words an, adjectival rule of law, civilised in its soul, fair in
its heart and fixing those imperatives of procedural protection absent which
the processual tail will wag the substantive head. Can the sacred essence of
the human right to secure which the struggle for liberation, with 'do or die'
patriotism, was launched be sapped by formalistic and pharisaic prescriptions,
regardless of essential standards ? An enacted apperition is a constitutional
illusion. Processual justice is writ patently on Art. 21. It is too grave to
be circumvented by a black letter ritual processed through the legislature.

So I am convinced that to frustrate Art. 21 by relying on any formal
adjectival statute, however, filmsy or fantastic its provisions be, is to rob
what the constitution treasures. Procedure which deals with the modalities of
regulating, restricting or even rejecting a fundamental right falling within,
Art. 21 has to be fair, riot foolish, carefully 723 designed to, effectuate.
not to subvert, the substantive right itself. Thus understood, 'procedure'
must rule out anything arbitrary freakish or bizarre. A valuable
constitutional right can be canalised only by civilised processes. You cannot
claim that it is a legal procedure if the passport is granted or refused by
taking loss, ordeal of fire or by other strange or mystical methods. Nor is it
tenable if life is taken by a crude or summary process of enquiry. What is
fundamental is life and liberty. What is procedural is the manner of its
exercise,. This quality of fairness in the process is emphasised by the strong
word ,established which means 'settled firmly not wantonly whimsically. If it
is rooted in the legal consciousness of the community it becomes '
established' procedure. And 'Law' leaves little doubt that it is normae,
regarded as just since law is the means and justice is the end. Is there
supportive judicial thought for this reasoning. We go back to the vintage
words of the learned Judges in A. K. Gopalan (supra) and zigzag through R. C.
Cooper to S. N. Sarkar and discern attestation of this conclusion. And the
elaborate constitutional procedure in Art. 22 itself fortifies the argument
that 'life and liberty' in Art. 21 could not have been left to illusory
legislators happenstance. Even as relevant reasonableness informs art. 14 and
19, the component of fairness is implicit in Art. 21. A close-up of the
Gopalan case (supra) is necessitous at this stage to underscore the quality of
procedure relevant to personal liberty.

Procedural safeguards are the indispensable essence of liberty. In fact, the
history of personal liberty is large the history of procedural safeguards and
right to a hearing has a human-right ring. In India, because of poverty and
illiteracy, the people are unable to protect and defend their rights;
observance of fundamental rights is not regarded as good politics and their
transgression as had politics. I sometimes pensively reflect that people's
militant awareness of rights and duties is a surer constitutional assurance of
governmental respect and res- ponse than the sound and fury of the 'question
hour' and the slow and unsure delivery of court writ 'Community Consciousness
and the Indian Constitution is a fascinating subject of sociological relevance
in many areas. To sum up, 'procedure' in Art. 21 means fair, not formal
procedure. 'Law' is reasonable law, not any enacted piece. As Art. 22
,specifically spells out the procedural safeguards for preventive and punitive
detention, a law providing for such detentions should conform to Art. 22. It
has been rightly pointed out that for other rights forming part of personal
liberty, the procedural safeguards enshrined in Art. 21 are available.
Otherwise, as the procedural safeguards contained in Art. 22 will be available
only in cases of preventive and punitive detention, the right to life, more
fundamental than any other forming part of personal liberty and paramount to
the happiness, dignity and worth of the individual, will not be entitled to
any procedural safeguard save such as a legislature's mood chooses. In,
Kochunni(1) the Court, doubting the correctness of the Gopalan decision on
this aspect, said : (1) A. I. R. 1960 S. C. 1080,1093.

724

.lm15 "Had the question been res integra, some of us would have been inclined
to agree with the dissenting view expressed by Fazal Ali, J."

Gopalan does contain some luscent thought on 'Procedure established by law'.
Patanjali Sastri, J. approximated it to the prevalent norms of criminal
procedure regarded for a long time by Indo-Anglian criminal law as
conscionable. The learned Judge observed :

> "On the other hand, the interpretation suggested by the Attorney General on
> behalf of the intervener that the expression means nothing more than
> procedure prescribed by any law made by a competent legislature is hardly
> more acceptable. 'Established', according to him, means prescribed, and if
> Parliament or the Legislature of a State enacted a proce- dure, however
> novel and ineffective for affording the accused person a fair opportunity of
> defending himself, it would be sufficient for depriving a person of his life
> of personal liberty."

> (pp. 201-203) "The main difficulty I feel in accepting the construction
> suggested by the Attorney General is that it completely stultifies article
> 13(2) and, indeed, the very conception of a fundamental right........ could
> it then have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the
> most important fundamental rights to life and personal liberty should be at
> the mercy of legislative majorities as, in effect, they would if
> 'established' were to mean merely prescribed ?

In other words, as an American Judge said in a similar context, does the
constitutional prohibition in article 13(3) amount to 'no more than 'your
shall not take away life or personal freedom unless you choose to take it
away, which is more verbiage......... It is said that article 21 affords no
protection against competent legislative action in the field of substantive
criminal law, for there is no provision for judicial review, on the ground of
reasonableness or otherwise, of such laws, as in the case of the rights
enumerated in article 19. Even assuming it to be so the construction of the
learned Attorney Genera l would have the effect of rendering wholly
ineffective and illusory even the procedural protection which the article was
undoubtedly designed to afford."

(p. 202) (emphasis, added) "After giving the matter my most careful and
anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two
possible solutions of the problem. In the first place, a satisfactory via
media between the two extreme positions contended for on either side may be
found by stressing the word 'established' which implies some degree of
firmness, permanence and general acceptance, while it does not exclude
origination by statute. 'Procedure esta-

725

blished by' may well be taken to mean what the Privy Council referred to in
King Emperor v. Bengori Lal Sharma as 'the ordinary and well established
criminal procedure', that is to say, those settled usages and normal modes of
proceeding sanctioned by the Criminal Procedure Code which is the general law
of Criminal procedure in the country.

(p. 205) Fazal Ali, J. frowned on emasculating the procedural substantiality
of Art. 21 and read into it those essentials of natural justice which made
processual law humane : The teamed Judge argued :

> "It seems to me that there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that the
> words 'Procedure established by law' must include the four principles set
> out in Professor Willis' book, which, as I have already stated, are
> different aspects of the same principle and which have no vagueness or
> uncertainty about them. These principles, as the learned author points out
> and as the authorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles but are
> adaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits. I have
> only to add, that it has not been seriously controverted that 'law' means
> certain definite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere
> pretence for procedure.

(emphasis, added) In short, fair adjectival law is the very life of the life-
liberty fundamental right (Art. 21), 'not 'autocratic supremacy of the
legislature'. Mahajan J. struck a concordant note :

> "Article 21 'in my opinion, lays down substantive law as giving protection
> to' life and liberty in as much as it says that they cannot be deprived
> except according to the procedure established by law; in other words, it
> means that before a person can be deprived of his life or liberty as a
> condition precedent there should exist some substantive law conferring
> authority for doing so and the law should further provide for a mode of
> procedure for such deprivation., This articles gives complete immunity
> against the exercise of despotic power by the executive. It further gives
> immunity against invalid laws which contravene the Constitution. It gives
> also further guarantee that in its true concept there should be some form of
> proceeding before a person can be condemned either in respect of his life or
> his liberty. It negatives the idea of a fantastic arbitrary and oppressive
> form of proceedings."

(emphasis, added) In sum, Fazal Ali, J. struck the chord which does accord
with a just processual system where liberty is likely to be the victim. May
be, the learned Judge stretched it a little beyond the line but in essence his
norms claim my concurrence.

8-119 SCI/78 726 In John v. Rees(1) the true rule, as implicit in any law, is
set down "If there is any doubt, the applicability of the principles will be
given the benefit of doubt."

And Lord Denning, on the theme of liberty, observed in Schmidt V. Secretary of
State (2) "Where a public officer has power to deprive a person of his liberty
or his property, the general principle is that it is not to be done without
hearing."

Human rights:

It is a mark of interpretative respect for the higher norms our founding
fathers held dear in affecting the dearest rights of life and liberty so to
read Art. 21 as to result in a human order lined with human justice. And
running right through Arts. 19 and 14 is present this principle of reasonable
procedure in different shades. A certain normative harmony among the, articles
is thus attained, and hold Art. 21 bears in its bosom the construction of fair
procedure legislatively sanctioned. No Passport Officer shall be mini-Caesar
nor Minister incarnate Caesar in a system where the rule of law reigns
supreme. My clear conclusion on Art. 21 is that liberty of locomotion into
alien territory cannot be unjustly forbidden by the Establishment and passport
legislation must take processual provisions which accord with fair norms, free
from extraneous pressure and, by and large, complying with natural justice.
Unilateral arbitrariness, police dossiers, faceless affiants, behind-the-back
materials, oblique motives and the inscrutable face of an official sphinx do
not fill the 'fairness' bill-subject, of course, to just exceptions and
critical contexts. This minimum once aban- doned, the Police State slowly
builds up which saps the finer substance of our constitutional jurisprudence.
Not party but principle and policy are the key-stone of our Republic.

Let. us not forget that Art. 21 clubs life with liberty and when we interpret
the colour and content of 'procedure established by law' we must be alive to
the deadly peril of life being deprived without minimal processual justice,
legislative callousness despising 'hearing' and fair opportunities of defence.
And this realization once sanc- tioned, its exercise will swell till the basic
freedom is flooded out. Hark back to Art. 10 of the Universal Declaration to
realize that human rights have but a verbal hollow if the protective armour of
audi alteram partem is deleted. When such pleas are urged in the familiar name
of pragmatism public interest or national security, courts are on trial and
must prove that civil liberties are not mere rhetorical material for lips
service but the, obligatory essence of our bard-won (1) [1969] 2 all E. R.
274.

(2) [1969] 2 Ch. 149.

727

freedom. A Republic-if you Can Keep It-is the caveat for counsel and court.
And Tom Paine, in his Dissertation on First Principles of Government, sounded
the tossin:

> "He that would make, his own liberty secure most guard even his enemy from
> oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that
> will reach to himself."

Phoney freedom is not worth the word and this ruling of ours is not confined
to the petitioner but to the hungry job- seeker, nun and nurse, mason and
carpenter, welder and fitter and, above all, political dissenter. The. last
category, detested as unreasonable, defies the Establish- ment's tendency to
enforce through conformity but is the resource of social change. "The
reasonable man", says G. B. Shaw;

.lm15 " adapts himself to the word; the unreasonable one persists in trying to
adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the
unreasonable man." (George Bernard Shaw in 'Maxims for Revolutionists').

'Passport' peevishness is a suppressive possibility, and so the words of
Justice Jackson (U.S. Supreme Court) may be apposite:

> "Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That
> would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substanc e is the right
> to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order." (West
> Yirginia State Board of Education v. Barnetto 319 US 624 (1943).

Under our constitutional order, the price of daring dissent shall not be
passport forfeit.

The impugned legislation, ss. 5, 6 and 10 especially, must be tested even
under Art. 21 on canons of processual justice to the people outlined above.
Hearing is obligatory- meaningful hearing, flexible and realistic, according
to circumstances, but hot ritualistic and wooden. In exceptional cases and
emergency situations, interim measures may be taken, to avoid the mischief of
the passportee becoming an escapee before the hearing begins. 'Bolt the
stables after the horse has been stolen' is not a command of 'natural justice.
But soon after the provisional seizure, a reasonable hearing must follow, to
minimise procedural prejudice. And when a prompt final order is made against
the applicant or passport holder the reasons must be disclosed to him almost
invariably save in those dangerous cases where irreparable injury will ensue
to the State. A government which reveals in secrecy in the field of people's
liberty not only acts against democratic decency but busies itself with its
own burial. That is the writing on the wall if history were teacher, memory
our mentor and decline of liberty not our unwitting endeavour. Public power
must rarely hide its heart in an open society and system.

728

I now skip Art.14 since I agree fully with all that my learned brother
Bhagwati J.has said. That article has a Pervasive processual potency and
versatilequality, egalitarian in its soul and allergic to discriminatory
diktats.Equality is the, antithesis of arbitrariness and excathedra ipse dixit
is the ally of demagogic authoritarianism. Only knight-errants of 'executive
excesses'-if we may use a current cliche--can fall in love with the Dame, of
despotism, legislative or administrative. If this Court gives in here it gives
up the ghost. And so it that I insist on the dynamics of limitations on
fundamental freedoms as implying the rule of law; Be you, ever so high, the
law is above you.' A minor pebble was thrown to produce a little ripple. It
was feebly suggested that the right to travel abroad cannot be guaranteed by
the State because it has no extra- territorial jurisdiction in foreign lands.
This is a naive misconception of the point pressed before us. Nobody contends
that India should interfere with other countries and their sovereignty to
ensure free movement of Indians in those countries. What is meant is that the
Government of India should not prevent by any sanctions it has over its
citizens from moving within any other country if that other country has no
objection to their travelling within its territory. It is difficult to
understand how one can misunderstand the obvious.

A thorny problem debated recurrently at the bar, turning on Art. 19, demands
some juristic response although avoidance of overlap per- suades me to drop
all other questions canvassed before us. The Gopalan (supra) verdict, with the
cocooning of Art. 22 into a self contained code, has suffered supersession at
the hands of R. C. Cooper(1).. By way of aside, the fluctuating fortunes of
fundamental rights, when the proletarist and the proprietariat have asserted
them in Court, partially provoke sociological research and hesitantly project
the Cardozo thesis of sub- conscious forces in judicial noesis when the
cycloramic review starts from Gopalan, moves on to In re : Kerala Education
Bill and then on to All India Bank Employees Union, next to Sakai Newspapers,
crowning in Cooper(1) and followed by Bennet Coleman(2) and Sambu Nath
Sarkar(3). Be that as it may, the law is now settled, as I apprehend it, that
no article in Part III is an island but part of a continent, and the
conspectus of the whole part gives the directions and correction needed for
interpretation of these basic provisions. Man is not dissectible into separate
limbs and, likewise, cardinal rights in an organic constitution, which make
man human have a synthesis. The proposition is indubitable, that art. 21 does
not, in a given situation, exclude Art. 19 if both rights are breached.

We may switch to Art. 19 very briefly and travel along another, street for a
while. Is freedom of extra-territorial travel to assure which is the primary
office of an Indian passport, a facet of the freedom of speech and expression,
of profession or vocation under Article 19?

My total consensus with Shri Justice Bhagwati jettisons from this judgment the
profusion of precedents and the mosaic of many points and confines me to some
fundamentals confusion on which, with all the clarity on details, may mar the
conclusion. It is a salutary thought that the summit court should not
interpret constitutional rights enshrined in Part III to choke its life-breath
or chill its elan vital by processes of legalism, overruling the enduring
values burning in the bosoms of those who won our Independence and drew up our
founding document. We must also remember that when this Court lays down the
law, not ad hoc tunes but essential notes, not temporary tumult but
transcendental truth, must guide the judicial process in translating into
authoritative notation the mood music of the Constitution. While dealing with
Art. 19 vis a vis freedom to travel abroad, we have to remember one spinal
indicator. True, high constitutional policy has harmonised individual freedoms
with holistic community good by inscribing exception's to Art. 19(1) in Art.
19(2) to (6). Even so, what is fundamental is the freedom, not the exception.
More importantly, restraints are permissible only to the extent they have
nexus with the approved object. For instance, in a wide sense, 'the interests
of the general public' are served by a family planning programme but it may be
constitutional impertinence to insist that passports may be refused if
sterilisation certificates were not produced. Likewise, it is in public
interest to widen streets in cities but monstrous to impound a passport
because its holder has declined to demolish his house which projects into the
street line. Sure, the security of State is a paramount consideration but can
Govemment, totalitarian fashion. cquate Part,, country and refuse travel
document because, while abroad, he may criticise the conflicting politics of
the Party-in-power or the planning economics of the government of the day? Is
it conceivable that an Indian will forfeit his right to go abroad because his
flowing side-bums or sartorial vagaries offend a high-placed autho- rity's
sense of decency ? The point is that liberty can be curtailed only if the
grounds listed in the saving sub- articles are directly, specifically,
substantially and imminently attracted so that the basic right may not be
stultified. Restraints are necessary and validly made by statute, but to paint
with an over-broad brush a power to blanketban travel abroad is to sweep
overly and invade illicitly. 'The law of fear' cannot reign where the
proportionate danger is containable. It is a balancing process, not over-
weighted one way or the other. Even so, the perspective is firm and fair.
Courts must not interfere where the order is not perverse, unreasonable, mala
fide or supported by no material. Under our system, court writs cannot run
government, for, then, judicial review may tend to be a judicial coup. But
'lawless' law and executive excess must be halted by judge-power best the
Constitution be subverted by branches deriving credentials from the
Constitution. An imperative guideline by which the Court will test the
soundness of legislative and executive constraint is, in the. language of V.
C. Row(1) this (1) [1952]S.C.R.597.

.lm15 "The reasonableness of a restriction depends upon the values of life in
a society, the circumstances obtaining at a particular point of time when the
restriction is imposed, the degree and the urgency of the evil sought to be
controlled an similar others."

What characterises the existence and eclipse of the right of, exit ? Breathes
there the man with soul so dead' who, if he leaves, will not return to his own
'native land'? Then, why restrict ? The question, presented so simplistically,
may still have overtones of security sensitivity and sovereignty complexity
and other internal and external factors, and that is why the case which we are
deciding has spread the canvas wide. I must express a pensive reflection,
sparked off by submissions at the bar, that, regardless of the 'civil liberty'
credentials or otherwise of a particular government and mindless of the finer
phraseology of a restrictive legislation, eternal vigilance by the superior
judiciary and the enlightened activists who are the catalysts of the
community, is the perpetual price of the preservation of every freedom we
cherish. For, if unchecked, 'the greater the power, the more dangerous the
abuse.' To deny freedom of travel or exit to one untenably is to deny it to
any or many likewise, and the right to say 'Aye' or 'nay' to any potential
traveller should, therefore, not rest with the minions or masters of
government without being gently and benignly censored by constitutionally
sanctioned legislative norms if the reality of liberty is not be drowned in
the hysteria of the hour or the hubris of power. It is never trite to repeat
that where laws end, tyranny begins', and law becomes. unlaw even if it is
legitimated by three legislative readings and one assent, if it is not in
accord with constitutional provisions, beyond abridgement by the two branches
of government. In the context of scray expressions like 'security' 'public
order, 'public interest' and 'friendly foreign relations', we must warn
ourselves that not verbal tables but real values are the governing
considerations in the exploration and adjudication of constitutional
prescriptions and proscriptions. Governments come and go, but the fundamental
rights of the people cannot be subject to the wishful value- sets of political
regimes of the passing day. The learned Attorney General argued that the right
to travel abroad was no part of Art. 19(1) (a), (b), (c), (f) or (g) and so to
taboo travel even unreasonably does not touch Art.

19\. As a component thereof, as also by way of separate submission, it was
urged that the direct effect of the passport law (and refusal thereunder) was
not a blow on freedom of speech, of association or of profession and,
therefore, it could not be struck down even if it overflowed Art. 19(2), (4)
and (6). This presentation poses the issue, 'What is the profile 'of our free
system ?' Is freedom of speech integrally interwoven with locomotion ? Is
freedom of profession done to death if a professional, by passport refusal
without reference to Art. 19 (f ), is inhibited from taking up a job offered
abroad ? is freedom of association such a hot-house plant that membership of
an international professional or political Organisation can be cut off on
executive-legislative ipse dixit without obedience to Art. 19(4) ?

731

This renophatic touch has not been attested by the Constitution and is not
discernible in the psyche. An anti- international pathology shall not afflict
our National Charter. A Human Tomorrow on Mother Earth is our cosmic
constitutional perspective (See Art. 51 To. my mind, locomotion is, in some
situation, necessarily. involved in the exercise of the specified fundamental
rights as an associated or integrated right. Travel, simiplicter, is
peripheral to and not necessarily fundamental in Art. 19. Arguendo, free
speech is feasible without movement beyond the country, although soilequies
and solo songs are not the vogue in this ancient land of silent saints and
pyrating gurus, bhajans and festivals. Again, travel may ordinarily be 'action
and only incidentally 'expression', to borrow the Zemel diction.

Movement within the territory of India is not tampered with by the impugned
order, but that is not all. For, if our notions are en current, it is common
place that the world- the family of nations--vibrates, and men-masses of man-
move and 'jet' abroad and abroad, even in Concorde, on a scale unknown to
history. Even thoughts, ideologies and habits travel beyond. Tourists crowd
out airline services; job- seekers rush to passport offices; lecture tours,
cultural exchanges, trans-national evangelical meets, scientific and scholarly
studies and workshops and seminars escalate, and international associations
abound-all for the good of world peace and human progress, save where are
involved high risks to sovereignty, national security and other substantial
considerations which Constitutions and Courts have readily recognised. Our
free system is not so brittle or timorous as to be scared into tabooing
citizens trips abroad, except conducted tours or approved visits sanctioned by
the Central Executive and indifferent to Art. 19. Again, the core question
arises, Is movement abroad so much a crucial part of free speech, free
practice of profession and the like that denial of the first is a violation of
the rest? I admit that merely because speaking mostly involves some movement,
therefore, 'free speech anywhere is dead if free movement everywhere is
denied', does not follow. The Constitutional lines must be so drawn that the
constellation of fundamental rights does not expose the peace, security and
tranquillity of the community to high risk. We cannot over-stretch free speech
to make it an inextricable component of travel.

Thomas Emerson has summed the American Law which rings a bell even in the
Indian system :

> "The values and functions of the freedom of expression in a democratic
> polity are obvious. Freedom of expression is essentially as a means of
> assuring individual self-fulfilment. The proper end of man is the
> realisation of his character and potentialities as a human being. For the
> achievement of this self- realisation the mind must be free." Again  732
> "Freedom of expression is an essential process for advancing knowledge and
> discovering truth. So also for participation in decision-making in a
> democratic society. Indeed free expression furthers stability in the
> community by reasoning together instead of battling against each other. Such

Travel is more than speech : it is speech bridged with conduct, in the words
of Justice Douglas:

> "Restrictions on the right to travel in times of peace should be so
> particularized that at First Amendment right is not precluded unless some
> clear countervailing national interest stands in the way. of its assertion."

I do not take this. as wholly valid in our Part III scheme but refer to it as
kindred reasoning.

The delicate, yet difficult, phase of the controversy arrives where free
speech and free practice of profession are inextricably interwoven with travel
abroad. The Passport Act, in terms, does not inhibit expression and only
regulates action-to borrow the phraseology of Chief Justice Warren in Zemel.
But we have to view the proximate and real conservance of thwarting trans-
national travel through the 733 power of the State exercised under s. 3 of the
Passport Act read, A with ss. 5, 6 and 10. If a right is not in express terms
fundamental within the meaning of Part III, does it escape Art. 13, read with
the trammels of Art. 19, even if the immediate impact, the substantial
,effect, the proximate import or the necessary result is prevention of free
speech or practice of one's profession ? The answer is that as- sociated
rights, totally integrated, must enjoy the same immunity. Not otherwise.

Three sets of cases may be thought of. Firstly, where the legislative
provision or executive order expressly forbids exercise in foreign lands of
the fundamental right while grunting passport. Secondly, there may be cases
where even if the order is- innocent on its face, the refusal of permission to
go to a foreign country may, with certainty and immediacy, spell denial of
free speech and professional practice or business. Thirdly, the fundamental
right may itself enwomb locomotion regard-. less of national frontiers. The
second and third often are blurred in their edges and may overlap.

The first class may be illustrated. If the passport authority specifically
conditions the permission with a direction not to address meetings abroad or
not to be a journalist or professor in a foreign country, the order violate
Art. 19(1) (a) or (f) and stands voided unless Art. 19 (2) and (6) are
complied with. The second category may be exemplified and examined after the
third which is of less frequent occurrence. If 'a person is an international
pilot, astronaut, Judge. of the International Court of Justice, Secretary of
the World Peace Council, President of a body of like nature, the particular
profession not only calls for its practice travelling outside Indian territory
but its core itself is international travel. In such an area, no right of
exit, no practice of profession or vocation. Similarly, a cricketer or tennis
player recruited on a world tour. Free speech may similarly be bit by
restriction on a campaigner for liberation of colonial peoples or against
genocide before the United Nations Organisation. Refusal in such cases is hit
on the head by negation of a national passport and can be rescued only by
compliance With the relevant saving provisions , in Art. 19(2), (4) or (6).

So far is plain sailing, as I see it. But the navigation into the penumbral
zone of the second category is not easy. I Supposing a lawyer or doctor,
expert or exporter, missionary or guru, has to visit a foreign country
profession-ally or on a speaking assignment. He is effectively disabled from
discharging his pursuit if passport is refused. There the direct effect, the
necessary consequence, the immediate impact of the embargo on grant of
passport (or its subsequent impounding or revocation) is the infringement of
the right to expression or profession'. Such infraction is unconstitutional
unless the relevant part of Art. 19 (2) to (6) is complied With. In dealing
with fundamental freedom substantial justification alone will bring the law
under the exceptions. National security, sovereignty, public order and public
interest must be of such a high degree as to offer a great threat. These
concepts should not be devalued to suit 734 the hyper-sensitivity of the
executive or minimal threats to the State. Our, nation is not so pusillanimous
or precarious as to fall or founder. if some miscreants pelt stones at its
fair face from foreign countries. The dogs may bark, but the caravan will
pass. And the danger to a party in power is not the same as rocking the
security or sovereignty of the, State. Sometimes, a petulant government which
forces silence may act unconstitutionally to forbid criticism from far, even
if necessary for the good of the State. The perspective of free criticism with
its limits for free people everywhere, all true patriots will concur, is
eloquently spelt out by Sir Winston Churchill on the historic censure motion
in the Commons as Britain was reeling under defeat at the hands of Hitlerite
hordes :

> "This long debate has now reached its final stage. What a remarkable example
> it, has been of the unbridled freedom of our Parliamentary institutions in
> time of war Everything that could be thought of or raked up has been used to
> weaken confidence in the Government, has been used to prove that Ministers
> are incompetent and to weaken their confidence in themselves, to make the
> Army distrust the backing it is getting from the civil power, to make
> workmen lose confidence in the weapons they are striving so hard to, make,
> to present the Government as a set of non-entities over whom the Prime
> Minister towers, and then to undermine him in his own heart, and, if
> possible, before the eyes of the nation. All this poured out by cable and
> radio to all parts of the world, to the distress of all our friends and to
> the delight of all our foes I am in favour of this freedom, which no other
> country would use, or dare to use, in times of mortal peril such as those
> through which we are passing."

I wholly agree that spies, traitors, smugglers, saboteurs of the health,
wealth and survival or sovereignty of the nation shall not be passported into
hostile soil to work their vicious plan fruitfully. But when applying the
Passports Act, over-breadth hyper-anxiety, regimentation complex, and
political mistrust shall not sub-consciously exaggerate, into morbid or
neurotic refusal or unlimited impounding or- final revocation of passport,
facts which, objectively assessed, may prove tremendous trifles. That is why
the provisions have to be read down into constitutionality, tailored to fit
the reasonableness test and humanised by natural justice. The Act will survive
but the order shall perish for reasons so fully set out by Shri Justice
Bhagwati. And, on this construction, the conscience of the Constitution
triumphs over vagarious governmental orders. And, indeed, the learned Attorney
General (and the Additional Solicitor General who appeared with him), with
characteristic and commendable grace and perceptive and progressive realism,
agreed to the happy resolution of the present dispute in the manner set out in
my learned brother's judgment.

A concluding caveat validating my detour. Our country, its hopes, all its
tears and all its fears, must never forget that freedom is recreated year by
year, that freedom is as freedom does, that we have gained a republic 'if we
can keep it' and that the water-

735

shed between a police state and a people's raj is located partly through its
passport policy. Today, a poor man in this poor country despaire of getting a
passport because of invariable police enquiry, insistence on property
requirement and other avoidable procedural obstacles. And if a system of
secret informers, police dossiers, faceless whisperers and political tale-
bearers conceptualised 'and institutionalised 'in public interest,' comes to
stay, civil liberty is legisidally constitutionalised--a consumption
constantly to be resisted. The merits of a particular case apart, the policing
of a people's right of exit or entry is fraught with peril to liberty unless
policy is precise, operationally respectful of recognised values and
harassment proof. Bertrand Russel has called attention to a syndrome the
Administration will do well to note :

> "We are all of us a mixture, of good and bad impulses that prevail in an
> excited crowd. There is in most men an impulse to persecute whatever is felt
> to be 'different'. There is also a haired of any claim to superiority, which
> makes the stupid many hostile to the intelligent few. A motive such as fear
> of communism affords what seems a decent moral excuse for a combination of
> the heard against everything in any way exceptional. This is a recurrent
> phenomenon in human history. Wherever it occurs, its results are horrible."

(Foreword by Bertrand Russel to Freedom is as Freedom Does-Civil Liberties
Today-by Corliss Lament. New York, 1956) While interpreting and implementing
the words of Art. 14, 19 and 21, we may keep J. B. Preistley's caution :

> "We do not imagine that we are the victims of plots, that bad men are doing
> all this. It is the machinery of power that is getting out of sane control.
> Lost in its elaboration, even some men of goodwill begin to forget the
> essential humanity this machinery should be serving. They are now so busy

(Introduction by H. H. Wilson, Associate Professor of Political Science,
Princeton University to Freedom is as Freedom Does by Corriss Lament, ibid p.
xxi.) I have divagated a great deal into travel constitutionality in the
setting. of the story of the human journey, even though such a diffusion is
partly beyond the strict needs of this case. But judicial travelling, like
other travelling. is almost like 'talking with men of other centuries and
countries.' I agree with Sri Justice Bhagwati, notwithstanding this
supplementary.

KAILASAM, J.-This petition is filed by Mrs. Maneka Gandhi under Article 32 of
the Constitution of India against the Union of India 736 and the Regional Pass
port Officer for a writ of certiorari for calling for the records of the case
including in particular the order dated July 2, 1977 made by the Union of
India under section 10(3) (c) of the Passports Act, Act 15 of 1967, impounding
the passport of the petitioner and for quashing the said order.

The petitioner received a letter dated July 2, 1977 on July 4, 1977 informing
her that it had been decided by the Government of India to impound her
passport. The letter read as follows "You may recall that a passport no.
K-869668 was issued to you by this office, on 1-6-76. It has been decided by
the Government of India to impound your above passport under section 10(3) (c)
of the Passport Act, 1967 in public interest.

You are hereby required to surrender your passport K-869668 to this office
within seven days from the date of the receipt of this letter."

On July 5, 1977 the petitioner addressed a letter to the second respondent,
Regional Transport Officer, requesting him to furnish her a copy of the
statement of the reasons for making the impugned order. On July 7, 1977 the
petitioner received the following communication from the Ministry of External
Affairs:

> "The Government has decided to impound your passport in the interest of
> general public under section 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act, 1967\. It has
> further been decided by the Government in the interest of general public not
> to furnish you a copy of statement of reasons for making such orders as
> provided for under section 10(5) of the Passports Act, 1967."

The petitioner submitted that the order is without jurisdiction and not 'in
the interests of general public.' The validity of the order was challenged on
various grounds. It was submitted that there was contravention of Art. 14 of
the Constitution, that principles of natural justice were violated; that no
opportunity of hearing as implied in section 10(3) of the Act was given and
that the with-holding of the reasons for the order under section 10(5) is not
justified in law On July 8, 1977 the petitioner prayed for an exparte ad
interim order staying the operation of the order of the respondents dated July
2, 1977 and for making the order of stay absolute after hearing the
respondents. On behalf of the Union of India, Shri N. K. Ghose, I.F.S.,
Director (P.V.) Ministry of External Affairs, filed a counter affidavit. It
was stated in the counter affidavit that on May 11, 1977, the Minister of
External Affairs approved the impounding of the passport of 11 persons and on
May 19, 1977 an order was passed by the Minister impounding the passports of 8
persons out of 11 persons that on July 1, 1977 the authorities concerned
informed the Ministry of- Ex- ternal Affairs that the petitioner and her
husband had arrived at Bombay on the after-noon of July 1, 1977 and that
information bad been received that there was likelihood of the petitioner
leaving the country. The authorities contacted the Ministry of External
Affairs 737 and Minister after going through the relevant papers approved the
impounding of the passport of the petitioner on the evening of July 1, 1977 in
the interests of general public under Section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act,
1967. On July 2, 1977 Regional Transport Officer on instructions from the
Government of India informed the- petitioner about the Central Government's
decision to impound her passport in public interest and requested her to
surrender her passport. In the counter affidavit various allegations made in
the petition were denied and it was stated that the order was perfectly
justified and that the petition is without merits and should be dismissed. The
rejoinder affidavit was. filed by the petitioner on July 16, 1977.

An application Civil Misc. Petition No. 6210 of 1977 was filed by the
petitioner for leave to urge additional grounds in support of the writ
petition and a counter to this application was filed on behalf of the Ministry
of External Affairs on August 18, 1977.

A petition by Adil Shahryar was filed seeking permission to intervene ill the
writ petition and it was ordered by this Court. During the hearing of the writ
petition, Government produced the order disclosing the reasons for impounding
the passport. The reasons given are that it was apprehended that the
petitioner was attempting or was likely to attempt to leave the country and
thereby hamper the functioning of the Commissions of Inquiry. According to the
Government, the petitioner being the wife of Shri Sanjay Gandhi, there was
likelihood of the petitioner being questioned regarding some aspects of the
Commission. In the counter affidavit it was further--alleged that there was
good deal of evidence abroad and it would be unrealistic to over-look the
possibility of tampering with it or making it unavailable to the Commission,
which can be done more easily and effectively when an interested person is
'abroad. So far as this allegation was concerned as it was not taken into
account in passing the order it was given up during the hearing of the writ
petition. The only ground on which the petitioner's passport was impounding
was that she was likely to be examined by the Commission of Inquiry and her
presence was necessary in India.

Several questions of law were raised. It was submitted that the petitioner was
a journalist by profession and that she intended to proceed to West Germany in
connection with her professional duties, as a journalist and that by denying
her the passport not only was her right to travel abroad denied but her
fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1) were infringed. The
contention was that before an order passed under Article 21 of the
Constitution could be valid, it should not only satisfy the requirements of
that article, namely that the order should be according to the procedure
established by law, but also should not in any way infringe on her fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 19(1). In other words, the submission was that
the right to personal liberty cannot be deprived without satisfying the
requirements of not only Art. 21, but also Article 19. In addition the
provisions of Section 10(3)(c) were challenged 'as being ultra vires of the
powers of the legislature and that in any event 738 the order vitiated by the
petitioner not having been given an opportunity of being heard before the
impugned order was passed. It was contended that the fundamental rights
guaranteed under Article 19(1) particularly the right of freedom of speech and
the right to practise profession was available to Indian citizens not only
within the territory of India but, also beyond the Indian territory and by
preventing the petitioner from travelling abroad her right to freedom of
speech and right to practise profession outside the country were also
infringed. The plea is that the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 19
are available not only within territory of India but outside the territory of
India as well.

The question that arises for consideration is whether the Fundamental Rights,
conferred under Part III and particularly the rights conferred under Article
19 are available beyond the territory of India. the rights conferred under
Article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (f ) and (g) are

(a) to freedom of speech and expression;

(b) to assemble peacebly and without arms;

(c) to form associations or unions;

    
    
    	      x			     x			   x
    	      x
    	      (f)   to	 acquire,   hold  and	dispose	  of
    	      property; and
    

(g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or
business;

The rights conferred under Article 19(1) (d) and (e) being limited in its
operation to the territory of India the question of their extraterritorial
application does not arise.

In order to decide this question, I may consider the various provisions of the
Constitution, which throw some light on this point. The preamble to the
Constitution provides that the people, of India have solemnly resolved to
constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democrative Republic and
to secure to all its ciitzens:

> Justice, social, economic and political; Liberty of thought, expression,
> belief faith and worship;

> Equality of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all,.

Fraternity assuring the, dignity of the individual and the, unity of the
nation.

By the article, India is constituted as a Democratic republic and its citizens
secured certain rights. While- a reading of the article would indicate that
the articles are applicable within the territory of India, the question arises
whether they are available beyond the territorial limits of India.

Article 12 of the Constitution defines "the State" as including the Government
and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the
States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or
under the control of the Government  739 of India. Article 13 provides that
laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of Fundamental Rights are to
that extent void. Article 13(1) provides, that all laws in force in the
territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution,
in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III shall, to
the extent of such inconsistency, be void. What are the laws in force in the
territory of India immediately before the commencement ,of the Constitution
that are referred to in the Article will have to be looked into. Before that
Article 13(2) may be noticed which provides that the State shall not make 'any
law which takes away or abridges the rights. conferred by Part III, and any
law made in con- travention of this clause shall, to the extent of the
contravention, be void. The word "law" in the Article is defined as:

> (a) "law" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation,
> notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of
> law; and

> (b) "laws in force" includes laws passed or made by a Legislature or other
> competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of
> this Constitution and not previously repealed, notwithstanding that any such
> law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in
> particular areas.

While the applicability of the custom and usage is restricted to the territory
of India "law" may have an extra-territorial application.

In distributing the legislative powers between the Union and the 'States
Article 248 provides that Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part
of the territory of India and the Legislature of a 'State may make laws for
the whole or any part of the State. Article 245(2) provides that no law made
by parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have
extra-territorial operation. This article makes it clear that a State law
cannot have any extra-territorial operation while that of the parliament can
have. The Parliament has undoubted power to enact law having extra-territorial
application. In England section 3 of the Statute of Westminster, 1931 (22 Geo.
V.C.4) provides :

> "It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion has
> full power to make laws having extraterritorial operation."

But in determining whether the provisions of a Constitution or a ,statute have
extra-territorial application certain principles are laid down. Maxwell on The
Interpretation of Statutes Twelfth Edition, at p. 169, while dealing with the
territorial application of British legislation has stated :-

> "It has been said by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that : 'An
> Act of the Imperial Parliament today, unless it provides, otherwise, applies
> to the whole of the United Kingdom and to nothing outside the United  740

Lord Denning M. R. has said that the general rule is "that an Act of
Parliament only applies to transactions within the United Kingdom and not to
transactions outside." These two extracts are from two decisions (1) Att. Gen.
for Alberta vs. Huggard Assets, Ltd., (1953) A.C. 420 and C.E.B. Draper & Son,
Ltd. vs. Edward Turner & Son. Ltd. (1964) 3 All. E.R. 148 at p. 150 Maxwell
comments on the above passages thus "These statements, however, perhaps
oversimplify the position." The decisions cited will be referred to in due
course.

Craies on Statute Law (Sixth Ed.) at p. 447 states that an Act of the
legislature will bind the subjects of this realm, both within the kingdom and
without, if such is its intention. But whether any particular Act of
parliament purports to bind British subjects abroad will always depend upon
the intention of the legislature which must be gathered from the language of
the Act in question." Dicey in his Introduction to the Study of the Law of the
Constitution (1964 Ed.) at page lin states the position thus : "Parliament
normally restricts the operation of legislation to its own territories,
British ships wherever they may be being included in the ambit of
territory.-Parliament does on occasions, however, pass legislation controlling
the activities of its own citizen when they are abroad." Salmond in his book
on Jurisprudence (Twelfth Ed.) distinguishes between the territorial
enforcement of law and the territoriality of law itself. At p. 11 the author
states : "Since territoriality is not a logically necessary part of the idea
of law, a system of law is readily conceivable the application of which is
limited and determined not by reference to territorial considerations, but by
reference to the personal qualifications of the individuals over whom
jurisdiction is exercised." According to the text-books above referred to, the
position is that a law is normally applicable within the territory, but can be
made applicable to its citizens wherever they may be. Whether such extra-
territorial applicability is intended or not will have to be looked for in the
legislation.

I will now refer to the decisions of courts an this subject. In Niboyet v.
Niboyet(1) the Court of Appeal stated: "It is true that the words of the
statute are general, but general word,,, in a statute have never, so far as I
am aware, been interpreted so as to extend the action of the statute beyond
the territorial authority of the Legislature. All criminal statutes are in
their terms general; but they apply only to offences committed within the
territory or by British subjects. When the Legislature intends the statute to
apply beyond the ordinary territorial authority of the country, it so states
expressly in the statute as in the Merchant Shippina Acts, and in some of the
Admiralty Acts." In the Queen v. Jameson and Others (2) the Chief Justice Lord
Russet (1) 48 L. J. P. I at p. 10.

(2) [1896] 2 Q. B. Division 425 at 430.

stated the position thus : "It may be said generally that the area within.
which a statute is to operate, and the persons against whom it is to operate,
are to be gathered from the language and purview of the particular statute. In
Cooke v. The Charles A. Vogeler Company(1), the House of Lords in dealing with
the jurisdiction of the Court of Bankruptcy observed that "English legislation
is primarily territorial, and it is no departure from that principle to say
that a foreigner coming to this country and trading here, and here committing
an act of bankruptcy, is subject to our laws and to, all the incidents which
those laws enact in such a case; while he is here, while he is trading, even
if not actually domiciled, he is liable to be made a bank- rupt like a native
citizen........ It is limited in its terms to England; and I think it would be
impossible to suppose that if the Legislature had intended so broad a
jurisdiction as is contended for here,, it would not have conferred it by
express enactment." In Tomalin v. S. Pearson & Son, Limited(2) the Court of
appeal dealing with the application of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906,
quoted with approval a passage from Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes at
p. 213 where in it was stated: "In the absence of an intention clearly
expressed or to be inferred from its language, or from the object or subject-
matter or history of the enactment, the presumption is that Parliament does
not design its statutes to operate beyond the territorial limits of the United
Kingdom". The law that is applicable in the United Kingdom is fairly summed up
in the above passage. The presumption is that the statute is not intended to
operate beyond the territorial limits unless a contrary intention is expressed
or could be inferred from its language. The decision of the Privy Council in
Att.-Gen. for Alberta v. Huggard Assets, Ltd. (8), has already been referred
to as a quotation from Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes. The Privy Council
in that case held that "An Act of the Imperial Parliament today unless it
provides otherwise, applies to the whole of the United Kingdom and to nothing
outside the 'United Kingdom: not even to the Channel Islands or the Isle of
Man, let alone to a remote overseas colony or possession." The Court of Appeal
in a later decision reported in (1964) 3 All. E.R. p. 148 (C.E.B. Draper &
Son, Ltd. vs. Edward Turner & Son, Ltd.) approved of the proposition laid down
in Att. Gen. for Alberta vs. Huggard Assets, Ltd., observing "Prima facie an
Act of the United Kingdom Parliament, unless it provides otherwise, applies to
the whole of the United Kingdom and to nothing outside the United Kingdom".

The cases decided by the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of India may be
taken note of. Dealing with the extra- territorial application of the
provisions of the Income-tax Act, the Federal Court in Governor--General in
Council v. Raleigh Investment Co. Ltd. (4) after finding that there was no
territorial operation of the Act observed that if there was any extra
territorial operation it is within the legislative powers given to tile Indian
Legislature by the Constitution Act. After discussing the case-law 'on the
subject at p. 61 regarding the making of laws for the (1) [1901] A. C. 102 at

9-119 SCI/78 742 whole or any part of British India on topics in Lists I and
III of Sch. 7 and holding that the Federal Legislature's powers for extra-
territorial legislation is not limited to the cases specified in clauses (a)
to (e) of sub-section (2) of section 99 of the Government of India Act, 1935,
concluded by stating that the extent, if any, of extra- territorial operation
which is to be found in the impugned provisions is within the legislative
powers given to the Indian Legislature by the Constitution Act. Again in
Wallace Brothers & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay, Sind and
Baluchistan(1),- the Federal Court held that there was no element of
extraterritoriality in the impugned provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act,
and even if the provisions were in any measure extraterritorial in their
effect, that was not a ground for holding them to be ultra vires the Indian
Legislature. In Mohammad Mohy-ud-din v. The King Emperor(2), the Federal Court
was considering the validity of the Indian Army Act, 191 1. In this case a
person who was not a British subject but had accepted, a commission in the
Indian Army was arraigned before a court martial for trial for offences
alleged to have been committed by him outside British India. It was held that
section 41 of the Indian Army Act, 191 1, conferred jurisdiction on the
courtmartial to try non-British subjects for offences committed by them beyond
British India. On a construction of section 43 of the Act the Court held that
the court-martial has powers "over all the native officers and soldiers in the
said military service to whatever Presidency such officers and soldiers may
belong or wheresoever they may be serving." Repelling the contention that
there was a presumption against construing even general words in an Act of
Parliament as intended to have extra- territorial effect or authorising extra-
territorial legislation the Court observed: "The passages relied on in this
connection from Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes do not go the length
necessary for the appeIlant's case. It is true that every statute is to be
interpreted, so far as its language admits, as not to be inconsistent with the
comity of nations or with the established rules of International Law. Whatever
may be the rule of International Law as regards the ordinary citizen, we have
not been referred to any rule of International Law or principle of the comity
of nations which is inconsistent with a State exercising dis- ciplinary
control over its own armed forces, when those forces are operating outside its
territorial limits". The law as laid down by the Courts may now be summarised.
Parliament normally restricts the operation of the legislation to its own
territories. Parliament may pass legislation controlling the activities of the
citizens abroad. An intention to have extra territorial operation should be
expressed or necessarily implied from the language of the Statute. The Statute
should be so interpreted as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations
or with the established rules of international law.

It is now necessary to examine the various articles of Part III of the
Constitution to find out whether any intention is expressed to make any of the
rights available extra- territorially. The application of Article 14 is
expressly limited to the territory of India as, it lays down that "The (1)
[1945] F.C.R. 65.

(2) [1946] F.C.R. 94.

743

State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal
protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 15 relates to
prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or
place of birth, and Art. 16 deals with equality of opportunity in matters of
public employment. By their very nature the two Articles are confined to the
territory of India. So also Articles 17 and 18 which deal with abolition of
untouchability and abolition of titles. Before dealing with Articles 19 and 21
with which we are now concerned the other articles may be referred to in
brief. Articles 20 and 22 can have only territorial application. Articles 23
and 24 which relate to right against exploitation and Articles 25 to 28 which
relate to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation
of religion etc. prima focie are applicable only to the territory of India At
any rate there is no intention in these Articles indicating extra- territorial
application. So also articles 29 and 30 which deal with cultural and
educational rights are applicable only within the territory of India. Article
31 does not expressly or impliedly have any extra territorial appli- cation.
In this background it will have to be examined whether any express or implied
intention of extra- territorial applicability is discernible in Articles 19
and

21\. Article 19(1) (a) declares the right to freedom of speech and expression.
While it is possible that this right may have extra-territorial application,
it is not likely that the framers of the Constitution intended the right to
assemble peaceably and without arms or to form associations or unions, or to
acquire hold and dispose of property, or to practise any profession, or to
carry on any occupation, trade or business, to have any extra territorial
application, for such rights could not be enforced by the State outside the
Indian territory. The rights conferred under Art. 19 are Fundamental Rights
and Articles 32 and 226 provide that these rights are guaranteed and can be
enforced by the aggrieved person by approaching the Supreme Court or the High
Courts. Admittedly, the rights enumerated in Art. 19(1) (a), (b), (c), (f) and
(g) cannot be enforced by the State and in the circumstances there is a
presumption that the Constitution-makers would have intended to guarantee any
right which the State cannot enforce and would have made a provision
guaranteeing the rights and securing them by recourse to the Supreme Court and
the High Courts. The restriction of the right to move freely throughout the
territory of India and the right to reside and stay in any part of the
territory of India is strongly relied upon as indicating that in the absence
of such restrictions the other rights are not confined to the, territory of
India. The provisions in Art. 19 (1) (d) and (e) i.e. the right to move freely
throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of the
territory of India have historical significance. In A. K. Gopalan vs. The
State of Madras,(1) Kania C.J., said that in the right "to move freely
throughout the territory of India" the emphasis was not on the free movement
but on the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. The
intention was to avoid any restriction being placed by the States hampering
free movement (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.

744

throughout the territory of India. It is a historical fact that there were
rivalries between the various States and the imposition of restraint on
movement from State to State by some States was not beyond possibility. In the
two clauses 19 (1) (d) and (e) the right "to move freely throughout the
territory of India" and "to reside and settle in any part of the territory of
India" the "territory of India" is mentioned with the purpose of preventing
the States from imposing any restraint. From the fact that the words
"territory of India" are found in these two clauses the contention that the
other freedoms are not limited to the territory of India for their operation
cannot be accepted. In Virendra v. The State of Punjab and Another,(1) S. R.
Das, C. J., who spoke on behalf of the Constitution Bench stated : "The point
to, be kept in view is that several rights of freedom guaranteed to the
citizens by Article 19(1) are exercisable by them throughout and in all parts
of the territory of India". The view that the rights under Art. 19 (1) is
exercisable in the territory of India has not been discussed. Far from Art.
19(1) expressing any intention expressly or impliedly of extra territorial
operation the context would indicate that its application is intended to be
only territorial. The right under Art. 19(b) and (c) to assemble peaceably and
without arms and to form associations or unions could not have been intended
to have any extraterritorial application as it will not be in accordance with
the accepted principles of international law. As the rights under Articles
19(b) and (c) cannot be enforced outside India the inference, is that no
extra- territorial application was intended. So also regarding the rights
conferred under Articles 19(f) and (g) i.e. to acquire, hold and dispose of
property; and to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade
or business, would not have been intended to be applicable outside India.

It was submitted that when the Constitution was framed the founding fathers
were influenced by the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which was made in December, 1948 and they thought it fit to make the
Fundamental Rights available to the Indian citizens throughout the world. The
history of the conception of hu- man rights may be shortly traced. The main
task of the Human Rights' Commission which was set up by the United Nations
was to draw an International Bill of Rights. The Commission split this task
into two documents : a short declaration of principles and an elaborate treaty
or covenant enforcing those principles so far as practicable. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was not intended to be binding as law but to
present the main ideals of human rights and freedoms in order to inspire
everybody, whether in or out of governments, to work for their progressive
realization. The Commission finished the Declaration and it was promulgated by
the UN Assembly on December 10, 1948. The discussion about the Draft Indian
Constitution took place between February and October, 1948 and the Articles
relating to the Fundamental Rights were discussed in October, 1948, i.e.
before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated by the UN
Assembly on December 10, 1948. It is most unlikely that before the Declaration
of Human Rights was promulgated ' (1) [1958]S.C.R.308.

745

the framers of the Indian Constitution decided to declare that the Fundamental
Rights conferred on the citizens would have application even outside India.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not binding as law but was only
a pious hope for achieving a common standard for all peoples and all nations.
Article 13 of the Declaration which is material for our discussion runs as
follows : Paragraph 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and
residence with in the borders of each state. Paragraph 2. Everyone has the
right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
Paragraph 1 restricts the right of movement and residence specifically within
the borders of the country. The second, paragraph aims at securing the right
to leave any country including his own and to return to his country. The
Declaration at that stage did not have any idea of conferring on the citizens
of any country right of movement beyond borders of the State or to freedom of
speech or right to assemble outside the country of origin. Even in the
American Constitution there is no mention of right to freedom of speech or
expression as being available outside America. Regarding the right of movement
within the borders of the State it is not mentioned as one of the freedoms
guaranteed in the American Constitution but everyone in the country takes it
for granted that one can roam at will throughout the United States.

The right of a citizen to leave any country and to return to his country is
recognised in the United States. While there is no restriction on the citizen
to return to his own country the Government of the United States does place
certain restrictions for leaving the country, such as obtaining of the
passports etc. Even the right to travel outside the United States is not
unrestricted. A passport is a request by the Government which grants it to a
foreign Government that the bearer of the passport may pass safely and freely.
The passport is considered as a licence for leaving a country and an exit
permit rather than a letter of introduction. Even in America the State
Department when it issues a passport specifies that they are not valid for
travel to countries in-which the United States have no diplomatic
representation as the position of the Government is that it will not
facilitate overseas travel where it is unable to afford any protection to the
traveller. The American public particularly the news reporters are claiming
that they should be allowed to travel wherever they wish if need be without
their Government's assurance to protection. 'The right of the American citizen
to travel abroad as narrated above shows that even the right to travel outside
the country is not unfettered.

In vain one looks to the American law to find whether the citizens are granted
any right of freedom of speech and expression beyond the territory of the
United States. The First Amendment provides for freedom of speech and press
along with freedom of religion. Liberty of speech and liberty of press are
substantially identical. They are freedom to utter words orally and freedom to
write, print and circulate words. But this freedom of expression would be
meaningless if people were not permitted to gather in groups to discuss mutual
746 problems and communicate their feelings and opinions to governmental
officers. The First Amendment therefore provides that the people have the
right to assemble peaceably and petition the government for redress of
grievances. The- petition for redress can only be confined to the United
States of America. In a recent address on Human Rights Warren Christopher,
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State reproduced in Shan, October 1977, stated before
the American Bar Association in Chicago that the promotion of human rights has
become a fundamental tenet of the foreign policy of the Carter Administration.
In explaining the conception of human rights and its practice in America the
Deputy Secretary stated that the efforts should be directed to the most
fundamental and important human rights all of which are internationally
recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which the United
Nations approved in 1948. While emphasing the three categories of human rights
(1) the right to be free from the governmental violation of the integrity of
the person; (2)- the right to fulfilment of such vital needs as food, shelter,
health care and education, and (3) the right to enjoy civil and political
liberties, he stated that the freedom of thought, of religion, of assembly, of
speech, of the press, freedom of movement within the outside one's own
country; freedom to take part in government, were liberties which American
enjoy so fully, and too often take for granted, are under assault in many
places. It may be noted that while freedom of movement is referred to as both
within and outside one's own country the other rights such as freedom thought,
of religion, of assembly of speech, of press, are not stated to be available
outside one's own country. It is thus seen that except the right to movement
outside one's own country other rights are not available extra-territorially
even in America.

The fundamental rights, under Art. 19(1) of the Constitution are subject to
the restrictions that may be placed under Art. 19(2) to (6) of the
Constitution. The Fundamental Rights are not absolute but are subject to
reasonable restrictions Provided for in the Constitution itself. The
restrictions imposed are to be by operation of any existing law or making of a
law by the Legislature imposing reasonable restrictions. The scheme of the
Article, thus it while conferring Fundamental Rights on the citizens is to see
that such exercise does not affect the rights of other persons or affect the
society in general. The law made under Art. 19(2) to (6), impose restrictions
on the exercise of right of freedom of speech and expression, to assemble
peaceably without arms etc. The restrictions thus imposed, normally would
apply only within the territory of India unless the legislation expressly or
by necessary implication provides for extra-territorial operation. In the
Penal Code, under sections 3 and 4, the Act is made specifically applicable to
crimes that are committed outside India by citizen of India. Neither in Art.
19 of the Constitution nor in any of the enactments restricting the rights
under Art. 19(2) is there any provision expressly or by necessary implication
providing for extra-territorial application. A citizen cannot enforce his
Fundamental Rights outside the territory of India even if it is taken that
such rights are available outside the country.

747

In the view that a citizen is not entitled to the Fundamental Rights
guaranteed under Art. 19 outside the territorial limits of India,- the
contention of the learned counsel for the petition that by denying him the
passport to travel outside India, his Fundamental Rights like freedom of
speech and expression, to assemble peaceably, to practise profession or to
carry on occupation, trade or business are infringed, cannot be accepted. The
passport of the petitioner was impounded on the ground that her presence in
connection with the Inquiry Commission may be necessary and in the interest of
public it was necessary to do so. The impugned order does not place any
restrictions on the petitioner while she is away from India. Hence the
question whether the State could impose such restraint does not arise in this
case. As the contention was that by impounding the, passport the petitioner's
fundamental right of freedom of speech etc. outside the country was infringed,
it became necessary to consider whether the citizen had any such right.

It was strenuously contended that the Legislature by involving powers under
Art. 21 cannot deprive the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Art. 19 at any
rate within the territory of India. It win now be considered whether an Act
passed under Art. 21 should also satisfy the requirements of Art. 19.

The submission was that Art. 19 applies to laws made under Articles 20, 21 and
22 and the citizen is entitled to challenge the validity of an Act made under
Art. 21 on the ground that it affects the rights secured to him under cl. (1)
of Art. 19. Article 20(1) provides that no person shall be convicted of any
offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission
of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than
that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the
commission of the offence. Article 22 deals with protection against arrest and
detention in certain cases, that is, in respect of preventive detention. It
has been decided by this Court in Gopalan's(1) case; that in the case of
punitive detention for offences under the Penal Code, it cannot be challenged
on the ground that it infringes the right specified under Art. 19(a) to (e)
and

(g) of the Constitution of India. Kania C.J. held :

> "If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen's
> freedom of speech or expression, or his right to assemble peaceably and
> without arms etc.; the question whether that, legislation is saved by the
> relevant saving clause of Art. 19 will arise. If, however, the, legisation
> is not directly in respect of any of these subjects, but as a result of the
> operation of other legislation, for instance, for punitive or preventive
> detention, his right under any of these sub- clauses is abridged the
> question of the application of Article 19 does not arise."

(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.

748

Fazal Ali J., though he dissented from the majority view regarding the
application of Article 19 to punitive detention observed follows "The Indian
Penal Code does not primarily or .... necessarily impose restrictions on the
freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing
restrictions on the right to move freely. Its primary object is to punish
crime and not to restrict movement...... But if it (the Punishment) consists
in imprisonment there is a restriction on movement. This restraint is imposed
not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining
crime and making it punishable. The punishment is correlated directly With the
violation of some other person's right and not with the right of movement
possessed by the offender himself. In my opinion, therefore, the Indian Penal
Code does not come within the ambit of the words 'law' imposing restrictions
on the right to move freely."

The learned Judge, Justice Fazal Ali, took a different view regarding
preventive detention on the basis that it did not admit of a trial but the
order of detention rested on an apprehended and not actual danger. Regarding
punitive detention, the decision of a Bench of five Judges in H. Saha v. State
of West Bengal,(1) expressed the same view. Chief Justice Ray observed :

> "It is not possible to think that a person who is detained will yet be free
> to move or assemble or form association or unions or have the right to
> reside in any part of India or have the freedom of speech or expression.
> Suppose, a person is prosecuted of an offence of cheating and convicted
> after trial, it is not open to him to say that the imprisonment should be
> tested with reference to Art. 19 for its reasonableness. A law which
> attracts Article 19, therefore, must be such as is capable of being tested
> to be reasonable under clauses (2) to (5) of Article 19."

In the case of punitive detention, it will be open to the accused to raise all
defences that are open to him in law, such as that there have been no
violation of any law in force. Regarding punitive detention this Court in Saha
case has held that as the Constitution has conferred rights under Art. 19 and
also adopted the preventive detention to prevent the greater evil by
imperilling security, the safety of the State and the welfare of the nation,
it is not possible to think that a person who is detained will yet be free to
move or assemble or form associations etc. Applying the same reasoning, it is
contended on behalf of the state that when a person is deprived of his life or
personal liberty in accordance with the procedure established by law, he
cannot invoke to his aid any of the rights guaranteed under Art. 19 of the
Constitution of India. Whether this contention could be accepted (1) [1975] 1
S.C.R. 778.

749

or not will be examined with reference to the provisions of the Constitution
and the decisions rendered by this Court. Article 19 to 22 appear under the
title "Right to freedom". Article 19 confers freedoms on the citizens whereas
Aft. 20 to 22 are not limited to citizens but apply to all persons. Article 19
does not deal with the right to life which is dealt with under Art. 21. While
Art. 19 provides for freedoms-which a citizen is entitled to, Articles 20 to
22 restrain the State from doing certain things. Though the right to life and
personal liberty is not dealt with under Art. 19, as it is mentioned in Art.
21 though in a negative form, the right to life and personal liberty is
secured and the State can deprive it only according to the procedure
established by law. While the rights guaranteed under Art. 19(1) are subject
to restrictions that may be placed by Articles 19 (2) to (6), the right not to
be deprived of life and personal liberty is subject to its deprivation by pro-
cedure established by law. The scope of the words "personal liberty" was
considered by Mukherjea, J. in Gopalan's case (supra.) The learned Judge
observed : "Article 19 gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in
the various clauses the restrictions that may be placed upon them by law so
that they may not conflict with the public welfare or general morality. On the
other hand, Articles 20, 21 and 22 are primarily concerned with penal
enactments or other law under which personal safety or liberty of persons
would be taken away in the interest of society and the set down the limits
within which the State control should be exercised...... the right to the
safety of one's life and limbs' and to enjoyment of personal liberty, in the
sense of freedom from physical re-strain and coercion of any sort, are the
inherent birth right-. of a man. The essence of these rights consists in
restraining others from interfering with them and hence they cannot be
described in terms of "freedom" to do particular things. . . ." The words
"personal liberty" take their colour from the words "deprivation of rifle'. It
means liberty of the person, that is freedom from personal restraint. Article
21 is one of the Articles along with Articles 20 and 22 which deal with
restraint on the person. According to Dicey :

> "The right to personal liberty as understood in England means in substance a
> person's right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest or other physical
> coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification."

(Dicey's Laws of Constitution 10th Edn. page

207) In the debates relating to the drafting of the Constitution, in Art. 15
the word that was used was "liberty". The framers of the Constitution thought
that the word "liberty" should be qualified by the insertion of the word
"personal" before it for otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to
include even the freedoms already dealt with under Art. 19, 30 (which
corresponds to Art. 19 in the Constitution). The word "personal liberty" in
Article 21 is, therefore, confined to freedom from restraint of person and is
different from other rights enumerated in Article 19 of the Constitution.

750

It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that after the decision of the
Bank Nationalisation case and Bennet Colomon's case the view taken earlier by
the Supreme Court that in construing whether the deprivation of personal
liberty is valid or not the enquiry should only be confined to the validity of
the procedure prescribed without any reference to the rights conferred under
Art. 19(1) is no longer good law. The decisions bearing on this question may
now be examined.

In Gopalan's case it was held that Art. 19 dealt with the rights of the
citizens when he was free, and did not apply to a person who had ceased to be
free and had been either under punitive or preventive legislation. It was
further held that Art. 19 only applied where a legislation directly hit the
rights enumerated in the Article and not where the loss of rights mentioned in
the Article was a result of the operation of legislation relating to punitive
or preventive detention. It was also stated by Justice Mukherjea that a law
depriving the personal liberty must be a valid law which the legislature is
competent to enact within the limits of the powers assigned to it and which
does not transgress any of the Fundamental Rights the Constitution lays dawn.
The,, learned Judge explained that the reasonableness of a law coming under
Art. 21 could not be questioned with reference to anything in Art. 19 though a
law made under Art. 21 must conform to the requirements of Articles 14 and 20.
It cannot be said that it should conform to the requirements of Article 19.
The, view, thus expressed in Gopalan's case, was affirmed by the Supreme Court
in Ram Singh v. State of Delhi(1) where it was held :

> "Although personal liberty has a content sufficiently comprehensive to
> include the freedoms enumerated in Art. 19(1), and its deprivation would
> result in the extinction of those freedoms, the Constitution has treated
> these civil liberties as distinct from fundamental rights and made separate
> provisions in Art. 19 and Arts. 21 and 22 as to the limitations and
> conditions subject to which alone they could be taken away or abridged ...
> The interpretation of these Articles and their correlation was elaborately
> dealt with by the full court in Gopalan's case.

Approving the interpretation of the Articles in Gopalan's case it was held
that law which authorises deprivation of personal liberty did not fall within
the purview of Art. 19 and its validity was not to be judged by the criteria
indicated in that Article but depended on its compliance with the requirements
of Arts. 21 to 22.

This view was again affirmed in State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh,(2) where
Das, J. in approving the law laid down in Gopalan's case observed as follows
"As I explained in Gopalan's case and again in Chiranjit LaPs case 1950 SCR
869 our Constitution protects the freedom of the citizen by article 19 (1) (a)
to (1) [1951] S.C.R. 451 (2) [1952] S.C.R 889.

(e) and (g) but empowers the State, even while those freedoms last, to impose
reasonable restrictions on them in the interest of the State or of public
order or morality or of the general public as mentioned in clauses (2) to (6).
Further, the moment even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes
incompatible with and threatens the freedom of the community the State is
given power by article 21, to deprive the individual of his life and personal
liberty in accordance with procedure established by law, subject of course, to
the provisions of Art. 22.

In Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. & another v. The Union of India, & Others, (1)
the test laid down was that there must be a direct or inevitable consequence
of the measures enacted in the impugned Act, it would not be possible to
strike down the legislation as having that effect and operation. A possible
eventuality of this type would not necessary be the consequence which could be
in the contemplation of the legislature while enacting a measure of. this type
for the benefit of the workmen concerned. The test, thus applied, is whether
the consequences were "direct and inevitable" ?

In Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan v. Union of India,(2) after citing with
approval the case of Ram Singh and Express Newspapers case, it was observed :

> "It is not the form or Incidental infringement that determine the
> constitutionality of a statute in a reference to the rights guaranteed in
> Art. 19(1) but the reality and the substance........ Viewed in this way, it
> does not select any of the elements or attributes of freedom of speech
> falling within Art. 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution."

Reality and substance test was laid down in this case while, approving of the
earlier decisions when the court was considering the question whether the ban
on advertisement would affect the rights conferred under Art. 19(1) (a). The
correctness of the view as laid down in Gopalan's case and affirmed in Ram
Singh's case was doubted by Subba Rao, J. in Kochuni v. The State of
Madras(3). The learned Judge after referring to the dissenting view of Fazal
Ali, J. in Gopalan's case rejecting the plea that a law under Art. 21 shall
not infringe Art. 19(1) observed :

"The question being integrated with the dissenting view expressed by Fazal
Ali, J. we are bound by this judgment." Reliance was placed by the learned
counsel for the petitioner on the decision by this Court in Sakal Papers (P)
Ltd. and Ors. v. The Union of India. (4) The learned counsel referred to the
passage at page 5 60A (1) [1959] 1 S.C.R. 135.

(2) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 671 at page 691.

Part where it was held that "the correct approach ; in such cases should be to
enquire as to what in substance is the loss or injury caused to a citizen and
not merely what manner and method has been adopted by ,,he State in placing
the restriction and, therefore, the right to freedom, of speech cannot be
taken away with the object of taking away the business activities of the
citizen. Reference was also made to another passage at 867 where it 'was held
that the "legitimacy of the result intended to be achieved does not
necessarily imply that every means to achieve it is permissible; for even if
the end is desirable and permissible, the means employed must not transgress
the limits laid down by the constitution if they directly impinge on any of
the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It is no answer when
the constitutionality of the measure is challenged that apart from the
fundamental right infringed the provision is otherwise legal. The above
observations relied on by the learned counsel were made in a petition where
the validity of Delhi Newspapers (Price and Page) Order, 1960 which fixed the
maximum number of pages that might be published by a newspaper according to
the price charged was questioned. The order was challenged as contravening
Art. 19(1) (a) of the Constitution. The court held that the order was void as
it violated Art. 19 (I) (a) of the Constitution and was not saved by Article
19 (2). The court held that the right extended not merely to the method which
is employed to circulate but also to the volume of circulation, and the
impugned Act and order placed restraints on the latter aspect of the right as
the very object of the Act was directly against circulation and thus,
interfered with the freedom of speech and expression. At page 866, the Court
observed :

> "The impugned law far from being one, which merely interferes with the right
> of freedom of speech incidently, does so directly though it seeks to achieve
> the end by purporting to regulate the business aspect to a newspaper........
> Such a course is not permissible and the courts must be ever vigilant in
> guarding perhaps the most precious of all the freedom guaranteed by our
> Constitution."

This decision does not help us in resolving the point at issue in this case
for the court was concerned with the question whether the right of freedom of
speech was directly affected by the impugned order. The impact of legislation
under Art. 21 on the rights guaranteed under Art. 19(1) was not in issue in
the case.

The two cases which were strongly relied on by the learned counsel for the
petitioner as having over-ruled the view of Gopalan's case as affirmed in Ram
Singh's case are Bank Nationalisation Case(2) and Bennet Colomon's case.(2) In
Kharak Singh's(3) case the majority took the view that the word 'liberty' in
Art. 21 is qualified by the word 'personal' and there its content is narrower
and the qualifying adjective has been employed in order (1) [1970] 3 S.C.R.
530.

(2) [1973] 2 S.C.R. 757.

(3) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 332.

753

to avoid overlapping between those elements or incidents of liberty like
freedom of speech or freedom of movement etc. already dealt with in Art. 19(1)
and the liberty guaranteed by Art. 21 and particularly in the context of the
difference between the permissible restraints or restrictions which might be
imposed by sub clauses (2) to (6) of the, Article of the several species of
liberty dealt with in a several clauses of Article 19(1). The minority view as
expressed by Subba Rao, J. is that if a person's fundamental right under Art.
21 is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action; but that
cannot be a complete answer unless the State laws satisfy the test laid down
in Article 19(2) as far the attributes covered by Article 19(1) are concerned.
In other words, the State must satisfy that petitioners fundamental rights are
not infringed by showing that the law only imposes reasonable restrictions
within the meaning of Art. 19(2) of the Constitution. The submission of the
learned counsel for the petitioner is that the view as ,expressed by Subba
Rao, J. has been affirmed by the subsequent decisions in the Bank
Nationalisation(1) case and Bennet Colomon(2) case.

On 19th July, 1969, the acting President promulgated an ordinance No. 8 of
1969 transferring to and vesting the undertaking of 14 names commercial banks
in the corresponding new bank under the ordinance. Subsequently, the
Parliament, enacted Banking Companies (Acquisition of Transfer of Undertaking)
Act, 1969. The object of the Act was to provide for the acquisition and
transfer of the undertakings of certain banking companies in conformity with
the national policy and objectives and for matters corrected therewith and
incidental thereto. The petitioners before the Supreme Court who held shares
in some of the named banks or had accounts current or fixed deposits in the
banks challenged the validity of the enactment. In the petitions under Art. 32
of the Constitution the validity of the Ordinance and the Act was questioned
on various grounds. I am concerned with ground no. 3 which runs as follows :
Article 19(1) (f) and Art. 31(2) are not mutually exclusive and the law
providing for acquisition of property for public purpose could be tested for
its validity on the ground that it imposes limitation on the right to property
which were not reasonable; so tested the provision of the Act transferring
undertaking of the named banks and prohibiting practically from carrying
banking business violates the guarantee under Art. 19(1) (f) and (g). In
dealing with this contention, the court held that Articles 19 (1) (f) and
Article 31 (2) are not mutually exclusive. The court observed that the
principle underlying the opinion of the majority in Gopalan's case was
extended to the protection of the freedom in respect of property and it was
held that Art. 19(1) (f) and 31(2) were mutually exclusive in their operation
and that substantive provisions of law relating to acquisition of property
were not liable to be challenged on the ground that it imposes unreasonable
restrictions on the right to hold pretty. After mentioning the two divergent
lines of authority, the court held that "the guarantee under Art. 31 (1) and
(2) arises out of the limitations imposed on the authority of the State, (1)
[1970] 3 S.C.R. 530.

(2) [1973] 2S.C.R.757.

754

by law, to take over the individual's property. The true character of the
limitation of the two provisions is not different. Clause (1) of Article 19
and clause (1) and (2) of Art. 31 are part of the similar article 19(1) (f)
enunicating the object specified and Article 19(1) and 31 deal with the
limitation which may be placed by law subject to which the rights may be
exercised. Formal compliance with the conditions of Art. 31(2) is not
sufficient to negative protection of guarantee to the rights to property. The
validity of law which authorises deprivation of property and the law which
authorises compulsory acquisition of the property for a public purpose must be
adjudged by the application of the same test. Acquisition must be under the
authority of a law and the expression law means a law which is within the
competence of the legislature and does not impair the guarantee of the rights
in Part 111. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that on similar
reasoning it is necessary that an enactment under Art. 21 must also satisfy
the requirements of Article 19 and should be by a law which is within the
competence of the legislature and does not impair the guarantee of the rights
in part III including those conferred under Art. 19 of the Constitution of
India. The important question that arises for consideration is whether the
decision in the Bank Nationalisation case has over-ruled the decision of
Gopalan's case and is an authority for the proposition and an act of the
legislature relating to deprivation of life and personal liberty should also
satisfy the other fundamental rights guaranteed under Art. 19(1) of the
Constitution.

In order to determine what exactly is the law that has been laid down in Bank
Nationalisation Case, it is necessary to closely examine the decision
particularly from pages 570 to 578 of 1970(3) SCR. After holding that :

> "Impairment of the right of the individual and not the object of the State
> in taking the impugned action, is the measure of protection. To concentrate
> merely on power of the State and the object of the State action in
> exercising that power Is therefore to ignore the true intent of the
> Constitution."

the Court proceeded to observe that "the conclusion in our judgment is
inevitable that the validity of the State action must be adjudged in the light
of its operation upon rights of individual and groups of individuals in all
their dimensions." Having thus held the Court proceeded to state :

> "But this Court has held in some cases to be presently noticed that Art. 19
> (1) (f) and Art. 31 (2) are mutually exclusive."

It is necessary at this stage to emphasize that the Court was only considering
the decisions that took the view that Article 19 (1 ) (f) and 31(2) were
mutually exclusive. After referring to passages in A. K. Gopalan's case at
pages 571 to 573 noted at page 574 :

> "The view expressed in A. K. Gopalan's case was reaffirmed in Ram Singh and
> others v. State of Delhi(1)".

(1) [1951] S.C.R. 451.

755

Having thus dealt with the passages in the judgment in Gopalan's case the
Court proceeded to consider its effect and observed that the principle
underlying the judgment of the majority was extended to the protection of
freedom in respect of property and it was held that-Article 19(1) (f) and.
Art. 31(2) were mutually exclusive in their operation. While observations in
judgment of Gopalan's case as regards the application of Art. 19(1) (f) in
relation to Art. 21 were not referred to, the Court proceeded to deal with the
correctness of the principle in Gopalan's case being extended to the
protection of the freedom in respect of property. In A. K. Gopalan's case
(supra) Das, J., stated that if the capacity to exercise the right to property
was lost, because of lawful compulsory acquisition of the subject of that
right, the owner ceased to have that right for the duration of the incapacity.
In Chiranjit Lal Chowduri's case,(1) Das, J. observed at page 919 :

> ". . . the right to property guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) (f) would......
> continue until the owner was under Art. 31 deprived of such property by
> authority of law."

Das, J. reiterated the same view in The State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal,
(2) where he observed :

> "Art. 19(1) (f) read with Art. 19(5) pre- supposes that the person to whom
> the fundamental right is guaranteed retains his property over or with
> respect to which alone that right may be exercised.

Thus the observation in Gopalan's case extending the principle laid down in
the majority judgment to. freedom in respect of property was reiterated by
Das, J. in Chiranjit Lal Chowduri's case (supra) and Subodh Gopal's case. The
principle was given more concrete shape in State of Bombay v. Bhanjit Munji(3)
case wherein it was held that "if there is no property which can be acquired
held or disposed of,. no restriction can be placed on the exercise of the
right to acquire, hold or dispose it of, and as clause (5) contemplates the
placing of reasonable restrictions of the exercise of those rights it must
follow that the Article postulates the existence of property over which the
rights are to be exercised." This view was accepted in the later cases Dabu
Barkya Thakur v. State of Bombay(4) and Smt. Sitabati Debi and Anr. v. State
of West Bengal.(5) The Court proceeded further after referring to some cases
to note that. "With the decision in K. K. Kochuni's case(6) there arose two
divergent lines of authority (1) "authority of law" in Art. 31 (1) is liable
to be tested on the ground that it violates other fundamental rights and
freedoms including the right to bold property guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (f) and
(2) "authority of law" within the meaning of Art. 31(2) is not liable to be
tested on the ground that it impairs the guarantee of Art. 19(1) (f) in so far
as it imposes substantive restrictions (1) [1950] S.C.R. 869.

(2) [1954] S.C.R. 587.

(3) [1955] (1) S.C.R. 777.

(4) [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128.

(5) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 940.

(6) [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887.

756

though it may be tested on the ground of impairment of other guarantees."
Later in the decision of State of Madhya Pradesh. v. Ranoiro Shinde(1) the
Supreme Court opined that the validity of law in cl. (2-) of Art. 31 may be
adjudged in the light of Art. 19 (1) (f). But the Court in that case did not
consider the previous catena of authorities which related to the inter--
relation between Art. 31(2) and Art. 19 (1) (f).

In considering the various decisions referred to regarding the interrelation
of Art. 31 (2) and Art. 19 (1) (f) the Court proceeded to express its view
that "the theory that the object and form of the State action determine the
extent of protection which the aggrieved party may claim is not consistent
with the constitutional scheme. Each freedom has different dimensions." Having
so stated the Court considered the inter-relation of Art. 31 (2) and Art. 19
(1) (f) and held :

> "The true character of the limitations under the two provisions is not
> different. Clause (5) of Art. 19 and cls. (1) & (2) of Art. 31 are parts of
> a single pattern; Art. 19(1) (f) enunciates the basic right to property of
> the citizens and Art. 19(5) and cls. (1) & (2) of Art. 31 deal with
> limitations which may be placed by law, subject to which the rights may be
> exercised."

It must be noted that basis for the conclusion is that Art. 19 and cl. ( 1 and
(2) of Art. 31 are parts of a single pattern and while Art. 19(1) (f)
enunciates the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property; cl. (5) of Art.
19 authorise imposition of restrictions upon the right. There must be
reasonable restriction and Art. 31 assures the right to property and grants
protection against the exercise of the authority of the State and cl. (5) of
Art. 19 and cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 31 prescribe restrictions upon State
action, subject to which the right to property may be exercised. The fact that
right to property guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (f) is subject to restrictions
under Art. 19(5) and 31 and thereby relate to the right to property closely
inter-related cannot be overlooked for that formed the basis for the
conclusion. After referring to the various Articles of the Constitution the
Court observed :

> "The enunciation of rights either express or by implication does not follow
> uniform pattern. But one thread runs through them; they seek to protect the
> rights of the individual or group of individuals against infringement of
> those rights within specific limits. Part III of the Constitution weaves a
> pattern of guarantees delimit the protection of those rights in their allot
> fields; they do not attempt to enunciate distinct rights."

It proceeded "We are therefore unable to hold that the challenge to the
validity of the provisions for acquisition is liable to be tested only on the
ground of non-compliance with Art. 31(2). Article 31(2) requires that property
must be acquired for a public purpose and that it must be acquired (1) [1968]
3 S.C.R. 489.

757

under a law with characterstics set out in that Articles. Formal compliance of
the condition of Art. 31(2) is not sufficient to negative the protection of
the guarantee of the right to property."

After expressing its conclusion, the Court proceeded to state that it is found
necessary to examine the rationale of the two lines of authority and determine
whether there is anything in the Constitution which just fies this apparently-
inconsistent development of the law. While stating that in its judgment the
assumption in A. K. Gopalanan's case that certain articles exclusively deal
with specific matters and in determining whether there is infringement of the
individual's guaranteed rights, the ob- ject and the form of State action
alone need be considered, and effect of laws on fundamental rights of the
individuals in general will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct. To this
extent the Court specifically over ruled the view that the object and form of
the State action alone need be considered. It proceeded "We hold the validity
"of law" which authorities deprivation of property and "a low" which
authorises compulsory acquisition of property for public purpose must be
adjudged by the application of the same tests." It will thus be seen that the
entire discussion by the Court in Bank Nationalisation case related to the
inter- relation between Art. 31(2) and Art. 19(1) (f). In dealing with the
question the Court has no doubt extracted passages from the judgments of
learned Judges in Gopalan's case but proceeded only to consider the extension
of the, principle underlying the majority judgment to the protection of the
freedom in respect of property, particularly, the judgment of Justice Das.
After stating that two views arose after Kochuni's case the Court concerned
itself only in determining the rationale of the two lines of authority. The
view taken in Gopalan's case that the objection and the form of State action
has to be considered was over ruled and it was laid down that it is the effect
and action: upon the right of the person that attracts the jurisdiction of the
Court to grant relief. It is no doubt true that certain passing observations
have been made regarding the liberty of persons, such as at page 576 :

> "We have carefully considered the weighty pronouncements of the eminent
> judges who gave shape to the concept that the extent of protection of
> important guarantees such as the liberty of person, and right to property,
> depends upon the form and object of State action and not upon its direct
> operation upon the individual's freedom."

Though the liberty of person is incidentally mentioned there is no further
discussion on the subject. While undoubtedly Bank Nationalisation case settles
the law that Art. 19(1)

(f) and Art. 31(2) are not mutually exclusive there is no justification for
holding that the case. is authority for the proposition that the legislation
under Art. 21 should also satisfy all the fundamental rights guaranteed under
Art.. 19(1) of the Constitution. As emphasised earlier Art. 19 (1) (f) and
Art. 31 (2) form a single pattern and deal with right to property. The
fundamental right under Art. 19(1) (f) is restricted under Art. 19(5) or Art.
31 (2) and as the article refer to right to property they are so closely
interlinked, and cannot be held to be mutually exclusive. But Art. 21 is
related to deprivation of life and personal liberty and it has been held 758
that it is not one of the rights enumerated in Art. 19(1) and refers only to
personal rights as are not covered by Article 19.

The decision in Bank Nationalisation case so far as it relates to Articles
19(1) and 21, is in the nature of obiter dicta. Though it is a decision of a
Court of 11 Judges and is entitled to the highest regard, as the Court had not
applied its mind and decided the specific question and as is in the nature of
a general, casual observation-on a point not calling for decision and not
obviously argued before it, the case cannot be taken as an authority on the
proposition in question. The Court cannot be said to have declared the law on
the subject when no occasion arose for it to consider and decide the question.

It may also be noted that as the Court ruled that the impugned Act violated
Art. 31 (2) by not laying down the necessary principles, the decision of the
inter-relationship between Art. 19(1) (f) and 31(2) was not strictly necessary
for the purpose of giving relief to the petitioner. We are not concerned in
this case as to whether the decision in Bank Nationalisation case is in the
nature of Obiter dicta so far as it held that Arts. 19(1) and 31(2) are
interrelated. But it is necessary to state that the decision proceeded on some
erroneous assumptions. At page 571 of flank Nationalisation case (supra) it
was assumed. "The Majority of the Court (Kania, C.J. and Patanjali Sastri,
Mahajan, Mukherjea & Das JJ.) held that Art. 22 being a complete code relating
to preventive detention the validity of an order of detention must be
determined strictly according to the terms and within the four comers of that
articles." This statement is not borne out from the text of the judgment$ in
Gopalan's case. At p. 115 of Gopalan's case (supra) Kania C.J. has stated :
"The learned Attorney General contended that the- subject of preventive
detention does not fall under article 21 at au and is covered wholly by
article 22. According to him, article 22 is a complete code. I am unable to
accept that contention." Patanjali Sastri J. at page 207 of the judgment said
: "The learned Attorney General contended that article 22 clauses (4) to (7)
formed a complete code of constitutional safeguards in respect of preventive
detention, and, provided only these provisions are conformed to, the validity
of any law relating to preventive detention could not be challenged. I am
unable to agree with this view". Das J. in referring to the Attorney General's
argument at page 324 stated : "that article 21 has nothing to do with
preventive detention at all and that preventive detention is wholly covered by
article 22(4) to (7) which by themselves constitute a complete code. I am
unable to accede to this extreme point of view also." Mukherjea J. at p. 229
of that judgment observed : "1t is also unnecessary to enter into a discussion
on the question raised by the learned Attorney- General as to whether article
22 by itself is a self- contained Code, with regard to the law of preventive
detention and whether or not the procedure it lays down is exhaustive."
Justice Mahajan at page 226 held that "I am satisfied on a review of the whole
scheme of the Con- stitution that the intention was to make article 22 self-
contained in respect of the laws on the subject of preventive detention." It
is thus seen that the assumption in Bank Nationalisation's case that the
majority of the Court held that article 22 is a complete code is erroneous and
the basis of the decision stands shaken. If the obiter dicta based 759 on the
wrong assumption is to be taken as the correct position in law, it would lead
to strange results. If arts. 19(1) (a) to (e) and (g) are attracted in the
case of deprivation of personal liberty under art. 21, a punitive detention
for an offence committed under the Indian Penal Code such as theft, cheating
or assault would be illegal as pointed out in Gopalan's case by Kania C.J. and
Patan ' jali Sastri J. for the reasonable restriction in the interest of
public order would not cover the offences mentioned above. As held in
Gopalan"s case and in Saha's case there can be no distinction between punitive
detention under the Penal Code, and preventive detention. As pointed out
earlier even though Fazal Ali J. dissented in Gopalan's case, the same view
was expressed by His Lordship so far as punitive detention was concerned. He
said : "The Indian Penal Code does not primarily or necessarily impose
restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it
is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely." The conclusion
that art. 19 (1) and Art. 21 were mutually exclusive was arrived at on an
interpretation of language of art. 19 (1) (d) read with art. 19(5) and not on
the basis that art. 19(1) and 21 are exclusive and Art. 21 a complete code.
The words "Personal liberty" based on the Draft Committee report on Art. 15
(now Art. 21) was added to the word 'personal' before the word 'liberty' with
the observation that the word 'liberty' should be qualified by the word
'personal' before it for otherwise it may be construed very wide so as to
include even the freedoms already dealt with in Art. 13 (now Art. 19). In
Gopalan's case it was also pointed out by the Judges that art. 19(1) and 21
did not operate on the same field as Art. 19(1) and 31(2) of the Constitution
are. The right under Art. 21 is different and does not include the rights that
are covered under art. 19. Art. 19(1) confers substantive right as mentioned
in clauses. (a) to (g) on citizen alone and does not include the right of
personal liberty covered in Art.

21\. For the reasons stated above obiter dicta in Bank Nationalisation's case
that a legislation under art. 21 should also satisfy the requirements of Art.
19(1) cannot be taken as correct law. The Court has not considered the
reasoning in Gopalan's case and over-ruled it. Before proceeding to consider
the test of validity of a legislation as laid down in Bennet Colomon's case
following the Bank Nationalisation ,case the decisions which followed the Bank
Nationalisation case holding on the erroneous premises that the majority in
Gopalan's case held that Article 22 was a self-contained Code. may be shortly-
referred to. In S. N. Sarkar v. West Bengal(1), the Supreme Court held that in
Gopalan's case the majority Court held that Article 22 was a self-contained
Code and, therefore, the law or preventive detention did not have to satisfy
the requirement of Articles 19, 14 and 20. In the Bank Nationalisation case
the aforesaid premise in Gopalan was disapproved and; therefore, it no longer
holds the field. Though the Bank Nationalisation case dealt with in relation
to Article 19 and 31, the basic approach considering the fundamental rights
guaranteed in-the different provisions of the Constitution adopted in this
case held the major pre- mises of the majority in the Gopalan case was
erroneous. The view taken in this case also suffers from the same infirmities
referred to in (1) [1973] 1 S.C.C. 856.

760

Bank Nationalisation case. Later, in the case of Khundiran v. West Bengal(1),
a Bench of four Judges again erroneously stated that Gopalan's case had taken
the view that Article 22 was a complete Code. After referring to Bank
Nationalisation case and S. N. Sarkar's and to the case of H. Saha v. State of
West Bengal(2) the Court regarded the question as concluded and a final seal
put on this controversy and hold'that in view of the decision, it is not open
to any one now to contend that the law of preventive detention which falls in
Article 22 does not have to meet the requirement of Art. 14 or Art. 19."

In Additional District Magistrate v. S. S. Shukla,(3) the locus standi to move
a habeas corpus petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India while
the Presidential order dated 27th June, 1975 was in force fell to be
considered. The Court while holding that the remedy by way of writ petition to
challenge the legality of an order of detention under the Maintenance of
Internal Security Act is not open to a detenu during the emergency, had
occasion to consider the observations made by the majority in Bank
Nationalisation case regarding the application of Art. 21 of the Constitution
of India. Chief Justice Ray, at page 230 held :

> "Article 21 is our rule of law regarding life and liberty. No, other rule of
> law can have separate existence as a distinct right. The negative language
> of fundamental right incorporated in Part III imposes limitations on the
> power of the State and declares the corresponding guarantee of the
> individual to that fundamental right. The limitation and guarantee are
> complimentary. The limitation of State action embodied in a fundamental
> right couched in negative form is the measure of the protection of the
> individual."

After quoting with approval the view held in Kharak Singh's case that
,personal liberty in Art. 21 includes all varieties of rights which go to make
personal liberty other than those in Art. 19(1), the learned Judge observed
that the Bank Nationalisation case merely brings in the concept of reasonable
restriction in the law. Justice Beg, as he then was, considered this aspect a
little more elaborately at page 322. After referring to the passage in Bank
Nationalisation case the learned Judge observed :

> "It seems to me that Gopalan's case was merely cited in Cooper's case for
> illustrating a line of reasoning which was held to be incorrect in
> determining the validity of 'law' for the acquisition of property solely
> with reference to the provisions of Art. 31. The question under
> consideration in that case was whether Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 (2) are
> mutually exclusive."

The learned Judge did not understand the Cooper's case as holding that effect
of deprivation of rights outside Art. 21 will also have to (1) [1975] 2 S.C.C.

be considered. Justice Chandrachud understood the decision in Bank
Nationalisation case as holding that Art. 21 and Art. 19 cannot be treated as
mutually exclusive. Justice Bhagwati at page 433 of the reports took the view
that in view of the decision of this Court in Cooper's case the minority view
in Kharak Singh's case that the law under Art. 21 must also satisfy the test
laid down in Art. 19(1) so far the attributes covered by Art. 19(1) are
concerned was approved. It is seen that the view taken in the Bank
Nationalisation case that a law relating to deprivation of life and personal
liberty falling under Art. 21 has to meet the requirements of Art. 19 is due
to an error in proceeding on the basis that the majority Court in Gopalan's
case held that Article 22 was a self contained code. The decisions which
followed Bank Nationalisation case, namely, the case of S. N. Sarkar v. West
Bengal and Khundiram v. West Bengal, H. Saha v. West Bengal, suffer from the
same infirmity. With respect I agree with the view expressed by Chief Justice
Ray and Justice Beg, as be then was, in Shukla's case.

Next to Bank Nationalisation case strong reliance was placed on Bennet
Colomon's case by the, petitioner for the proposition that the direct effect
of the legislation of the fundamental rights is the test.

In the case the petitioners impugned the new newsprint policy on various
grounds. The Court held that though Article 19(1)(a) does not mention the
freedom of press, it is settled view of the Court that freedom of speech and
expression includes freedom of press and circulation. Holding that the
machinery of import control cannot be utilised to control or curb circulation
or growth of freedom of newspapers it was held that Newspapers Control Policy
is ultra-vires of the Import Control Act and the Import Control Order. The
Court after referring to the two tests laid down in Bank Nationalisation case
observed : "Direct operation of the Act upon the right forms the real test".
The question that was raised in the case was whether the impugned newsprint
policy is in substance a newspaper control. The, Court held that the Newsprint
Control Policy is found to be Newspaper Control Order in the, guise of framing
an import control policy fog newsprint. As the direct operation of the Act was
to abridge the freedom of speech and expression, the Court held that the pith
and substance doctrine does not arise in the present case. On the facts of the
case there, was no need to apply the doctrine of pith and substance It may be
noted that in Bennet Colomon's case the question whether Articles 21 and 19
are mutually exclusive or not did not arise for consideration and the case
cannot be taken as an authority for the question under consideration in the
case. Bennet Colomon's case, Express Newspapers case, Sakal Newspapers case
were all concerned with the right to freedom of the press which is held to
form part of freedom of speech and expression.

Whether the pith and substance doctrine is relevant in considering the
question of infringement of fundamental rights, the Court observed at page 780
of the Bank Nationalisation case "Mr. Palkhivala said that the tests of pith
and substance of the subject matter and of direct 762 and of incidental effect
of the legislation are relevant to question of legislative competence but they
are irrelevant to the question of infringement of fundamental rights. In our
view this is a sound and correct approach to interpretation of legislative
measures and State action in relation to fundamental rights." It is thus
clear, that the test of pith and substance of the subject matter and of direct
and incidental effect of legislation is relevant in considering the question
of infringement of fundamental right.

The Court at page 781 said : "by direct operation is meant the direct
consequence or effect of the Act upon the rights and quoted with approval the
test laid down by the Privy Council in Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of
New South Wales.(1) In deciding whether the Act has got a direct operation of
any rights upon the fundamental rights, the two tests are, therefore, relevant
and applicable. These tests have been applied in several cases before the
decision in Bank Nationalisation case. A reference has been made to the
decision of Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. and Anr. V. Union of India,(2) where
the test laid down was that there must be a direct and inevitable consequence
of the legislation. In Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of, India(3) this Court
followed the test laid down in Express Newspapers case. The Court expressed
its view that it is not the form or incidental infringement that determine
constitutionality of a statute but reality and substance' In Sakal Papers (P)
Ltd. v. Union of India(4) it was held that the "Correct approach in such cases
should be to enquire as to what in substance is the loss or injury caused to
the citizen and not merely what manner and method have been adopted by the
State in placing the restriction. The: Supreme Court in some cases considered;
whether the effect of the, operation of the legislation is direct and
immediate or not. If it is remote, incidental or indirect, the validity of the
enactment will not be effected. The decision in Copper's case has not rejected
the above test. The test laid down in cooper's case is the direct operation on
the rights of the person.

The test was adopted and explained in Bennet Colomon's case as pointed above.

The view that pith and substance rule is not confined in resolving conflicts
between legislative powers is made clear in the decision of the Federal Court
in Subramaniam Chettiar's case,(5) where Vardachariar, J. after referring
briefly to the decision of Gallagher V. Lynn,(6) held that "They need not be
limited to any special system of federal constitution is made clear by the
fact hat in Gallagher V. Lynn, Lord Atkin applied pith and substance rule when
dealing with a question arising under the Government of Ireland Act which did
not embody a federal system at all." (1) [1950] A. C. 235.

The passport Act provides for issue of passports and travel documents for
regulating the departure from India of citizens of India and other persons. If
the provisions comply with the requirements of Article 2 1, that is, if they
comply with the procedure established by law the validity of the Act cannot be
challenged. If incidentally the Act infringes on the rights of a citizen under
Art. 19(1) the Act cannot be found to be invalid. The pith and substance rule
will have to be applied and unless the rights are directly affected, the
challenge will fail. If it is meant as being applicable in every case however
remote it may be where the citizen's rights under Art. 19(1) are affected,
punitive detention will not be valid. The result of the discussion, therefore,
is that the validity of the Passport Act will have to be examined on the basis
whether it directly and immediately infringes on any of the fundamental right
of the petitioner. If a passport is refused according to procedure established
by law, the plea that his other fundamental rights are denied cannot be raised
if they are not directly infringed. The decisions of the Supreme Court wherein
the right of person to travel abroad has been dealt with may be noticed. In
Satwant Singh v. Assistant Passport Officer, Delhi(1) the Court held that
though a passport was not required for leaving, for practical purposes no one
can leave or enter into India without a passport. Therefore, a passport is
essential for leaving and entering India. The Court held the right to travel
is part of personal liberty and a person could not be deprived of it except
according to the procedure laid down by law. The view taken by the majority
was that the expression "personal liberty" in Article 21 only excludes the
ingredients of liberty enshrined in Art. 19 of the Constitution and the
exression 'personal liberty' would take in the right to travel abroad. This
right to travel abroad is not absolute and is liable to be restricted
according to the procedure established by law. The decision has made it clear
that "personal liberty" is 'not one of the rights secured under Article 19
and, therefore, liable to be restricted by the legislature according to the
procedure established by law. The right of an American citizen to travel is
recognised. In Kent v. Dulles,(2) the Court observed that the right to travel
is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due
process of law under the Fifth Amendment. "The freedom of movement across the
frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, as a part of our
heritage, Travel abroad, like travel within the country...... may be as close
to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or
reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values." In a subsequent
decision--Zemel v. Rusk(3) the Court sustained against due process attacks the
Government's refusal to issue passports for travel to Ouba because the refusal
was grounded on foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens. "The
requirements of due process are a function not only of the extent of the
governmental restriction imposed, but also of the extent of the necessity for
the restriction."

(The Constitution of the United States of America-Analysis and interpretation-
at page 1171) In Herbert Aptheker etc. v. Secretary of State,(1) the Court
struck down a congressional prohibition of international travel by members of
the Communist Party. In a subsequent decision the Court upheld the
Government's refusal to issue passports for travel to Cuba, because the
refusal was on foreign policy consideration affecting all citizens [Zenel v,
Rusk (supra)]. Thus an American's citizen's right to travel abroad may also be
restricted under certain conditions. Our Constitution provides for restriction
of the rights by 'procedure established by law'. It will be necessary to
consider whether the impugned Act, Passport Act satisfies the requirements of
procedure established by law. The procedure established by law does not mean
procedure, however, fantastic and oppressive or arbitrary which in truth and
reality is no procedure at all [(A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras) (1)
observations of Mahajan, J.]. There must be some procedure and at least it
must confirm to the procedure established by law must be taken to mean as the
ordinary and well established criminal procedure, that is to say, those
settled usages and normal modes of proceedings, sanctioned by the Criminal
Procedure Code which is a general law of Criminal procedure in the Country.
But as it is accepted that procedure established by law refers to statute law
and as the legislature is competent to change the procedure the procedure as
envisaged in the criminal procedure cannot be insisted upon as the legislature
can modify the procedure. The Supreme Court held in Kartar Singh's case(3)
that Regulation 236 clause (b) of the U.P. Police Regulation which authorises
domiciliary visits when 'there was no law on such a regulation, violated
Article 21. I will not proceed to examine the provisions of Passport Act, Act
15 of 1967, to determine whether the Provisions of the Act are in accordance
with the procedure established by law.

The Preamble states that the Act is to provide for the issue of passports and
travel documents to regulate the departure from India of citizens of India and
other persons and for matters incidental or ancillary thereto. It may be
remembered that this Act was passed after the Supreme Court had held in
Satwant Singh V. Union of India'(1) that the right to tavel abroad is a part
of person's personal liberty of which he could not be deprived except in
accordance with the procedure established by law in terms of Article 21 of the
Constitution. The legislature came forward with this enactment prescribing the
procedure for issue of passports for regulating the departure from India of
citizens and others.

Section 5 of the Act provides for applying for passports or travel documents
etc. and the procedure for passing orders thereon. On receipt of an
application under sub-section (2) the passport authority may issue a passport
or a travel document with endorsement in respect of the foreign countries
specified in the application or issue of a pass- port or travel document with
endorsement in respect of some foreign countries and refuse to make an
endorsement in respect of other countries or to refuse to issue a passport or
travel document and to refuse to make on the passport or travel document any
endorsement. In the event of the passport authority refusing to make an
endorsement as applied for or refusal to issue a passport or a travel document
or refusal of endorsement, the authority is required to record in writing a
brief statement of its reasons and furnish to that person, on demand, a copy
thereof unless the authority for reasons specified in sub- section (3) refuses
to furnish a copy. Section 6 provides that the refusal to make an endorsement
shall be on one or other grounds mentioned in sub-sections (2) to (6). Section
8 provides that every passport shall be renewable for the same period for
which the passport was originally issued unless the passport authority for
reasons to be recorded in witing otherwise determines.

Section 10 is most important as the impounding of the passport ,of the
petitioner was ordered under section 10(3)

(c) of the Act. Section 10(1) enables the passport authority to vary or cancel
the endorsement on a passport or travel document or may with the previous
approval of the Central Government, vary or cancel the conditions subject to
which a passport or travel document has been issued, and require- the holder
of a passport or a travel document by notice in writing, to deliver up the
passport or travel document to it within such time as may be specified in the
notice. Sub-section (2) enables the bolder of a passport or a travel document
to vary or cancel the conditions of the passport.

Section 10(3) with which we are concerned runs as follows 10(3).-The passport
authority may impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a passport or travel
document,-

(a) If the passport authority is satisfied that the holder of the passport or
travel document is in wrongful possession of;

(b) If the passport or travel document was obtained by the suppression of
material information or on the basis of wrong information provided by the
holder of the passpot or travel document or any other person on his behalf;

(c) If the passport authority deems it necessary so to do in the interests of
the sovereignity and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly
relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of the
general public;

766

(d) If the holder of the passpot or travel document has, at any time after the
issue of the passort or travel document, been convicted by a court in India
for any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced in respect thereof to
imprisonment for not less than two years;

(c) If proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by
the holder of the passport or travel document are pending before a criminal
court in India;

(f) If any of the conditions of the passport or travel document has been
contravened;

(g) If the holder of the passport or travel document has failed to comply with
a notice under sub-section (1)requiring him to deliver up the same.

(b) If it is brought to the notice of the passport authority that a warrant or
summons for the appearance or a warrant for the arrest, of the holder of the
passport or travel document has been issued by a court under any law for the
time being in force or if an order prohibiting the departure from India of the
holder of the passport or other travel document has been made by any such
court and the passport authority is satisfied that a warrant or summons has
been so issued or an order has been so made."

Section 10(3) (c) enables the passport authority to impound or revoke a
passport if the passport authority deems it 'necessary so to do in the
interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India,
friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of
the general public.

Section 10(5) requires the passport authority to record in writing a brief
statement of the reasons for making an order under sub-section (1) or(3) and
to furnish the holder of the passport on demand a copy of the same unless in
any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will 'not be in the
interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the, security of India,
friendly relations of India with any foreign country or in the interests of
the general public to furnish such a copy. Section 11 provides for an appeal
by the aggrieved person against any order passed by the passport authority
under several clauses mentioned in sub- section (1) of that section. It is
also provided that no appeal shall lie against any order passed by the Central
Government. Section 11(5) provided that in disposing of an appeal, the
appellate authority shall follow such procedure as may be prescribed and that
no appeal shall be disposed of unless the appellant has been given a
reasonable opportunity of representing his case. Rue 14 of the Passport Rules,
1967 prescribes that the appellate authority may call for the records of the
case from the authority who passed the order 767 appealed against and after
giving the appellant a reasonable opportunity of representing his case pass
final orders. To sum up under section 10(3) (c) if the passport authority
deems it necessary so to do for reasons stated in the subsection, he may
impound a passport. He is required to record in writing a brief statement of
'the reasons for making such order and to furnish a copy of the order on
demand unless in any case he thinks for reasons mentioned in sub-section (5)
that a copy should not be. furnished. Except against an order passed by the
Central Government the aggrieved person has a right of appeal. The appellate
authority is required to give a reasonable opportunity to the aggrieved person
of representing his case. It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that on
a reading of section 10(3) observance of rules of natural justice, namely the
right to be heard, is implied and as the Government had failed to give an
opportunity to the petitioner to explain her case the order is unsustainable.
In the alternative it was submitted that if section 10(3)

(c) is construed as denying the petitioner an opportunity of being heard and
by the provisions of section 11 a right of appeal against an order passed by
the Central Government is denied the provisions will not be procedure as
established by law under Article 21 and the relevant sections should be held
ultra vires of the powers of the legislature. It was contended that the power
conferred on the authority to im- pound a passport in the interests of general
public is very vague and in the absence of proper guidance an order by the
authority impounding the passport "in the interests of general public" without
any explanation is not valid. The last ground may easily be disposed of. The
words 'in the interests of general public' no doubt are of a wide connotation
but the authority in construing the facts of the case should determine whether
in the interests of public the passport will have to be impounded. Whether the
reasons given have annexus to the interests of general public would depend
upon the facts of each case. The plea that because of the vagueness of the
words 'interests of the general public' in the order, the order itself is
unsustainable, cannot be accepted.

The submission that in the context the rule of natural justice, that is, the
right to be beard has not been expressly or by necessary implication taken
away deserves careful consideration. Under Section 10(3) the passport
authority is authorised to impound or revoke a passport on any of the grounds
specified in clauses (a) to (h) of sub- section (3). Sub-section 3(a) enables
the authority to impound a passport if the bolder of the passport is in
wrongful possession thereof. Under sub-section 3(b) the authority can impound
a passport if it was obtained by the suppression of material information or on
the basis of wrong information provided by the holder of the passport. Under
clause (d) a passport can be impounded if the holder bad been convicted by a
Court of India for any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to
imprisonment for not less than two years. Under clause (e) the passport can be
impounded where 768 proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been
committed by the holder of a passport is pending before a criminal court in
India. Clause (f) enables the authority to impound the passport if any of the
conditions of the passport have been contravened. Under clause (g) the
passport authority can act if the holder of the passport had failed to comply
with a notice under sub-section (1) requiring him to deliver up the same.
Under sub-clause (h) a passport may be impounded if it is brought to the
notice of the passport authority that a warrant or summons for appearance of
the holder of the passport has been issued by any court or if there is an
order prohibiting departure from India of the holder of the passport has been
made by a court. It will be noticed that when action is contemplated under any
of the clauses (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (h), it is presumed that the
authority will give notice, for the passport authority cannot be satisfied
under sub-clause (a) that the holder is in wrongful possession thereof or
under clause (b) that he obtained the passport by suppression of material
information. Similarly under clause

(d) whether a person has been convicted by a court in India for any offence
involving moral turpitude and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two
years, can only be ascertained after hearing the holder of the passport. Under
clause (e) the fact whether proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to
have been committed by the holder of the passport are pending before a
criminal court can only be determined after notice to him. Equally whether a
condition of passport has been contravened under sub-clause (f) or whether he
has failed to comply with a notice under sub- section (1) can be ascertained
only after hearing the holder of the passport. Under clause (h) also a hearing
of the holder of the passport is presumed. Reading clause (c) in juxtaposition
with other 'Sub-clauses, it will have to determined whether it was the
intention of the legislature to deprive a right of hearing to the holder of
the passport before it is impounded or revoked. In this connection, it cannot
be denied that the legislature by making an express provision may deny a
person the right to be heard. Rules of natural justice cannot be equated with
the Fundamental Rights. As held by the Supreme Court in Union of India v. J.
N. Sinha,(1) that "Rules of natural justice are not embodied rules nor can
they be elevated to the position of Fundamental Rights. Their aim is to secure
justice or to prevent miscarriage of justice.These rules can operate only in
areas not covered by any law validly made. They do not supplant the law but
supplement it. If a statutory provision can be read consistently With the
principles of natural justice, the courts should do 'so. But if a statutory
provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the
application of any rules of natural justice then the court cannot ignore the
mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read into the
concerned provision the principles of natural justice." So also the right to
be heard cannot be presumed when in the circumstances of the case there is
paramount need for secrecy or when a decision will have to be taken in
emergency or when promptness of action is called for where delay would defeat
the very purpose or where it is expected (1) [1971] 1 S.C.R. 791.

769

that the person affected would take an obstructive attitude. To a limited
extent it may be necessary te rovoke or to impound a passport without notice
if there is real apprehension that the holder of the passport may leave the
country if he becomes aware of any intention on the part of the passport
authority or the Government to revoke or impound the passport. But that by
itself would not justify denial of an opportunity to the holder of the
passport to state his case before a final order is passed. It cannot be
disputed that the legislature has not by express provision excluded the right
to be heard. When the passport authority takes action under section 10(5) he
is required to record in writing a brief statement of reasons and furnish a
copy to the holder of the passport on demand unless he for sufficient reasons
considers it not desirable to furnish a copy. An order thus passed is subject
to an appeal where an appellate authority is required to give a reasonable
opportunity to the holder of the passport to put forward his case. When an
appeal has to be disposed of after given for a specified period the revocation
or impounding during the without hearing the aggrieved person. Further when a
passport is given for a specified period the revocation or impounding during
the period when the passport is valid can only be done for some valid reason.
There is a difference between an authority revoking or modifying an order
already passed in favour of a person and initially refusing to grant a
licence. In Purtabpur Co. v. Cane Commissioner, Bihar,(1) the Supreme Court
held that "it would not be proper to equate an order revoking or modifying a
licence with, a decision not to grant a licence." In Schmidt v. Secretary of
State, Home Affairs,(2) Lord Denning observed that "If his permit (alien) is
revoked before the time limit expires he ought, I think, to be given an
opportunity of making representation; for he would have a legitimate
expectation of 'being allowed to stay for the permitted time." Lord Denning
extended the application of the rule of audi alteram partem even in the case
of a foreign alien who had no right to enter the country. When a permit was
granted and was subsequently sought to be revoked it has to be treated
differently from that of refusing permission at the first instance. As in the
present case the passport which has been granted is sought to be impounded the
normal presumption is that the action will not be taken without giving a
opportunity to the holder of the passport. Section 10(3) in enumerating the
several grounds on which the passport authority may impound a passport has
used the words like 'if the authority is satisfied', "the authority deems it
necessary to do so." The Privy Council in Durav- appah V. Fernando(3) after
referring to an earlier decision in Sugathadasa v. Jayasinghe(4) disagreed
with the decision holding "As a general rule that words such as 'where it
appears to . . . .' or 'if it appears to the satisfaction of..... or 'if the
considers it expedient that. . . .' or 'if the .... is satisfied that. . .
standing by themselves without other words or circumstances of qualification,
exclude a duty to act judicially." The Privy Council in disagreeing with this
approach observed (1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 807.

(2) [1969] 2 Ch. 149.

(3) [1967] 2 A. C. 337, (4) [1958] 59 N.L.R. 457.

770

that these various formulae are introductory of the matter to be considered
and are given little guidance upon the question of audi alteram partem. The
statute can make itself clear on this point and if it does cadit quaestio. If
it does not then the principle laid down in Cooper v. Wardsworth Board of
Works(1) where Byles, J. stated "A long course of decision, beginning with Dr.
Bentley's case, and ending with some very recent cases, establish, that
although there are no positive words in the statute requiring that the party
shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of
the legislature." In the circumstances, there is no material for coming to the
conclusion that the right to be heard has been taken away expressly or by
necessary implication by the statute. I may at this stage refer to the stand
taken by the learned Attorney-General on this question. According to him "on a
true construction, the rule audi alteram partenm is not excluded in ordinary
cases and that the correct position is laid down by the Bombay High Court in
the case of Minoo Maneckshaw v. Union of India.( 2 ) The view taken by
Tulzapurkar, J. is that the rule of audi alteram partem is not excluded in
making an order under sec. 10(3) (c) of the Act. But the Attorney General in
making the concession submitted that the rule will not apply when special
circumstances exist such as need for taking prompt action due to the urgency
of the situation or where the grant of opportunity would defeat the very
object for which the action of impounding is to be taken. This position is
supported by the decision of Privy Council in De Verteuil v. Knaggs,(3)
wherein it was stated 'it must, however, be borne in mind that there may be
special circumstances which would satisfy a Governor, acting in good faith, to
take action even if be did not give an opportunity to the person affected to
make any relevant statement, or to correct or controvert any relevant
statement brought forward to his prejudice." This extraordinary step can be
taken by the passport authority for impounding or revoking a passport when he
apprehends that the passport holder may leave the country and as such prompt
action is essential. These observations would justify the authority to impound
the passport without notice but before any final order is passed the rule of
audi alteram partem would apply and the holder of the passport will have to be
beard. I am satisfied that the petitioner's claim that she has a right to be
heard before a final order under s. 10(3) (c) is passed is made out. In this
view the question as to whether sec. 10(3) (c) is ultra vires or not does not
arise.

it was submitted on behalf of the state that an order under subclause 10(3)
(c) is on the subjective satisfaction of the passport authority and that as
the decision is purely 'administrative in character it cannot be questioned in
a court of law except on very limited grounds. Though the courts had taken the
view that the principle of natural justice is inapplicable to administrative
orders, there 'is a change in the judicial opinion subsequently. The frontier
between judicial or (1) 1723 1 Str. 557 ; Mod. Rep. 148.

(3) [1918] A. C 557 771 quasi judicial determination on the one hand and an
executive or administrative determination on the other has become blurred. The
rigid view that principles of natural justice applied only to judicial and
quasi judicial acts and not to administrative acts no longer holds the field.
The views taken by the courts on this subject are not con- sistent. While
earlier decisions were in favour of administrative convenience and efficiency
at the expense of natural justice, the recent view is in favour of extending
the application of natural justice and the duty to act fairly with a caution
that the principle 'should not be extended to the extreme so as to affect
adversely the administrative efficiency. In this connection it is useful to
quote the oft-repeated ,observations of Lord Justice Tucker in Russell v. Duke
of Norfolk(1) "The requirements of natural justice must depend on the
circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which
the tribunal is acting , the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so
forth .... but, whatever standard is adopted, one essential is that the person
concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case." In R.
v. Gaming Board Ex. p. Benaim,(2) Lord Denning held that the view that the
principle of natural justice applied only to judicial proceedings and not to
administrative proceedings has been over-ruled in Ridge v. Baldwin.(3) The
guidance that was given to the Gaming Board was that they should follow the
principles laid down in the case of immigrants namely that they have no tight
to come in, but they have a right to be heard. The Court held in construing
the words the Board "Shall have regard only" to the matter specified, the
Board has a duty to act fairly and it must give the applicant an opportunity
of satisfying them of the matter specified in the section. They must let him
know what their impressions are so that he can disabuse them. The reference to
the cases of immigrants is to the decisions of Chief Justice Parker in Re H.
K. (An infant)(1). In cases of immigrants though they had no right to come
into the country it was held that they have a right to be heard. These
observations apply to the present case and the plea of the petitioner that the
authority should act fairly and that they must let her know what their
impressions are so that, if possible, she can disabuse them, is sound. In
American law also the decisions regarding the scope of judicial review is not
uniform. So far as constitutional rights are involved due process of law
imports a judicial review of the action of administrative or executive
officers. This proposition is undisputed so far as the questions of law are
concerned but the extent to which the Court should go and will go in reviewing
determinations of fact has been a highly controversial issue. (Constitution of
the United States of America, P. 1152, 1973 Ed.) On a consideration of various
authorities it is clear that where the decision of the authority entails civil
consequences and the petition is (1) [1949] 1 All E.R.109,118.

prejudicially affected he must be given an opportunity to, be heard and
present his case. This Court in Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board(1)
and Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. S. D. Agrawal,(2) has held that a limited
judicial scrutiny of the impugned decision on the point of rational and
reasonable nexus was open to a court of law. An order passed by an authority
based on subjective satisfaction is liable to judicial scrutiny to a limited
extent has been laid down in U.P. Electric Co. v. State of U.P.(3) wherein
construing the provisions of s. 3(2)(e) of the Indian Electricity Act 9 of
1910 as amended by the U.P. Act 30 of 1961, where the language used is similar
to s. 10(3) (c) of the Passport Act, this Court held that when the Government
exercises its power on the ground that it "deems such supply necessary in
public interest" if challenged, the Government must make out that exercise of
the power was necessary in the public interest. The Court is not intended to
sit in appeal over the satisfaction of the Government. If there is prima facie
evidence on which a reasonable body of persons may hold that it is in the
public interest to supply energy to consumers the, requirements of the statute
are fulfilled. "In our judgment, the satisfaction of the Government that the
supply is necessary in the public interest is in appropriate cases not
excluded from judicial review." The decisions cited are clear authority for
the proposition that the order passed under s. 10(3) (c) is subject to a
limited judicial scrutiny. An order under s. 10(3) (c) though it is held to be
an administrative order passed on the subjective satisfaction of the authority
cannot escape judicial scrutiny. The Attorney General fairly conceded that an
order under S. 10 (3) (c) is subject to a judicial scrutiny and that it can be
looked into by the court to the limited extent of satisfying itself whether
the order passed has a rational and reasonable nexus to the interests of the
general public.

It was next contended on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of s.
10(5) of the Act which empowers the Passport authority or the Government to
decline furnishing the holder of the passport a brief statement of the reasons
for making an order if the authority is of the opinion that it will not be in
the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of India,
friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of
the general public is unsustainable in law. It was submitted that along with
the right to refuse to furnish a copy of the order made by the Government, as
a right of appeal is denied against an order made by the Central Govt. the
provisions should be regarded as. total denial or procedure and arbitrary. In
view of the construction which is placed on S. 10(3) (c) that the holder of
the passport is entitled to be heard before the passport authority deems it
necessary to impound a passport, it cannot be said that there is total denial
of procedure. The authority under s. 10(5) is bound to record in writing a
brief statement of the reasons for making an order and furnish to the holder
of the passport or travel docu-

ment on demand a copy of the same, unless in any case, the passport authority
is of the opinion that it will not be in the interests of the sovereignty and
integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relation of India with any
foreign country or in the interests of general public to furnish such a copy.
The grounds on which the authority may refuse to furnish the reasons are the
same as provided in s. 10 (3)(c) for impounding a passport but the two powers
are exercisable in totally different contexts. Under sec. 10(3), the question
that has to be considered is whether the passport has to be impounded in the
interests of sovereignty and integrity of India etc. or in the interests of
general public. In passing an order under sec. 10(5) it has to be considered
whether in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India etc. or in
the interests of general public, furnishing of a copy of the reasons for the
order, should be declined. Though the same grounds are mentioned for
impounding a passport as well as for refusing to furnish the reasons for
making an order, it would not mean that when an order under s. 10(3) (c) is
passed it would automatically apply to s. 10(5) and for the same reason the
authority can decline to furnish the reasons for the order. S. 10(5) says that
the authority shall furnish to the holder of the passport on demand a copy
unless in any case the authority it of opinion that it will not be in the
interests of sovereignty and integrity of India etc. The expression "unless in
any case" would indicate that it is not in every case that the authority can
decline to furnish reasons for the order. There may be some, cases, and I feel
that it can be only in very rare cases, that a copy containing the reasons for
making such order can be refused. Though rare there may be some cases in
which: it would be, expedient for the authority to decline to furnish a copy
of the reasons for making such order. But that could only be an exception is
indicated from the fact that the aggrieved person has a right of appeal under
s. 1 1 which has to be decided after giving a reasonable opportunity of
representing his case. A reasonable opportunity cannot Ordinarily be given
without disclosing to that person the reasons for the order. In those rare
,cases in which a copy for the reasons of the order is declined by the
passport authority and is not furnished during the hearing of the appeal, it
would furnish sufficient justification for the courts to have a close look
into the reasons for the order and satisfy itself whether it has been properly
made. But I am unable to, say that a provision which empowers the authority to
decline to furnish reasons for making the order is not within the competence
of the legislature. The learned counsel for the petitioner, with some
justification, submitted that if no reasons we furnished by the Govt. and no
appeal is provided against the order of the Govt. it would virtually amount to
denial of procedure established by law as contemplated under Art. 21 of the
,Constitution of India. Though there is considerable force in this submission.
I am unable to accept this plea for two reasons. Firstly, the Govt. is bound
to give an opportunity to the holder of the passport before finally revoking
or impounding it. I expect the case in which the authority declines to furnish
reasons for making such an order would be extremely rare. In such cases it
should be born in mind that when the Govt. itself passes an order it should be
presumed that it would have made the order after careful scrutiny. If an order
is passed 11-119 SCI/79 774 by the passport authority, an appeal is provided.
If the Govt. passes an order, though no appeal is provided for, but as the
power is vested in the highest authority the section is not
unconstitutional--(Chinta Lingam and Ors. v. Government of India & ors.(1) for
the order would be subject to judicial scrutiny by the High Court and the
Supreme Court. I feel that in the circumstances there is no justification for
holding that S. 10(5) of the Act is ultra vires of the powers of the
legislature. We have taken note of the fact that in the present case there is
no reason in declining to furnish to the petitioner the statement of reasons
for impounding the passport but such a lapse by the authority would not make
sec. 10(5) ultra vires of the powers of the legislature.

It was next contended that in the present case the passport was impounded
under S. 10(3) (c) of the Act on the ground that (a) it is in the public
interest that Smt. Maneka Gandhi should be able to give evidence before the
Commission of 'Inquiry and, (b) that Smt. Maneka Gandhi should have an
opportunity to present her views before the Commission of Inquiry and
according to a report received there is likelihood of Smt. Maneka Gandhi
leaving India. It was submitted that impounding of the passport on the ground
stated above is unjustified. Referring to  S. 10(3) (h) where it is provided
that when it is brought to the notice of the passport authority that a warrant
or summons for appearance or a warrant for the arrest of the holder of the
passport has been issued by a court under any law for the time being in force
or if an order prohibiting the departure from India of the holder of the
passport or other travel document has been made by any such court and the
passport authority is satisfied that a warrant or summons has been so issued
or an order has been so made, impound the passport. For application of this
clause there must be a warrant or summons from the court or an order by the
Court prohibiting the departure from India. It was submitted that it is not
certain whether the Commission would require the presence of the petitioner at
all and if required. when her. presence will be necessary. There had been no
summons or any requisition from the Commission of Inquiry requiring 'the
petitioner's presence and in such circumstances it was submitted that the
order is without any justification. A notification issued by the Ministry of
External Affairs under  s. 22(a) of the Passports Act on 14-4-76 was brought
to our notice. By that notification the Central Govt. considered that it is
necessary in the public interest to exempt citizens of India against whom
proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by them
are pending before a criminal court in India and if they produce orders from
the Court concerned permitting them to depart from India from the operations
of the provisions of clause

(f) of sub-section (2) of s. 6 of the Act subject to the condition that the
passport will be issued to such citizen only for, a period specified in such
order of the Court and if no period is.specified the passport shall be issued
for a period of six months and may be renewed for a further period of six
months if the order of the (1) [1971] 2 S.C.R. 871 at p. 876.

court is not cancelled or modified. The citizen is also required to give an
undertaking to the passport authority that he shall, if required by the court
concerned, appear before if at any time during the continuance in force of the
passport so issued. It was submitted that when such facility is provided for a
person who is being tried for an offence in a criminal court the same facility
at least should be given to a person who may be required to give evidence
before a Commission of Inquiry. It is unnecessary for me to go into the
question as to whether in the circumstances the impounding of the passport is
justified or not for the' learned Attorney General submitted that the im-
pounding was for the purpose of preventing the petitioner from leaving the
country and that a final decision-as to whether the passport will have to be
impounded and if so for what period will be decided later. On behalf of the
Government a statement was filed which is as follows "1. The Government is
agreeable to considering any representation that may be made by the petitioner
in respect of the impounding of her passport and giving her an opportunity in
the matter. The opportunity will be given within two weeks of the receipt of
the representation. It is clarified that in th e present case, the grounds for
impounding 'the passport are those mentioned in the affidavit in reply dated
18th August, 1977 of Shri Ghosh except those mentioned in para 2(xi).

2\. The representation of the petitioner will be dealt with expeditiously in
accordance with law.

3\. In the event of the decision of impounding the passing having confirmed,
it is clarified that the duration of the impounding will not exceed a period
of six months from the date of the decision that may be taken on the
petitioner's representation.

4\. Pending the consideration of the petitioner's represen- tation and until
the decision of the Government of India thereon, the petitioner's passport
shall remain in custody of this Honourable Court.

5\. This will be without prejudice to the power of the Government of India to
take such action as it may be advised in accordance with the provisions of the
Passport Act in respect of the petitioner's passport."

In view of the statement that the petitioner may make a representation in
respect of impounding of passport and that the representations will be dealt
with expeditiously and that even if the impounding of the passport is
confirmed it will not exceed a period of six months from the date, of the
decision that may be taken on the petitioner's repre- sentation, it is not
necessary for me to go into the merits of the case any further. The Attorney
General assured us that all the grounds 776 urged before us by the petitioner
and the grounds that may be urged before the authority will be properly
considered by the authority and appropriate orders passed. In the result, I
hold that the petitioner is not entitled to any of the fundamental rights
enumerated-in Article 19 of the Constitution and that the Passport Act
complies with the requirements of Art. 21 of the Constitution and is in
accordance with the procedure established by law. I construe section 10(3)(c)
as providing a right to the holder of the passport to be heard before the
passport authority and that any order passed under section 10(3) is subject to
a limited judicial scrutiny by the, High Court and the Supreme Court.

In view of the statement made by the learned Attorney General to which
reference has already been made in judgment, I do not think it necessary to
formally interfere with the impugned order. I accordingly dispose of the Writ
Petition without passing any formal order. There will be no order as to costs.

ORDER Having regard to the majority view, and, in view of the statement made
by the learned Attorney-General to which reference, has already been made in
the judgments we do not think it necessary to formally interfere with the
impugned order. We, accordingly, dispose of the Writ Petition without passing
any formal order. The passport will remain in the custody of the Registrar of
this Court until further orders. There will be no order as to costs.
