as a tactical move, the application was withdrawn on 10th April, 2018;
(xxxviii) to work around the rejection of the application to import and market
the new VSL#3 as a drug, CD Group launched the same as a probiotic food in
India under the brand VSL#3 in the year 2018; (xxxix) that while marketing new
VSL#3 as a probiotic food under the brand VSL#3, the defendants are inducing
public, authorities and professionals to believe that their product is the
same as De Simone Formulation which was sold as drug under the same brand i.e.
VSL#3; (xl) the defendants have retained the same trade dress and are
publicizing the new VSL#3 as the same as De Simone Formulation, earlier sold
under the said trade mark and are also on their website, relying upon study
done of effect of VSL#3 formulation on children with severe sepsis; (xli)
though earlier the defendants were, on their packaging, claiming the new VSL#3
to be having seven strains of bacteria, to go give false sense of similarity
with the original VSL#3 De Simone Formulation, they have now started claiming
that new VSL#3 contains eight strains of bacteria; (xlii) in any case, the new
VSL#3 does not have same strain in same proportion as in De Simone
Formulation; (xliii) that new VSL#3 is not merely a probiotic food but is a
drug as defined in Section 2(b) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940; (xliv) the
defendants cannot sell and market their new product under the brand VSL#3 or
under any other brand identical or deceptively similar thereto; (xlv) the new
VSL#3 is marketed as a probiotic food, to cause deception and confusion
amongst buyers, traders and medical practitioners at the risk of health of
patients; (xlvi) untested probiotic carries serious risks; and, (xlvii)
various other litigations are pending in India also between the plaintiffs and
the defendants.

2\. On the aforesaid pleas, the reliefs of (i) permanent injunction to
restrain the defendants from manufacturing, importing, advertising, selling,
offering to sell and stocking their new product or any other formulation
amounting to drug without getting appropriate approval from DCGI; (ii)
permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from manufacturing their new
product or any other formulation amounting to drug under the brand VSL#3 or
under any other brand identical or deceptively similar thereto; and, (iii)
permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from linking / relating their
new product to plaintiff no.1 or to De Simone Formulation or to tests,
research, studies conducted with respect to De Simone Formulation and
ancillary reliefs thereto, have been claimed.

3\. The suit came up first before this Court on 14 th November, 2019, when
after noticing in brief aforesaid pleadings of the plaintiffs, the following
order was passed:

> "2. A perusal of the plaint did not show the plaintiffs to have asserted any
> individual civil right in this suit.

> 3\. The case of the plaintiffs is, (i) that the plaintiffs held a patent in
> USA and the term of which patent has expired; (ii) that the patented product
> was being sold by the plaintiff under the brand "VSL#3"; (iii) that on
> expiry of patent, the plaintiffs have entered into Know-How Transfer
> Agreements with others with respect to the same patented product and the
> said product is now being sold under the brand VISBIOME and VIVOMIXX; (iv)
> that the defendants are selling a different product that is deceptively
> similar to the plaintiff's and though the defendants had applied for drug
> license but withdrew the application on objection being taken by the
> plaintiffs; and, (v) that now the defendants are selling the product without
> any permission from the DCGI.

> 4\. I have straightaway enquired from the senior counsel for the plaintiffs
> whether not this suit, for enforcement of laws, CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 7 of 24
> rather than for asserting any individual civil right, is barred by Section 4
> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 which provides that specific relief can be
> granted only for the purpose of enforcing individual civil right and not for
> mere purpose of enforcing a penal law.

> 5\. The senior counsel for the plaintiffs requests for matter to be taken up
> tomorrow to enable him to study the said aspect.

> 6\. List on 15th November, 2019."

4\. On 15th November, 2019, the senior counsel then appearing for the
plaintiffs stated that the plaint was required to be amended and sought
adjournment therefor.

5\. Though the plaintiffs thereafter filed IA No.16443/2019 for amendment of
the plaint but the counsel for the plaintiffs, on 2nd December, 2019 argued
dehors the application for amendment and contended that the plaintiffs, in
prayer no.3 as under of the existing plaint are asserting a personal civil
right:

> "(iii) Pass a decree of permanent injunction restraining defendants from
> directly or indirectly linking / relating CD Product (described in paras 30
> and 41 of plaint) to plaintiff No.1 or to De Simone Formulation (described
> in para 3 of plaint) or to tests, researches, studies conducted on De Simone
> Formulation or to treatment guidelines published for De Simone Formulation."

6\. Inter alia the following order was passed on 2nd December, 2019:

> "3. The counsel for the plaintiffs, during the course of his contentions has
> clarified that though the relief of permanent injunction restraining the
> passing off is claimed, but not on the basis of similarity/deceptive
> similarity of trade mark but on the plea of unjust enrichment. It has
> further been clarified that the CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 8 of 24 suit is not
> asserting any right under a contract which was entered into between the
> plaintiffs and the defendants in the year 2010 i.e. prior to the expiry of
> US patent in February, 2015 but till 31st January, 2016 i.e. which was in
> operation till after about one year of the expiry of the US patent.

> 4\. The counsel for the plaintiffs has contended, (i) that if the know-how
> in which a trade secret is claimed is not disclosed in the patent, as in
> this case and the subject matter of patent and subject matter of know-how
> are distinct, then notwithstanding the lapse of the patent, the rights in
> the know-how to prevent others from making the patented product can be
> asserted; (ii) though such others may not include those who have learnt the
> know-how by reverse engineering, but would certainly include to the persons
> to whom the plaintiffs had disclosed the know- how under a contract inasmuch
> as such persons cannot take an undue advantage of such disclosure and
> confidentiality and the liabilities thereunder have to continue
> notwithstanding the expiry of patent and expiry of the agreement; (iii) that
> there can be an intellectual property in a trade secret; though such
> intellectual property is not recognized by any statute relating to
> intellectual property in India but is recognized under Section 6 of the
> Income Tax Act, 1961; and, (iv) that Section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872 is
> generally used qua employment contracts and would have no application to a
> confidentiality obligation under a know-how contract.

> 5\. The counsel for the plaintiffs to, in a tabular form, set out the
> differences between the patent and the know-how and to, on the next date of
> hearing, with the assistance of a note running into not more than 15 pages,
> address on the following aspects: (I) that there can be a patent without
> disclosing of know-how for making the patented product;

> (II) that after the expiry of the patent, the patentee can restrain others
> from relying upon tests, researches, studies conducted on the patented
> product or treatment guidelines published for the patented product;

> (III) the effect of the patent being confined to US and the plaintiffs not
> having any patent even in India;

CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 9 of 24

> (IV) the enforcement of rights in intellectual property other than that
> statutorily recognized in the Trade Marks Act, 1999, Copyright Act, 1957,
> Designs Act, 2000, Patents Act, 1970 and Protection of Plant Variety and
> Farmers Rights Act, 2001; (V) whether there can be a patent in law, without
> disclosure of the know-how, for others to make the patented product after
> the expiry of the term of the patent;

> (VI) whether not enforcement of such rights as claimed would be in violation
> of Section 27 of the Contract Act; and, (VII) can there be any tort in India
> contrary to the statutory law of India viz. Section 27 of the Contract Act.

> 6\. Attention of the counsel for the plaintiffs is also drawn to Modicare
> Ltd. Vs. Gautam Bali & Ors 2019 SCC OnLine Del 10511\.

> 7\. List on 16th January, 2020.

> 8\. On the said date, list CS(COMM) 912/2018 and disposed of CS(OS) 552/2016
> also."

7\. The counsel for the plaintiffs was heard on 16 th January, 2020 and was
permitted to handover written submissions and has handed over written
submissions dated 18th February, 2020.

8\. It is the contention of the counsel for the plaintiffs, that (i) the suit
is primarily for passing off and unjust enrichment by seeking to sell the new
VSL#3 by relying on studies and reputation of De Simone Formulation; attention
in this regard is drawn to averments in paragraphs 25,35,40,41,42,49 and 55 of
the plaint; (ii) though the plaintiffs do not claim any ownership rights over
the mark VSL#3 under which the defendants‟ product is being sold, the primary
grievance of the plaintiffs is that the mark VSL#3 has come to be associated
with the plaintiffs De Simone Formulation owing to use thereof for sale of De
Simone Formulation for over a decade;

CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 10 of 24

(iii) the mark has thus acquired secondary significance in relation to the
said formulation and any attempt on the part of the defendants to sell their
new product under the same mark coupled with their act of placing reliance on
studies relating to De Simone Formulation, constitutes an act of passing off
and unjust enrichment which fall under the broad genus of unfair competition;
(iv) an action for passing off is essentially a tortious action which is not
limited to unregistered trade marks and applies to any act which free rides on
the work or goodwill or reputation of a third party; reliance is placed on
Ellora Industries, Delhi Vs. Banarsi Dass Goela AIR 1980 Delhi 254; (v)
business goodwill is an asset and species of „property‟; the tort of passing
off is based on economic policy, the need to encourage enterprise and to
ensure commercial stability; reliance is placed on Prina Chemical Works Vs.
Sukhdayal ILR 1974 Delhi 545; (vi) Section 4 of the Specific Relief Act
extends to enforcing a right of a party to goodwill and reputation enjoyed by
its product; (vii) the mala fide of the defendants is also evident from the
defendants using the mark, earlier used with respect to a drug, now with
respect to a food supplement; (viii) such action of the defendants is harmful
for the public and is in violation of the notification issued by the DCGI and
filed at page 695 of Part-IIIA file; (ix) even otherwise the new product is
being sold under the mark VSL#3 in USA as a medical food whereas the same is
being sold as a food supplement in India under the same mark; (x) the
plaintiffs, in US Courts had not made grievance with respect to use of the
mark VSL#3 by the defendants but only with respect to reliance by the
defendants on the studies relating to De Simone Formulation and which
grievance has been sustained and the defendants restrained from relying on
such studies or from trying to draw a nexus of their new product CS(OS)
576/2019 Page 11 of 24 with De Simone Formulation; (xi) the defendants, in
India also are relying on the studies relating to De Simone Formulation and
which is harmful to consumers interest; and, (xii) the plaintiffs here not
only have a prima facie case but a strong prima facie case, justifying not
only admission of the suit but also grant of ex parte ad-interim injunction;
reliance is placed on Mohan Rawale Vs. Damodar Tatyaba Alias Dadasaheb (1994)
2 SCC 392 to contend that the mere fact that the case is weak, is no ground
for striking it out so long as some cause of action is disclosed.

9\. I have considered the contentions of the counsel for the plaintiffs.

10\. The plaint, in my view, does not disclose any cause of action against any
of the defendants on the ground of passing off their goods as that of the
plaintiffs. My reasons therefor are as follows:

> A. The plaintiffs‟ claim De Simone Formulation, passing off whereof by the
> defendants is alleged, to be a patented product. However, the patent pleaded
> with respect to De Simone Formulation is under the laws of USA and it is not
> the case of the plaintiffs that De Simone Formulation had any patent in
> India.

> B. Unlike the intellectual property in trade marks, where the common law
> tort of passing off is statutorily recognized vide Section 27(2) of the
> Trade Marks Act, there is no common law right in an invention, as the
> plaintiffs claim De Simone Formulation to be. It is only by statute i.e. the
> Patents Act, 1970, that to give impetus to research and innovation, rights
> in CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 12 of 24 an invention are conferred but again unlike
> trade marks, for a limited period of time. It is only when a patent has been
> obtained with respect to an invention in accordance with the Patents Act
> that the inventor or the patentee entitled to prevent others, who do not
> have his consent, from the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling
> or importing the patented product or from using the patented process. Save
> as conferred by Section 48 of the Patents Act, there is no right in common
> law in any inventor to restrain others from commercially exploiting the
> invention.

> C. Reference in this regard may be made, to Entertainment Network Vs. Super
> Cassette Industries (2008) 13 SCC 30, Times Warner Entertainment Company Vs.
> RPG Netcomm 140 (2007) DLT 758 (DB), The Gramophone Company of India Vs.

> D. In Akutate Internet Services supra, in the context of a claim for
> injunction restraining the defendants from disseminating contemporaneous
> match information in the form of ball by ball account or minute to minute
> score updates/match alerts, for a premium and without obtaining licence from
> plaintiff, the CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 14 of 24 argument of defendants unfairly
> competing with the plaintiffs was rejected holding (i) that in doing so, the
> Courts would be granting protection to certain intangibles not covered by
> the specific statutory regimes; (ii) the basic economic rule is that
> competition is not only lawful but a mainspring of the economy; (iii) the
> legislature has recognized that there should be exceptions-it has laid down
> the rules for these; the laws of patents, trademarks, copyrights and designs
> have all been fashioned for the purpose; each of them have rules for their
> existence... each has their own justification; (iv) it is not for the judges
> to step in and legislate into existence new categories of intellectual
> property; (v) it is not open for the Courts to create such judicial remedies
> to remedy what the Courts consider unfair; it is not open to the Court to
> legislate in this way; (vi) recognition of a general action for "unfair
> competition" involves not more than recognition of the fact that the
> existence of such an action is inconsistent with the established limits of
> the traditional and statutory causes of action which are available to a
> trader in respect of damage caused or threatened by a competitor; those
> limits, which define the boundary between the area of legal or equitable
> restraint and protection and the area of untrammelled competition,
> increasingly reflect what the Parliament has determined to be the
> appropriate balance between competing claims and policies; (vii) neither
> legal principle nor social utility requires or warrants the obliteration of
> that boundary by the importation of cause of CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 15 of 24
> action whose main characteristic is the scope it allows, under high-sounding
> generalizations for judicial indulgence of idiosyncratic notions of what is
> fair in the market place; (viii) the recent trend internationally to accord
> protection to rights in information in varying degrees or to accept the
> doctrine of unfair competition, especially in the European Union, is
> pursuant to legislative action by the European Council, and not as a
> judicial extension; (ix) once we recognize that mere information cannot be
> the subject matter of protection under common law, it becomes apparent that
> other means continue to remain available to protect such information: by way
> of an action for breach of the common law duty of confidence, which is a
> right in personam against an individual who has come across such information
> under confidence, and crucially, is distinct from a propriety right in such
> information itself, opposable in rem; (x) there exists another cogent reason
> for denying the existence of any general misappropriation or unfair
> competition theory - i.e. that it would create a non-existent distinction
> between copying which is actionable under the Copyright Act and
> appropriation or misappropriation which is actionable under the doctrine of
> unfair competition;

> (xi) under the Copyright Act, the copying or reproduction of match
> information is permitted; to say that the doctrine of unfair competition
> prohibits the misappropriation of match information would either mean that
> misappropriation under common law can supplant the Copyright Act or that
> copying CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 16 of 24 and misappropriation refer to two
> distinct acts, which would be a distinction without a difference; (xii)
> claims based on alternate common law remedies in respect of what is in the
> domain of a statute cannot be permitted; (xiii) claim on the basis of unjust
> enrichment is the same as a claim on basis of the doctrine of unfair

> F. As is evident from the plaint, and the written submission presented on

> G. The question thus, of the plaintiffs having any rights with respect to De

> H. The counsel for the plaintiffs, being well conscious of the aforesaid

> to provide Know-How of De Simone Formulation, after knowing the Know-How
> from the plaintiffs cannot indulge in making and marketing the product as De
> Simone Formulation.

> I. The aforesaid argument overlooks that the De Simone Formulation has no
> patent in India and the plaintiff no.1, even as inventor thereof under the
> Patents Act, has no right to restrain the defendants from making or selling
> De Simone Formulation. The question which thus emerges is, whether an

> K. The counsel for the plaintiffs, as recorded in the order dated 2 nd
> December, 2019, has also sought to contend that a patent is different from
> Know-How. However, Section 7 of the Patents Act titled "Form of Application"
> requires every patent application to be accompanied with a provisional or
> complete specification and Section 10 of the Act titled "Contents of
> Specifications" requires the specification to describe the invention
> sufficiently indicate in the title the subject matter to which the invention
> relates and to fully and particularly describe the invention and its
> operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, the best
> method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and for
> which he is entitled to claim protection, to define the scope of the
> invention for which the protection is claimed, and provide technical
> information on the invention in the abstract. The position becomes clear
> from Section 25 of the Patents Act, which permits the grant of patent to be
> opposed on the ground of the complete specification furnished not
> sufficiently and clearly describing the invention or the method by which it
> is to be performed. Section 84 of the Act titled "Compulsory Licences",
> empowering the Controller of Patents to grant compulsory licence of patent
> enabling a person other than a patentee or others whom patentee has
> permitted to work the patent, is also indicative of patent, particularly the
> specifications therein, being self-sufficient to enable such person to work
> the patent even without the consent of the CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 21 of 24
> patentee. If the Know-How for manufacture of a product for which the patent
> has been obtained and which patent has lapsed was not proved in the
> specifications required to be furnished for obtaining a patent, no
> compulsory licence with respect to the said patent could have been granted
> inasmuch as compulsory licence would have been unable to work the patent
> without also knowing the other knowhow which the plaintiff no.1 claims to
> have kept to himself.

> L. In any case, information claimed to be confidential can be protected as
> trade secret only if such information is not available in the public domain
> and is hence unknown to others. Reference in this regard may again be made
> to Navigator Logistics supra, Ambience India Vs. Naveen Jain 122 (2005) DLT
> 421, Emergent Genetics Vs. Shailendra Shivam 2011 (125) DRJ 173, Tech Plus
> Media Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Jyoti Janda 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1819 and Satish Kumar
> supra. Since the plaintiffs have no subsisting patent protection in India,
> and since the patent based in US has expired, the innovation, as noted
> above, is in public domain. Hence, the claim for trade secret protection
> falls and the defendants cannot be restrained from manufacturing the
> product, in spite of the Know-How Agreement, as otherwise it would amount to
> judicial creation of an extra-statutory monopoly for perpetuity in the
> invention, in contrast to the scheme of Patent Act, 1970 that seeks to bring
> an invention to public domain after the expiry of the term of the CS(OS)
> 576/2019 Page 22 of 24 patent, and which is opposed to public interest as
> well as to judicial discipline.

> M. The plaintiff has also sought to restrain the defendants from selling
> their product under the brand name VSL#3. In this regard, however, it is
> pertinent to note that the averments in the plaint make it clear that the
> brand name VSL#3 is owned by defendant No.2. The passing off claim with
> regard to the brand name by the plaintiff is unfounded as the restraint on
> use is sought with respect to property that the plaintiffs do not own in the
> first instance.

> N. No merit is thus found in the contention of the counsel for the
> plaintiffs, of any separate property right, besides the patent, for working
> the patent.

> O. Once the plaintiff no.1, as far as India is concerned, had no right in De
> Simone Formulation without obtaining patent with respect thereto, the
> question of the plaintiff being entitled to restrain the defendants from
> working the De Simone Formulation or from claiming their product to be the
> same as De Simone Formulation does not arise. The claim of the plaintiffs of
> the defendants by so misrepresenting causing injury to the public is in
> public interest and without any personal right, the plaintiffs have no
> personal cause of action. If the plaintiffs are desirous of instituting a
> Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and are entitled to do so as per the Rules
> of this CS(OS) 576/2019 Page 23 of 24 Court, the plaintiffs will have to
> apply in a public interest forum in accordance with the rules of this Court.

> P. The reliefs claimed of permanent injunction are governed by the Specific
> Relief Act, 1963 and fall in the genre of specific relief. Section 4 of the
> said Act provides that specific relief can be granted only for the purpose
> of enforcing individual civil rights and not for the mere purpose of
> enforcing a penal law. Once the plaintiffs have not been able to show any
> individual civil right in their favour, to be entitled to restrain the
> defendants from breaching the same, the question of the plaintiffs being
> entitled to the relief of injunction, thus does not arise.

11\. The counsel for the plaintiffs has thus been unable to clear the doubts
entertained as to the very maintainability of the suit, since the day when the
suit had come up before this Court first.

12\. The suit is thus found to not disclose any cause of action for the
reliefs claimed and is dismissed.

13\. No order as to costs.

Decree sheet be drawn up.
