> Assessment Year ("AY") 2010-11 at Rs. 30,678,470 as against the returned

comparable company selected by the Appellant in the TP documentation by
modifying the filter of employee cost being less than 25% of turnover as
proposed by the Ld. TPO to employee cost of less than 75% of turnover; and
further erred in incorrectly computing the filter ratio at less than 75%
instead of correct ratio of 79.69% of turnover.

violating provisions of Rule 10B(2) by considering E-Infochips Bangalore

incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956\.

18\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. AO erred in
computing interest under section 234B of the Act.

19\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, Ld. AO erred in

3\. Grounds 1 to 15 relate to adjustment of Rs. 3,03,25,034/- to the arm's
length price of the international transaction of provision of software
development services provided by the appellant company to its holding company
M/s ION Trading UK Ltd.

4\. The factual matrix as emanating from the material on record is that the
appellant company is a wholly owned subsidiary company of M/s ION Trading UK
Ltd. It is engaged in the business of providing computer software development
services to its AE on a captive basis. In the instant assessment year, the
appellant furnished a return of income on 11.10.2010 declaring an income of
Rs. 3,53,440/-. During the year the appellant had entered into following
international transaction with its Associated Enterprise (AE):

> Sr. Type of International Method Total Value of No. Transaction Selected
> transaction 1 Computer Software Transactional 21,82,68,570 Development
> Services Net Margin Method  6 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

5\. In view of the above, AO made a reference u/s 92CA(1) to the Transfer
Pricing Officer (TPO) for determining the Arm's Length Price (ALP). In course
of proceeding before TPO, appellant submitted a TP study report. In the TP
analysis, appellant selected Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as the
most appropriate method for benchmarking the international transaction and for
the purpose of applying TNMM, the assessee company identified itself as the
tested party. Further, operating profit to operating cost (OP/OC) was
considered as the profit level indicator (PLI) to demonstrate its adherence to
the arm's length provisions contained in the Act. The PLI of the assessee was
calculated at 9.37%; whereas average PLI of the comparables was arrived at
6.48%. The calculation of the assessee's margin is as under:

    
    
                  Particulars         As on March 2010 (Amt. in Rs.)
               Operating income               22,29,50,213
                Operating cost                20,38,55,648
                Operating profit               1,90,94,565
                   OP/OC                          9.37%
    
    

It is to be noted here that while calculating the operating cost of
Rs.20,38,55,648/-, a deduction of Rs. 82,18,899/- on account of  7 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 adjustment of cost relating to rent and maintenance charges
for under-utilization of capacity was claimed by the appellant.

6\. Furthermore, the appellant had computed the PLI of the comparables by
selecting a set of 6 comparables and the margin of these was shown to be 6.48%
using the current year data as under:

7\. The TPO vide its order dated 22.01.2014, has observed that appellant has
selected 6 companies as comparables on the basis of the search conducted in
the public data base Prowess only. Further, TPO applied the following filters:

12\. The Assessing Officer accordingly passed an order under section
144C(13)/143(3) of the Act determining the adjustment at Rs.3,03,25,034/- and
as such, income of the appellant was finally  11 ITA No.1035/Del./2015
assessed at Rs.3,06,78,474/-. The said adjustment has been computed in the
manner hereunder:

13\. Before us the learned counsel for the appellant made oral arguments and
also filed written submissions. Both during the course of oral arguments and
in written submissions, no specific submission have been made viz-a-viz
grounds 1 to 5 of grounds of appeal. It has been contended that ION Trading is
engaged in rendering generic, repetitive software development services to its
AE-ION Trading UK Limited and is therefore characterized as a captive or low-
risk service provider, compensated on a fixed fee basis. It was further
submitted that the TPO/DRP/AO have erred in making an adjustment of Rs.
3,03,25,034/- to the value of the international transaction of provision of
computer software development services by the appellant to its AE. In support
of the  12 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 above submission, it has prayed for inclusion
of the comparable M/s CG-Vak Software and Exports Limited (segmental) and
exclusion of (i) M/s E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd., (ii) M/s Infinite Data System
(P) Ltd. (iii) M/s Infosys Ltd., (iv) M/s Persistent Systems Ltd., (v) M/s
Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. (vi) M/s Thirdware Solutions Limited
and (vii) M/s Wipro Technologies Services Limited. in the final set of
comparables. Apart from the above, it was also prayed that AO/TPO/DRP erred in
contravening provision of rule 10B(1)(e)(i) by considering the unutilized rent
and maintenance expenses as expenses incurred in relation to the international
transaction of the provision of software development services. It was also
submitted that the authorities below have grossly erred in not allowing the
risk adjustment under Rule 10B(1)(e)(iii) and Rule 10B(3) to account for
differences in the risk profile of the comparable companies vis-a-vis the
appellant. The learned DR has supported the orders of DRP/TPO/AO and contended
that adjustment made should be sustained and, no interference is warranted.

13 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

14\. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material placed
on record. The first and foremost substantive contention raised by the learned
counsel vis-a-vis Ground 6 of Grounds of Appeal is that DRP violated the
provisions of Rule 10B(2) of the Rules by rejecting CG-VAK Software Exports
Limited, a comparable company selected by the appellant in the TP
documentation by modifying the filter of employee cost being less than 25% of
turnover as proposed by the ld. TPO to employee cost of less than 75% of
turnover and further erred in incorrectly computing the filter ratio at less
than 75% instead of correct ratio of 79.69% of turnover. The TPO had rejected
the above comparable by holding as under:

> "Rejection of CG-VAK as a comparable by the undersigned is valid for the
> reasons explained in the show cause notice. Further, the assessee has not
> submitted any detail to justify that each one of the identified filters are
> satisfied in this case. Since the assessee company has failed to discharge
> its onus, the undersigned is constrained, to reject the said company as
> comparable."

15\. It is seen that the reasons mentioned in the show cause notice vis-à-vis
the said comparable was that the financials do not reflect the details of
related party transaction and the other important filters  14 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 which have been ignored by the assessee from the final list
of comparable companies.

16\. Before the DRP the appellant contended as under:

> "CG-VAK Software & Exports Ltd. was incorporated in 1995. The company
> specializes in consulting services and offshore software development. It is
> engaged in providing outsourced software product services (product
> lifecycle, product maintenance, product migration, product testing, tech

> 17\. However the DRP upheld the exclusion on the following basis:

> "Having considered the above and the material placed on record, we are of
> the opinion that the said company does not satisfy the filter applied by the
> TPO of employee cost less than 75% of turnover and therefore the same cannot

17 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

> \- Lam Research India (P) Ltd. vs. DCIT [TS 203-ITAT-2015 (Bang)]

> \- Yodlee Infotech (P) Ld. vs. ITO [TS-465-ITAT-2014 (Bang)]

> \- Cisco System India (P) Ltd. vs. DCIT [TS-246-ITAT-2014 (Bang)]

> 21\. We have considered the submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee
> and have considered the argument of the ld. DR that the assessee is not
> producing any product, however, we find that CG-

Vak Software and Exports Limited is not only into computer software but it is
a product manufacturer too. Since assessee is not into product manufacturing
and the segmental details cannot be bifurcated from the financial details, we
find that the assessee and the CG-Vak Software and Exports Limited are not
comparables. Therefore, we are inclined to uphold the orders of the
authorities below in rejecting this company as a comparable. We direct
accordingly.

22\. Now taking up Grounds No.7 to 13 of Grounds of Appeal, the learned
counsel made his submission for exclusion of comparables selected by TPO. We
will now consider the merits of the arguments of the parties with regard to
selection of the these companies as comparables by TPO.

18 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

23\. E-Infochips Bangalore Limited

24\. The learned AR contended that DRP/TPO have erred both in law and on facts
by considering E-Infochips Bangalore Limited as a comparable to the appellant.
The learned counsel for the assessee contended that the DRP, however has
ignored the submissions made by the assessee and upheld the action of the
Assessing Officer/TPO to include M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. in the list
of final comparables. The appellant has objected to the inclusion of the
comparable on the ground of functionally not comparable and, abnormal
deviation in profit margin. The appellant submitted that the functional
profile of M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. is different from that of the
assessee company. In this regard, he pointed out that the said company is a
product engineering services provider having a technical expertise in
software, firmware, hardware, FPGPA, ASIC, Quality testing etc. Its key focus
area in product engineering services includes conceptualization, Architecture
and Design, Sustenance and Support, Development, Production and Quality
testing. Further it focuses on wide array of industries including aerospace,
security and surveillance, semiconductor,  19 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 medical
devices, consumer devices, software and retail & E- commerce. It also has its
IPs and accelerators in software domain namely "Automated Quality Assurance
TestBorg (Aqua TestBorg) and the same was supported by the screenshot taken
from the company's website (https://www.einfochips.com/software-ips). He thus
contended that M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. thus is liable to be excluded,
besides due to functional differences, even on the basis of insufficient
information available in the public domain from the list of comparables.

25\. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the relevant
material on record. The contention raised by the learned counsel for the
assessee is that the entity M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. taken by the
Assessing Officer/TPO as comparable should be excluded from the list of final
comparables for the purposes of transfer pricing analysis on the ground of
functional differences as well as on the ground of insufficient information
available in respect of the said entity in public domain. In order to support
and substantiate his contention of functional dissimilarity, the learned
counsel for the assessee has heavily relied on the  20 ITA No.1035/Del./2015
contents of the website www.einfochip.com., the print out of relevant portion
of which is placed on record before us. On the basis of the said contents, he
has made an attempt to point out that M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. is
functionally different form the assessee company in as much as the said
company is mainly into development of new products whereas the assessee
company is mainly providing software development services. It is seen that
reference to the website of company is not of much help as it may not have
information which pertained to FY 2009-10. It is possible that these services
were provided by E-Infochips Ltd. instead of E- Infochips Bangalore Ltd. Also,
it is possible that provision of these services is a subsequent development.
Further, many of these services like software, FPGA, ASIC, QA & Testing
require software engineers only. Hence, the services and personnel required
are not entirely different. The reference made by the taxpayer is in respect
of website of E-Infochips Ltd. and not that of E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd.
After having gone through the website www.einfochip.com., we however find that
the same is in respect of the entire group of E-Infochips, of which M/s.
E-Infochips  21 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 Bangalore Ltd. is only a part. The
functional profile given on the said website thus is that of the entire group
and not just of the M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. The content of the said
website in our opinion, therefore, cannot be relied upon to ascertain the
functional profile of M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd., especially when the
nature of functions/services given there are materially different from the
functions/services stated to be rendered by M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. in
its annual report. Even the details of services stated to be rendered by M/s.
E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. at different places in its Annual Report are very
sketchy and it is very difficult to ascertain from the same, exact nature of
services rendered by the said entity.

26\. A perusal of the order of the DRP/TPO however, shows that no
finding/observation has been recorded by them on the ground of functional
differences as well as insufficient data/information available in the public
domain. It is also worthwhile to note here that the profit margin of M/s.
E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd. is abnormally high and although the said entity
cannot be excluded from the list of final comparables merely on the ground of
high or  22 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 abnormal profits, as held by in the case of
Maersk Global Centres (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT 147 ITD 83 and by
jurisdictional High Court in the case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors
(India) (P) Ltd. It should trigger further investigation in order to establish
whether it can be taken as comparable or not. As further held by the Special
Bench in the case of Maersk Global Centres (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra), such
investigations should be to ascertain as to whether earning of super profits
reflects normal business condition or whether it is the result of some
abnormal condition prevailing in the relevant year. The profit margin of such
entity in the immediately preceding year(s) may also be taken into
consideration and the FAR analysis in such cases may be reviewed to ensure
that the potential comparable earning higher profit satisfies the
comparability condition. Since this exercise has not been done either by the
AO/TPO or the DRP in the present case, we are of the view that the matter
should go back to the Assessing Officer/TPO for fresh consideration. This, in
our opinion, will also take care of the grievance of the assessee relating to
the lack of sufficient information in respect of M/s. E-Infochips Bangalore
Ltd. available  23 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 in the public domain in as much as
the TPO can obtain such information in the form of relevant schedules of the
Profit & Loss Account of the said entity as well as the segmental details, if
any, directly from the said entity.

27\. Following the above judgments, we therefore, set aside the impugned order
of the Assessing Officer as well as the direction given by the DRP on this
issue and restore the matter to the file of the Assessing Officer/TPO for
deciding the same afresh after giving the assessee proper and sufficient
opportunity of being heard.

28\. Infinite Data System Private Limited

29\. The learned counsel for the assessee further contended that the DRP, has
completely ignored the submissions made by the assessee and upheld the action
of the Assessing Officer/TPO to include Infinite Data System Private Limited
in the list of final comparables. The appellant objected to the inclusion of
the comparable before TPO on the following grounds:

    
    
         i)     Functionally not comparable
         ii)    Abnormal/Supernormal profits
         iii)   Significant intangibles
         iv)    Accepted as a non comparable in previous year by TPO
                                          24                 ITA No.1035/Del./2015
    
    
    
    

30\. The DRP upheld the order of TPO as under:

> "The TPO has dealt the issue in para 8,4, of the order and held that the
> company is providing software development services which is parimaterial
> with the functions carried on by the assessee. Having considered the
> material placed on record we find that the company is mainly involved in
> software services. Therefore we hold that TPO is right in including the same
> for the purpose of comparability analysis."

31\. Before us the learned AR of the appellant has contended as under:

> "Substantially Related Party Transactions

> \- Company's operations relates to providing services to its sole customer-
> Fujitsu Services Ltd." (substantially related) which can be substantiated as
> per the news letter and annual report.

> As per the News Letter Fujitsu entered into a BOT (Built, Operate &
> transfer) contract with Infinite Computer Solutions (India) Ltd. holding
> company of Infinite for development of offshore centre in India.

> The contract was signed in July 2008 for period of three years. Infinite

> operations are predominantly related to providing software technical
> consultancy services to us sole customer Fujitsu "services Ltd."

25 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

> (Refer page 689 of the Paper Book Volume II)

> b) Functionally not comparable As per Annual Report S(chedule 17) It
> provides solutions that encompass technical consulting, design and
> development of software, maintenance, system integration, implementation,
> testing and infrastructure management services.

> As per Annual Report (Revenue recognition section) It generates revenue
> primarily from Technical Support & Infrastructure Management services (Refer
> Page 685 of Paper Book Volume II)

> -Segmental information not available for software design and development.

> -Further, the financial state that more than 10% of the administration
> expenses & other expenses are towards project implementation expenses, which
> are different from software development (Refer Page 683 of the Paper book
> Volume II)

> c) Ld. TPOs approach of using data from Infinite's website as on the current
> date and drawing comparison thereof with FY 2009010 i.e. 4 years prior to
> the current year is incorrect.

> (Refer page 70 of the Paper book for TPO's observation)"

32\. On the other hand, the learned DR supported the order of the lower
authorities regarding the inclusion of the same in the list of comparables. He
reiterated the contents of the TPO's order which states as under:

26 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

> "It is seen that Infinite is providing following services:- technical
> consulting, design & development of software, maintenance, systems
> integration, implementation, testing and infrastructure management services.
> These services except infrastructure management services have also been
> refereed as 'technical support services' in Revenue Recognition portion and
> as 'software technical consultancy services' in Segment Reporting portion of
> the annual report. All these services are in the nature of software
> development services.

> .......It can be seen that all the services have been referred primarily as
> IT services. The objection of the assessee is mainly on verticals of the
> company. Under TNMM the standards of comparability are relatively relaxed
> and only broad similarity of functions is required. It is further stated
> that TNMM can be used with data for companies that are broadly comparable to
> the taxpayer, as functional differences are likely to be reflected in the
> level of operating expenses incurred by each company. These expenses are
> deducted in the calculation of operating profit and are accordingly taken
> account of in the comparability analysis. It is further seen that this
> company has been chosen as it is engaged in providing software development,
> which is broadly similar to the services being provided by the assessee.
> Since, the assessee is also providing similar services, so this company can
> be used as a comparable."

33\. We have heard the rival submissions and considered the facts and
materials on record. After considering the submissions, we are in agreement
with the conclusion of TPO/DRP held that Infinite is providing following
services: technical consulting, design & development of software maintenance,
systems integration, implementation, testing and infrastructure management
services. These services except infrastructure management services have  27
ITA No.1035/Del./2015 been referred as "technical support services in revenue
recognition portion and as 'software technical consultancy services' in
segment reporting portion of the annual report and thus services are in the
nature of software development services and having regard to the above it is
concluded that the Infinite is a functionally similar company to the appellant
company.

34\. We have gone through the annual report of the appellant company. The said
company provides solutions that encompass technical consulting, design and
development of software, maintenance, system integration, implementation,
testing and infrastructure management services which is functionally similar
to the appellant company. There is no RPT transaction of the comparable and
transaction with a sole customer does not constitute a RPT transaction.

35\. Having regard to the above and for the reasons stated above, we uphold
the conclusion of TPO for inclusion of Infinite Data System Private Limited
since it is comparable to appellant company.

28 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

36\. Infosys Limited

37\. The learned counsel for the assessee contended that the DRP has
completely ignored the submissions made by the assessee and upheld the action
of the Assessing Officer/TPO to include Infosys Limited in the list of final
comparables and submitted that Infosys Limited cannot be considered as a
comparable as it is engaged in diversified activities as it has wide spectrum
of services such as business services, technology services and outsourcing
services. It was contended that Infosys Limited is engaged in significant
Research & Development (R&D) that has led to creation of significant
Intellectual property. It has been further pointed out that as per Annual
Report of FY 2009-10, the company claims itself as the most reputed and
admired company in India (Pg. 18 of Director's Report). Further assessee
contended that Infosys Limited has a turnover of Rs 21,140 crores, which is
even more than 968 times of that of the assessee. The Ld. Counsel for the
appellant has placed reliance upon the various decisions, in which Infosys
Limited has been rejected as a comparable considering the same not  29 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 only as a giant company but is also engaged in development
of various niche products, which are as follows:

> i) 35 taxmann.com 421 (Hyd) Intoto Software India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Asst. CIT

> ii) 40 taxmann.com 173 (Hyd) NTT Data India Enterprise Application Services
> (P.) Ltd. vs. Asst. CIT

> iii) 38 taxmann.com 306 (Del) Agnity India Technologies (P.) Ltd.

> vs. DCIT

> iv) 38 taxmann.com 166 (Hyd) Virtusa (India) (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT

38\. The TPO has observed as under:

> "The brand name may have helped Infosys in increasing its number of clients
> & retention of existing clients and this an increase in its market share,
> but it has not necessarily resulted in better profit margins. Brand may
> bring more revenues but not necessarily higher margins....a brand may
> generate revenue but with a cost compensating any extra benefit, if any
> derived from such efforts."

> "Assessee had objected on the high turnover of this comparable company which
> is already discussed in the order. However, TPO has made an analysis in
> respect of influence of scale of operations on the profitability in the case
> of Infosys Technologies Ltd. From the year 1997 to 2012 based on the
> information extracted from the Capitaline Plus database, which shows that

> scale of operations have better margins is without any basis, and is
> therefore liable for rejection."

30 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

39\. The DRP supported the action of the TPO in including this company in the
final list of comparables by holding as under:

> "The TPO has dealt the issue in para 8.5 of the order and held that the
> company is providing software development services which is parimateria with
> the functions carried on by the assessee."

> Having considered the material placed on record we find that the company is
> mainly involved in software services" Therefore, we hold that TPO is right
> in including the same for the purpose of comparability analysis."

40\. We have considered the rival submission and perused the material placed
on record. The said comparable was recently considered by the decision of ITAT
in the case of Mentor Graphics (Noida) (P) Ltd. 60 taxmann.com 164 wherein
following the judgment of Jurisdictional High Court in the case of Agnity
India Technologies vs. ITO ITA No. 3856/2010 (Del), it was held as under:

> "15. We find that Ld. CIT(A) after considering the facts of the case and the
> submission of the AR observed that with regard to Infosys Technologies Ltd.
> it was evident from the Annual Report of the company that Infosys
> Technologies provides much wider range of services, performs extensive
> functions, undertakes diversified business activities and assumes
> significant risks as compared to routine software development service
> providers like the assessee. Further, the company undertakes substantial R&D
> activities and derives majority of its revenues the sale of proprietary
> products unlike the assessee. Also, the turnover of the company is
> significantly higher than that of the appellant and in no manner is
> comparable to the size/operations of the assessee.

31 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

16\. We note that all the above facts highlight that Infosys Technologies Ltd.
is a product owner, undertakes substantial advertising/sales promotion and
brand-building activities and is engaged in significant R&D activities, and is
very huge in size/volume as compared to the assessee. Hence, it cannot be said
to be comparable with the assessee. The said proposition has also been
confirmed by Delhi Tribunal in Agnity India Technologies v. ITO [IT Appeal
No.3856 (Delhi) of 2010] wherein the Coordinate Bench held as follows :

"Various arguments, as stated earlier, were taken before the DRP which inter-
alia included rejection of comparable cases; application of arbitrary filter
of wage to sales ratio; ignoring that the assessee is a limited risk company;
inclusion of Infosys Technologies Ltd.; and inclusion of Sat yam Computers
Services Ltd. in spite of the fact that its data is not reliable as publicly
known. On the basis of these arguments, the DRP excluded the case of Sat yam
Computers Services Ltd., thereby reducing the arm's length margin to 25.6%. It
is argued that the case of the assessee is not comparable with Infosys
Technologies Ltd., the reason being that the latter is giant in the area of
development of software and it assumes all risks, leading to higher profit. On
the other hand, the assessee is a captive unit of its parent company in the
USA and it assumes only limited currency risk. Having considered these points,
we are of the view that the case of aforesaid Infosys and the assessee are not
comparable at all as seen from the financial data etc. of the two companies
mentioned earlier in this order. Therefore, we are of the view that this case
is required to be excluded. Once that is done, it is the accepted position of
both the parties that the results of the assessee are in line with the mean
margin of comparable cases even if no adjustment is made on account of capital
etc. Therefore, it is held that no adjustment was required to be made to the
results declared by the assessee company."

11.5 The aforesaid order was upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court after
taking note of the chart as given below:  32 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 Basic

11.6 On the basis of the above chart, the Hon'ble High Court affirmed the
conclusion that a captive unit of acomparable company which assumed only a
limited risk cannot be compared with a giant company in the area of
development of software who assumes all types of risks leading to higher
profits. The facts of the appellant are akin and therefore, do not warrant any
different conclusion. The assessee is also captive service provider to its AE
and as such, M/s. Infosys Ltd. is not a valid comparable with the assessee

17\. Accordingly, Ld. CIT(A) proposed to exclude this company from comparable
set of companies. Therefore, the ld. CIT (A) has rightly ordered exclusion of
the Infosys Technologies Ltd. from the comparable and this impugned order is
upheld."

41\. Having regard to the above regard to the above judicial pronouncement, we
hold that Infosys Limited cannot be considered as comparable for the purpose
of benchmarking international transaction of the assessee.

42\. Persistent Systems Limited

43\. The assessee has sought exclusion of the aforesaid company on the ground
that this company is a technology company into software product development
services and is focused mainly on  34 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 three industries
i.e. Infrastructure & Systems, Telecom & Wireless, Life Science and
Healthcare, whereas the assessee is operating in finance domain which is
totally different. It was further submitted that on economy of scales, the
company Persistent Systems Limited is very large in comparison with that of
the assessee. It was also submitted that the company has revenue from sale of
products as well with the software services. It has been submitted that
segmental break of sales on sale of products and services has not been given
by the company as the pricing consequently the margin would differ that on
sale of products and sale of services. Per contra, the learned Departmental
Representative supported the action of the TPO in including this company in
the list of comparables.

44\. The TPO has held as under:

> "The company does have some products but as has been brought out above, the
> product revenue (from IP led businesses) are only 7.2%. Hence, the company
> is predominantly a software service provider and will be taken as a
> comparable. Under TNMM, the standards of comparability are relatively
> relaxed and only broad similarity of functions is required."

45\. The DRP supported the action of the TPO in including this company in the
final list of comparables by holding as under  35 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 "The
TPO has dealt the issue in para 8.6 of the order and held that the company is
providing software development services which is paramateria with the
functions carried on by the assessee. Having considered the material placed on
record we find that the company is mainly involved in software services.
Therefore, we hold that TPO is right in including the same for the purpose of
comparability analysis."

46\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered
the material on record. It is seen from the details on record that this
company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd., is engaged in product development and
product design services while the assessee is a software development services
provider. We find that, as submitted by the assessee, the segmental details
are not given separately. A Coordinate Bench in the case of Agnity India
Technologies (P) Ltd. vs. ITO 154 ITD 293 (Del) regarding the said comparable
has held as under:

> "11. So far as exclusion of three comparables i.e. Larsen and Tourbo
> Infotech Ltd., Persistent Systems Ltd. and Mindtree Ltd., it is noted that
> before the CIT(A) the assessee contended that during the financial year
> 2008-09, it has a turnover of approx. Rs. 14.45 crores which cannot be
> compared with certain companies having turnover of more than 200 crores.
> Support was drawn from the following decisions :

> (a) Decision of ITAT in the case of appellant for A.Y. 2006-07 ITA No.

(e) Actis Advisers (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [IT Appeal No. 5277 (Delhi) of 2011]

13\. Having considered the rival submissions and perused the material on
record. We find this issue is no longer res-integra. The Hon'ble High Court
upholding the decision of Tribunal in the case of the appellant for A.Y.
2006-07 has held in an order dated 10.7.2013 in ITA No. 1204/2011 in [CIT v.
Agnity India Technologies (P.) Ltd.[2013] 36 taxmann.com 289/219 Taxman 26
(Delhi)] that a giant company in the area of development of software which
assumed all risks leading to higher profits is not comparable with the
assessee which was a captive unit of the parent company and assumed only a
limited risk. The Hon'ble High Curt has held as under :

"8. It is a common case that Satyam Computer Services Ltd. should not be taken
into consideration. The Tribunal for valid and good reasons has pointed out
that Infosys Technologies Ltd. cannot be taken as a comparable in the present
case. This leaves L&T Infotech Ltd. which gives us the figure of 11.11%, which
is less than the figure of 17% margin as declared by the respondent- assessee.
This is the finding recorded by the Tribunal. The tribunal in the impugned
order has also observed that the age had furnished details of workables in
respect of 23 companies and the mean of the comparables worked out to 10%, as
against the margin of 17% shown by the assessee. Details of these companies
are mentioned in para 5 of the impugned order. 9. In view of the aforesaid
position, we do not think that any substantial question of law arises for
consideration. The appeal is dismissed."

16\. When considering the exclusion of persistent system Ltd, we find no need
to interfere in the order of the Ld CIT(A) because it  37 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 is engaged in development of software product; and this
company was excluded by the Tribunal in assessment year 2006-2007, which has
been up held by the Hon'ble High Court, thus the issue about exclusion of
persistent system Ltd, while making TP adjustments in it's case stands settled
in view of these decisions in its own case. Therefore we do not find any
necessity to interfere this company's exclusion.

17\. Having regard to the factual position and respectfully following the
judgment of the Hon'ble High Court we partly allow the ground raised by the
revenue and uphold the exclusion of persistent system Ltd, and direct
inclusion of Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd and Mind tree Ltd."

47\. Similar view has also been expressed in the case of Fiserv India (P) Ltd.
vs. DCIT 60 taxmann.com 345 (Del), it was held as under:

> "12.2 We have considered the rival submission and perused the material on
> record. The counsel for the assessee has contended that Persistent Systems
> Ltd. is functionally different from the assessee as the company is into
> software development services as well as software products unlike the
> assessee who is a captive service provider. Moreover, no segmental details
> are available in the annual report. It can be thus derived that the prices
> may have been influenced. The rationale of applying a related party filter
> is defended.

> 12.3 The Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in the case of CSR India (P.) Ltd .
> v. ITO [2013] 31 taxmann.com 265 , has held as under:

'(i) Turnover Filter 3.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the
materials on record. The TPO had, while selecting the above 26 comparables,
applied a lower turnover filter of Rs.1 crore but preferred not to apply any
upper turnover limit. The size of the comparable is an important factor in
comparability. The ICAI TP  38 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 guidance note has
observed that the transaction entered into by a Rs.1000 crores company cannot
be compared with the transaction entered into by a Rs.10 crores company and
the two most obvious reasons are the size of the two companies and related
economies of scale under which they operate. The TPO's range had resulted in
selection of companies as comparable such as Infosys which was 277 times
bigger than that of the assessee. The Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of M/s. Genisys Integrating Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT - ITA
No.1231/Bang/2010 relying on Dun and Bradstreet's analysis had held that
turnover range of Rs.1 crore to 200 crores is appropriate. The said
proposition has followed by the earlier Benches of this Tribunal in the
following cases: (i) M/s. Kodiak Networks (I) Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT - ITA
No.1413/Bang/2010; (ii) M/s Genesis Microchip (I) Pvt. Ltd. DCIT - ITA
NO.1254/Bang/2010; (iii) Electronic for Imaging India Pvt. Ltd - ITA
NO.1171/Bang/2010; & (iv) M/s. Trilogy E-Business Software India Private Ltd .
v. DCIT - ITA No.1054/Bang/2011 dated 23.11.2012. 3.3.1 In the case of
M/s.Genisys Integrating Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd . v. DCIT (supra ), relying
on Dun and Bradstreet', has observed as under:

"9. .............we find that the TPO himself has rejected the companies which
are making losses as comparables. This shows that there is a limit for the
lower end for identifying the comparables. In such a situation, we are unable
to understand as to why there should not be an upper limit also. What should
be upper limit is another factor to be considered. We agree with the
contention of the learned counsel for the assessee that the size matters in
business. A big company would be in a position to bargain the price and also
attract more customers. It would also have a broad base of skilled employees
who are able to give better output. A small company may not have these
benefits and therefore, the turnover also would come down reducing profit
margin. Thus, as held by the various benches of the Tribunal, when companies
which are loss making are excluded from comparables, then the super profit
making companies should also be excluded. For the purpose of classification of
companies on the basis of net sales or turnover, we find that a reasonable
classification has to be made. Dun & Bradstreet is more suitable and
reasonable. In view of the same, we hold that the turnover  39 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 filter is very important and the companies having a turnover
of Rs.1 crore to 200 crores have to be taken as a particular range and the
assessee being in that range having turnover of 8.15 crores, the companies
which also have turnover of 1.00 to 200 crores only should be taken into
consideration for the purpose of making TP Study."

3.3.2 The above view has been followed in the recent order of the Tribunal in
the case of Trilogy E -Business (supra ). The relevant findings of the
Tribunal are extracted as under:

20\. In this regard we find that the provisions of law pointed out by the ld.
counsel for the assessee as well as the decisions referred to by the ld.
counsel for the assessee clearly lay down the principle that the turnover
filter is an important criteria in choosing the comparables. The assessee's
turnover is Rs.47,46,66,638. It would therefore fall within the category of
companies in the range of turnover between 1 crore and 200 crores (as laid
down in the case of Genesis Integrating Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT, ITA
No.1231/Bang/2010) . Thus, companies having turnover of more than 200 crores
have to be eliminated from the list of comparables as laid down in several
decisions referred to by the ld. counsel for the assessee. Applying those
tests, the following companies will have to be excluded from the list of 26
comparables drawn by the TPO viz. Turnover Rs. (1) Flextronics Software
Systems Ltd. 848.66 crores (2) iGate Global Solutions Ltd. 747.27 crores (3)
Mindtree Ltd. 590.39 crores (4) Persistent Systems Ltd. 293.74 crores (5)
Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. 343.57 crores (6) Tata Elxsi Ltd.
262.58 crores (7) Wipro Ltd. 961.09 crores. (8) Infosys Technologies Ltd.
13149 crores".. In view of the above said reasoning and the orders of the
Benches of Bangalore Tribunal cited supra, the following 8 companies will have
to be eliminated from the list of comparables selected by the TPO, namely: •
Flextronics Software Systems Limited; • iGate Global Solutions Limited; •
Mindtree Limited; • Persistent Systems Limited; • Sasken Communication
Technologies Limited; • Tata Elxsi Limited; • Wipro Limited; & • Infosys
Technologies Limited. It is ordered accordingly.' 12.4 Following the aforesaid
decision of the Tribunal and the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in
the case of Aginity  40 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 Technologies (supra ) we hold
that Persistent Systems Ltd. should not be regarded as a comparable."

48\. Therefore, following the above judgments we hold that this company i.e.
Persistent Systems Ltd. ought to be omitted from the set of comparables for
the year under consideration. It is ordered accordingly.

49\. Sasken Communication Technologies Limited (Sasken)

50\. The assessee has sought exclusion of the aforesaid company on the ground
that this company has different business model and there is presence of
intangibles. It has also submitted that, as per Annual Report, the company
derives revenue from software products, which suggests that the company is a
product company unlike the assessee. It was further submitted that the company
has inventories amounting to Rs. 166.55 lakhs and being a software service
company, it was also provided that should not be holding any inventory in the
books of accounts. The assessee also contended that company is also actively
engaged in product development and earns revenue also from sale of software
products, there were also  41 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 peculiar economic
circumstances as it underwent restructuring during the year which inflated its
profit by Rs. 1,519.70 lakhs in addition to other factors affecting its sales
and margins. Further, the turnover of the company is more than 19 times of the
appellant. The TPO has held as under:

> "It is seen that this cost (contract staff cost) is insignificant in
> comparison to employee cost of Rs. 213.46 cr."

> "All software companies have software in their fixed assets. It is only when
> it is significant and developed by them and is being amortized on sale of
> software products exceeding 25% of total income, it can be said to be
> resulting in different income which changes the profile from pure software
> developer to a company also selling products. It is further seen that this
> company has been chosen as it is engaged in providing software development,
> which is broadly similar to the service being provided by the assessee.
> Since, the assessee is also providing similar services, so this company can
> be used as a comparable."

51\. The DRP supported the action of the TPO in including this company in the
final list of comparables by holding as under:

> "The TPO has dealt the issue in para 8.8 of the order and held that the
> company is providing software development services which is parimateria with
> the functions carried on by the assessee.

> Having considered the material placed on record we find that the company is
> mainly involved in software services. Therefore, we hold that TPO is right
> in including the same for the purpose of comparability analysis."

42 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

52\. We have considered the submission and perused the material placed on
record. A Coordinate Bench of Tribunal in the case of Tibco Software (India)
(P) Ltd. vs. DCIT ITA No. 94/PN?2014 dated 10.4.2015, it was held as under:

> "32. By way of Ground of Appeal No.4.5, the appellant has assailed the
> action of the TPO in excluding Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd. from
> the final set of comparables. As per the discussion in para 11(viii) of the
> order of the TPO, it is noticed that the said concern has been excluded on
> the ground that during the year under consideration it has undertaken
> business restructuring. The Ld. Representative also pointed out that in the
> show-cause notice dated 31.10.2012 issued by the TPO another reason has been
> advanced which is to the effect that the said concern fails the export
> turnover filter of 75% of the total turnover."

53\. Having regard to the above judgment and since it is evident from record
that Sasken Communication Technologies Limited is functionally not similar to
the appellant and also having gone through restricting in the instant year, it
cannot be treated as comparable to assessee. We order accordingly.

54\. Thirdware Solutions Limited (Thirdware)

55\. The assessee has objected to the inclusion of the said comparable on the
following ground that the aforesaid company is focused on solutions and
services in the Enterprise Allocation Space  43 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 (EAS) in
the Transaction, Analytics, and Collaborative Solution Layers. This includes
ERP, customer relationship management (CRM), SCM, BI/DW, BPM etc. Thirdware
offers Application Implementation Services (AIS), Application Development
Services (ADS) and Application Management-support Services (AMS). It was
further submitted that it is engaged in development of own software-PAPA and
has incurred expenses towards import of software service, evidencing
outsourcing of software services unlike the Applicant company. The TPO has not
provided any reason for holding Thirdware as a company comparable to the
Appellant whereas, The DRP while upholding Thirdware as comparable to the
Appellant company observed as under:

> "The audited report of the company reveals that company is mainly engaged in
> software development. The majority of income is from software development.

> Having considered the material placed on record we find that the company is
> mainly involved in software services. Therefore, we hold that TPO is right
> in including the same for the purpose of comparability analysis."

56\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered
the material on record. It is seen from the details on record that the
functions of Thirdware are in contrast with  44 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 the
assessee which only provides software development in the finance domain as per
the instruction of its AE. Also, Thirdware has incurred expenses towards
import of software services, evidencing outsourcing of software services
unlike the assessee. Since it is also engaged in outsourcing its activities as
it has incurred expenses towards imports of software services, evidencing
outsourcing of software services unlike the appellant company. Hence, it is
functionally not comparable and cannot be treated as a comparable to assessee.
We order accordingly.

57 Wipro Technology Services Limited (Wipro)

58\. As far as this company is concerned, the arguments of the assessee were
not only on account of functional dissimilarity but the assessee also raised
the other objection that there was an extraordinary event during the year.
Wipro provides program management and third party information security
assessment services to businesses that outsource technology and operations to
third party vendors in India, the Philippines, China and the Russian
Federation. It also offers software quality management, quality assurance, and
business process management services as well as  45 ITA No.1035/Del./2015
technology infrastructure support, development and deployment for strategic
software applications to information technology and business professionals.
During the year, Wipro Limited (Wipro) has reached an agreement with Citigroup
Inc. for acquiring all of Citigroup interest in CTS w.e.f. 21 January 2009. On
21 January 2009, Wipro signed a master service agreement (MSA) with Citigroup
Inc. for the delivery of technology infrastructure services and application
development and maintenance services for the period of six years. Without
prejudice, it was submitted that before 20.01.2009, the Company was part of
the Citi group and rendered services to various entities of the Citi group
worldwide. With effect from 21.01.2009, the Company was acquired by Wipro Ltd.
however, in order giving effect to the directions of Hon'ble DRP, Ld. TPO has
held that "In the case of M/s Wipro Technology Services Ltd., assessee is
submitting that the transaction of rendering services by Wipro Technology to
Citi Group are construed as deemed international transactions as per section
92B(2) of the Act. However, Annual Report of the company has been perused and
it is seen from the audited Financial that in RPT  46 ITA No.1035/Del./2015
schedule it is not considered as an Associated Enterprise. The TPO has not
provided any reason for holding Wipro as a company comparable to the Appellant
whereas The DRP while upholding Wipro as comparable to the Appellant company
observed as under:

> "The audited report of the company reveals that company is mainly engaged in
> software development. The majority of income is from software development.

> Having considered the material placed on record we find that the company is
> mainly involved in software services.

> However, the assessee has brought to the notice that Wipro Technologies
> Service Ltd has RPT of more than 25%. The AO is directed to verify the
> computation provided by the assessee and if RPT is more than 25% than it
> should not be included for the purpose of comparability analysis."

59\. We have considered the rival submissions, perused the material on record.
In our view, Companies that are affected by factors like persistent losses,
declining sales, extraordinary Income or expense, mergers and acquisitions or
other such factors which affect the operations of the company substantially
should not be used as comparables as they will not prove to be good
benchmarks. Further, while repelling the objection regarding extra-ordinary
event taking place for this comparable, but for a different reason, i.e. the
relevant extra ordinary event took place in the preceding Financial  47 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 Year i.e. FY 2008-09. However, we concur with the
submissions advanced by Ld AR that the Director's Report and Notes to Account
for this comparable are not available in public domain. Ld. DR has not been
able to controvert this fact. Since sufficient information for this comparable
is not available, we direct exclusion of this company as a comparable.

60\. Now taking up Ground No. 14, which relates to adjustment of unutilized
rent and maintenance expenses as expenses incurred in relation to the
international transaction of the provision of Software development services.
The assessee contended that as per the rule 10B(1)(e)(i) of Income Tax Rules,
1962 which details transactional net margin method provides "the net profit
margin realized by the enterprise from an international transaction entered
into with an associated enterprise is computed in relation to costs incurred
or sales effected or assets employed or to be employed by enterprise or having
regard to any other relevant base". In view of the above, for computing margin
from an international transaction adjustment claim ought to be allowed.

48 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

61\. The TPO has rejected the contention of the assessee by holding that:

> "The contention of the assessee company is not acceptable on account of the
> following reasons:-

> a) The assessee has admitted that the expansion was at the behest of the AE
> only. Since the assets for the anticipated increase in business had
> allegedly gone unutilized, the compensation thereof should have been borne
> by the AE and in no case should be charged on the assessee company.

> b) Expenditure on enhancement of business is a routine operating expenditure
> which is undertaken with the intention of gaining more business. The
> assessee has done just the same in its case by taking the step of hiring
> more space. This expenditure cannot be taken to be extra ordinary in nature
> for the simple reason that it was expended in the hope of gaining business
> as is done by millions of businesses worldwide and every failure cannot be
> written off by the tax authorities as being extra ordinary. In this case the
> assessee has over reached itself in the hurry to get business by committing
> a sum of money in terms of rental and maintenance charges.

> c) The assessee is required to support its claim for any adjustment with
> robust data and full details and evidences so as to enable the TPO to
> examine the claim. The burden is on the assessee whenever it makes a claim
> and in this case, it has not discharged the burden of proof. These
> adjustments are being claimed in an adhoc manner. Further, according to
> assessee since fixed cost remain constant irrespective level of operation
> and therefore such costs could not be optimally utilized to low level of
> capacity utilization. In view of this office capacity adjustment in service
> industry is not applicable as the business model I s cost plus so there is
> no question of idle capacity in terms of fixed costs assets.

> d) If the taxpayer had seen a sudden spike in the volume o f its work during
> the year, it would have reaped the benefits of advance planning and
> foresight. This would have resulted in  49 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 greater
> profits and better margins owing to its smart moves. However, when the
> volume of work did not grow as anticipated, it is seeking an adjustment due
> to the same smart business move. It cannot cut both ways.

> e) Moreover, the method of computing the adjustment is also not correct. Any
> comparability adjustment in transfer pricing analysis has to be carried out
> in respect of the comparable companies. In the instant case, the taxpayer
> has reduced its own employee costs to achieve the desired goal.

62\. We have considered the rival submissions, perused the material on record.
We uphold the order of Hon'ble DRP, as it has rightly held that as there is no
objective basis led by the assessee to support its claim; mere submission that
there was underutilization does not discharge the burden upon the assessee.
Moreover, the assessee has not given any cogent basis to satisfy the reasons
for under utilization. Once the assessee is a software service provider to its
AE then there can be no claim on account of under utilization of capacity as
it was AE who initiates such expansion. Hence, we reject the ground raised by
the assessee.

63\. The next issue raising in Ground No. 15 of Grounds of Appeal relates to
the risk adjustment under Rule 10B(1)(e)(iii) and Rule 10B(3) to account for
differences in the risk profile of the comparable companies vis-à-vis the
Appellant.  50 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

64\. The assessee contended that since it is a captive unit, it does not bear
any entrepreneurial risks. However, while proposing the set of comparables in
the notice, the Ld. TPO has not understood the risk-free nature of the
assessee and has failed to consider the full- risk taking profiles of the
companies selected as comparables.

65\. The AR has highlighted the significance of comparing the level of risks
between independent comparables and the taxpayer. It was submitted that TPO
should consider the risk free nature of the taxpayer's operations while
adjudicating on the transfer prices. Based on the above, ignoring the risk
profile of the Assessee would be unjust on the part of the revenue. He
contended that TPO/drip should have appreciated that the intent of the
transfer pricing legislation in India is to avoid tax evasion and not to cause
any hardship to the assessee.

66\. In view of and taking due cognizance of all the differentiating factors
cited above, the assessee contended that an adjustment with regard to the risk
premium earned by comparable uncontrolled companies is imperative for a fair
and judicious comparison of the  51 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 transfer prices of
the international transactions of the Assessee with the arm's length price.

67\. The TPO in its order dated 22.01.2014 has held as under:

> "The assessee hasn't claimed raised Risk Adjustment in its submission.
> However, it may claim at later stage on account of adjustment commensurate
> to the risk profile of the assessee. After carefully considering the facts
> of the case and the submissions of the taxpayer, I am not inclined to accept
> the assessee's future claim of risk adjustment. Risk adjustment as a general
> rule cannot be allowed unless it is clearly shown that the comparables had
> actually undertaken such risk and how the same materially affected their
> margins. The revised OECD guidelines of 2010 has also stated in Para 3.54 as
> under:-

> "Ensuring the needed level of transparency of comparability adjustments may
> depend upon the availability of an explanation of any adjustments performed,
> the reasons for the adjustments being considered appropriate, how they were
> calculated, how they changed the results for each comparable and how the
> adjustment improves comparability. Issues regarding documentation of
> comparability adjustments are discussed in Chapter V."

> From the above guidelines it can be seen that unless it is shown that how
> the risk adjustment would change the result of each comparable and how the
> same would improve the comparability and unless adequate reasons are given
> for such adjustment, no adjustment can be allowed to the taxpayer. In the
> present case, except giving proportion of various risks borne, the taxpayer
> has not shown with evidence as to whether each of the risk was actually
> undertaken or not by the comparables and if so, how these risks affected
> each of them and whether such adjustment would improve the comparability.
> Mechanical adjustment cannot be made to the margins of the comparables
> without knowing which risk was taken by the entity concerned and how its
> profitability was affected. Probability of risk and certainty of risk are
> two different aspects and cannot be equated for the purpose of adjustment.
> In my view assessee cannot be compared to a risk free security. Even other
> methodology, whether adhoc adjustment as in  52 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 case
> of Sony India, CAPM or Sharpe Ratio (which is a measure of the excess return

> by Hyderabad ITAT in the case of ADP Private Ltd, are based on return of
> capital which is not the PLI adopted by the assessee and the TPO. All this
> requires robust and reliable data, both for the assessee and the comparables
> in the absence of which risk adjustment cannot be considered for enhancing
> comparability."

68\. Further, DRP upheld the view of Ld. TPO by holding as under:

> "We have carefully considered the facts of the case and the submissions of
> the assessee. As per Rule 10B(2) and 10B(3) of Income Tax Rules, 1962,
> Indian Transfer pricing provisions prescribe only for "reasonable accurate
> adjustment" and further adjustment to the margins of comparables can be made
> only if they enhance comparability. But at the same time the data for the
> same must be relevant reliable and robust. Risk adjustment as a general rule
> cannot be allowed unless it is clearly shown that the comparables had
> actually undertaken such risk and how the same materially affected their
> margins. The revised OECD guidelines of 2010 has also stated in para 3.54 as
> under:-

> "Ensuring the needed level of transparency of comparability adjustments may
> depend upon the availability of an explanation of any adjustments performed
> the reasons for the adjustments being considered appropriate, how they were
> calculated how they changed the results for each comparable and how the
> adjustment improves comparability. Issues regarding documentation of
> comparability adjustments are discussed in Chapter V."

> Even the various judicial decisions on the issue of adjustments and even
> OECD guidelines, impresses upon time and again that the adjustment should be
> "reasonable accurate adjustment".

13.10 From the above guidelines, it can be seen that unless it is shown that
how the risk adjustment would change the result of each comparable and how the
same would improve the comparability and unless adequate reasons are given for
such  53 ITA No.1035/Del./2015 adjustments, no adjustment can be allowed to
the assessee. In the present case, except pointing out various risks, the
assessee has not shown with evidence as to whether each of the risk was
actually undertaken or not by the comparables and if so, how these risks
affected each of them and whether such adjustment would improve the
comparability.

13.11 Mechanical adjustment cannot be made to the margins of the comparables
without knowing which risks were taken by the entity concerned and how its
profitability was affected. Probability of risk and certainty of risk are two
different aspects and cannot be equated for the purpose of adjustments. The
significant of risk depends on its economic significance, likelihood of its
realization and predictability. All these requires robust and reliable data,
both for the assessee and the comparables in the absence of which tax
adjustments cannot be considered for enhancing comparability. Thus the
objection is rejected.

13.12 In the various judicial pronouncements the risk adjustment has not been
allowed by the ITATs. Some of these decisions are discussed below:

(a) Vedaris Technology 2010-TII-10-ITAT-Del-TPL: No risk adjustment to be
allowed even on ad hoc basis particularly when the same has not been
quantified;

(b) Marubeni India Private Ltd. (2010-TII-36-ITAT-Del-TP) in which it was held
that as the assessee failed to bring any evidence on record to show that there
was any difference in risk profiles of comparable companies and since the
assessee failed to file the details exhibiting risk borne by comparables, no
risk adjustment can be given, even on ad hoc basis.

(c) ADP Private Limited (2011-TII-44-ITAT-Hyd-TP) wherein the ITAT held that
there is no thumb rule for allowance of risk adjustment.

(d) Symantec Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (2011-TII-60-ITAT- Mum-TP): The ITAT
held that;

54 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

> (i) Until and unless it is shown that the difference in function and risk
> results in deflation or inflation of financial results of the comparables,
> it is not a general rule to grant it as a standard adjustment.

> (ii) The assessee could not show how such difference in risk and functions
> affected the results of the comparables.

> (e) ST Micro Electronics (2011-TII-63-ITAT-Del-TP): The assessees claim that
> it was a risk free captive service provider and hence cannot be compared
> with comparables who were full entrepreneurs was not accepted by the ITAT.

> (f) Exxon Mobil Company India Pvt. Ltd. (2011-TII-68-ITAT- Mum-TP): The ITAT
> held that since working capital adjustment has been given and the assessee
> has not worked out the risk adjustment, no adjustment can be granted on this
> account.

> 13.13 Therefore, for the reasons mentioned above, we decline to interfere
> with the action of TPO in this regard."

69\. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material placed
on record. In our view, where the assessee succeeds in ably demonstrating that
the comparables finally selected bore relatively more risk than it, then there
should be no denial of the risk adjustment. If, however, the assessee fails in
specifically pointing out the extra risks undertaken by the comparables, then,
of course, there cannot be any question of granting risk adjustment. Under the
transfer pricing regime, onus is always on the assessee to show the reasons
for claiming any separate adjustment by pointing out the  55 ITA
No.1035/Del./2015 differences between it and the comparables. Risk adjustment
can be allowed provided the assessee places on record some appropriate
material to demonstrate that the risk undertaken by the comparable companies
were relatively more than it, warranting downward adjustment in their profit
rates. Further, the variation in such risks, if any, should be capable of
quantification on some reasonable and logical basis. Since the ld. AR has
failed to objectively demonstrate the relatively higher risks undertaken by
the comparables on an overall basis, we are disinclined to grant any risk
adjustment. 69.1 In view of the foregoing discussion, we set aside the
impugned order and remit the matter of determination of ALP of the
international transaction of 'Provision of IT enabled data conversion
services' to the file of TPO/AO for a fresh decision in accordance with our
above observations/directions. Apart from the issues discussed in this order,
the decision of the TPO on all other aspects of the determination of the ALP
of this international transaction should be considered as final, as no other
issue has been agitated before us.

56 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

70\. Ground No. 16: On the facts and in law, the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO and the
Hon'ble DRP erred in not granting the benefit of reduction/variation of 5
percent from the arithmetic mean while determining the arm's length price to
the Appellant as per the proviso to section 92C(2) of the Act.

71\. This issue has been dealt at great length by the TPO/DRP. Both have
referred to the relevant provisions, circulars and judgments on the issue.
Accordingly, We do not find any infirmity in the order of the TPO/ DRP in this
respect and the same is therefore upheld.

72\. In Grounds No. 18 assessee has challenged the levy of interest u/s 234B.
Since the chargeability of interest u/s 234B will ultimately depend upon the
income to be determined in accordance with our directions contained
hereinabove, at this stage it is premature to dwell upon this issue. It is
open for assessee to raise the issue at the appropriate stage. Similarly,
Ground Nos. 19 and 20 are consequential in nature.

57 ITA No.1035/Del./2015

73\. Ground No. 21 not connected on merits since the issue emerges when the
proceedings under section 271(1)(c) are independently initiated. Therefore
this ground is rejected.

74\. In the result, the appeal is disposed off as above. Order pronounced in
open court on this 07th day of December, 2015.
