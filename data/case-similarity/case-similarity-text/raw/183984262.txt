     ORAL JUDGMENT:
    
    
    

1\. The action is in design infringement and passing off. There is also a
prayer in the suit for relief in passing off in relation to packaging. The
design in question is of a plastic water bottle. The Plaintiffs (collectively,
"Cello") claim to have designed a unique water bottle --in the words of the
Designs Act 2000, one that has both novelty and originality. This claim is
based on the bottle's shape, configuration and surface ornamentation. Cello
says the Defendants (collectively, "Modware") illicitly brought into the
market a product that is indistinguishable in every single respect, down even
to the colours of the water bottles. Though Cello makes no claim in the colour
or colour combinations, Mr Tulzapurkar for the Plaintiffs makes a reference to
the two-tone colour scheme of the water bottles only to show the extent of
copying. He also points out  Page 2 of 30 30th March 2017 ::: Uploaded on -
03/04/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2017 00:38:10 ::: Cello Household
Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC that even the packaging adopted by
Modware is so remarkably similar to Cello's that it cannot be a mere
coincidence.

2\. The facts lie in a narrow compass. Both Plaintiffs are partnership firms.
They are part of the Cello Group of companies. They make various types of
plastic insulated products such as bottles, bowls and so on. The 2nd Plaintiff
owns the house mark CELLO. It controls this for other group companies. The 1st
Plaintiff manufactures and markets these products bearing the house mark.

3\. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the plaint speak to the Plaintiffs' reputation and
corporate track record. There is no dispute about this. Cello claims a high
sales turnover and promotional expenses. I will accept this too as correct.
There is no denial and no part of the defence is based on this.

4\. The bottle in question is known as the PURO bottle. The Plaintiffs say it
has a unique innovative, original and novel design. The novelty claimed is set
out in paragraph 11 of the plaint and its sub-paragraphs:

> "11. The feature of novelty in PURO Bottle design resides inter alia in its
> overall shape, configuration and surface pattern making the said design
> aesthetically appealing and attractive. The characteristic features used by
> the Plaintiffs to impart distinctive design to the PURO bottle along with
> the cap manufactured by them are highlighted herein below:-

                               which gives elegant effect to the PURO
                               Bottle.
    
                      (8)      The main body of the PURO bottle as also
                               its cap contains a unique colour
                               combination of two colours.

> registration with the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade
> Marks, who granted the application under Design Registration No. 283345 on
> 23rd August 2016 with a priority date of 12th May 2016.1 Cello claims this
> bottle is unbreakable, leak-

proof and, being BPA-free, safe. In paragraph 18 of the Plaint, Cello says the
aesthetic (i.e., the non-functional or capricious) elements in the design,
including the surface ornamentation and the other unique features referred to
earlier, have never been used in such combination for any previous bottle. The
PURO bottle is sold in various two-tone colour combinations in a distinctive
packaging. It is one of Cello's most successful and popular products. A
separate statement of sales from May 2016 to December 2016 for the PURO
bottle, certified by the Chartered Accountants, is annexed,2 as are sample
invoices.3 Cello claims that in that very brief span of six months or so, it
achieve PURO bottles sales in excess of Rs. 7 crores. Cello also says it was
widely advertised.

6\. Cello claims that it came upon Modware's rival bottle, under the name
KUDOZ, in the third week of January 2017. The similarity is so exact, says Mr
Tulzapurkar, that both infringement and passing off are self-evident.

7\. In paragraph 21 of the plaint, Cello first sets out in a tabular fashion
its product and compare it to Modware's. There follows a 1 Plaint, Exhibit
"E", pp. 104-110.

SIDE The placement of word like BPA Free, Insulated Water bottle, Break Free,
Leak Proof etc. are copied from the Plaintiff's packaging.

9\. I have reproduced these images not for a juxtaposed comparison myself, but
because when the actual bottles and packaging were placed before me, my
question to Counsel on both sides was "Which is whose?" I should imagine that
in an action such as this, that is more than enough for the grant of interim
relief. After all, this branch of law requires the test to be that of the
Court's impression, presumably on the footing that if a judge cannot tell the
difference then more should not be demanded of the average consumer, he of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection.

10\. The tests for the reliefs in infringement and passing off often overlap.
Similarity in the two products is undoubtedly common ground. If one should
find, therefore, that Modware's product is confusingly and deceptively similar
to that of Cello's registered design, ordinarily an injunction on the cause of
action in infringement should follow. The defences are few and well-known.
These would include saying that the design is known to the prior art; there is
prior publication or, perhaps, that the plaintiffs' only claim, correctly
read, is neither of novelty nor originality but of merely cobbling together
several pre-existing known designs, or mosaicing. Indeed, these are the
principal defences that Mr Tolia for Modware takes.

11\. Slightly different considerations arise when assessing the claim in
passing off. Here, as in any passing off action, a plaintiff must satisfy all
three probanda of the so-called Classical Trinity: (i) reputation and goodwill
in the goods; (ii) misrepresentation by the Defendants; and (iii) damage. This
posits that similarity is demonstrated to begin with; that done, the question
then is not so much whether it is confusing, but whether it is calculated to
deceive. Passing off is an action in deceit; the deceit lies in the
misrepresentation; and the misrepresentation must be as to source, i.e., to
deceive the average consumer into believing the defendant's product is the
plaintiff's. There need not be fraud, and intention is irrelevant. It is well-
settled that actual damage does not have to be proved. The mere likelihood of
damage, viz., that damage was reasonably foreseeable, suffices. Reputation and
goodwill are also slightly different concepts. This has been the subject of
some debate in international cases but this need not detain us today because
Cello  Page 10 of 30 30th March 2017 ::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 04/04/2017 00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware
India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC claims both reputation and goodwill and does not seek
to treat the two as synonymous. There is some authority for the proposition
that there must be a sale, because without a sale there is no
misrepresentation; and, too, for the proposition, that there must be some
prima facie evidence of misrepresentation, this not being a presumption. That
material can come in different forms, and one of this might be to show the
extent of copying and its exactitude, or to show that elements other than
those in which protection is claimed have also been copied.

12\. The passing off alleged is not only of the bottle itself but also of the
packaging. At this stage, I will note a few sections of the Designs Act 2000\.

2(d) "design" means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern,
ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether in
two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms, by any industrial
process or means, whether manual, mechanical or chemical, separate or
combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the
eye; but does not include any mode or principle of construction or anything
which is in substance a mere mechanical device, and does not include any trade
mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) or property mark as defined in
section 479 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or any artistic work as
defined in clause (c) of section 2 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957);

4\. Prohibition of registration of certain designs.-- A design which --

19\. Cancellation of registration. -- (1) Any person interested may present a
petition for the cancellation of the registration of a design at any time
after the registration of the design, to the Controller on any of the
following grounds, namely:--

(a) that the design has been previously registered in India; or

(b) that it has been published in India or in any other country prior to the
date of registration; or

(c) that the design is not a new or original design; or

(d) that the design is not registrable under this Act; or

(e) that it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.

(2) An appeal shall lie from any order of the Controller under this section to
the High Court, and the Controller may at any time refer any such petition to
the High Court, and the High Court shall decide any petition so referred."

13\. Modware has made no application for cancellation of Cello's registered
design.

14\. Annexed to the plaint also, apart from the body of the plaint, are
further comparisons. Cello's PURO bottle is shown in different colours at
pages 100, 101, 102 and 103 and is contrasted with Modware's KUDOZ bottles in
corresponding colours at pages 144, 145, 146 and 147.

15\. Mr Tolia's defences are these. He says, first, that there is prior
publication. He says this on the basis that Modware also manufactures bottles.
His case is that a bottle is a bottle, by whatever name called. It is a
container of liquid. Generally, it is taller than wider. Modware makes very
many bottles. So do others. He shows me images of Modware's various bottles
and those of other manufacturers. All these are just bottles, he says.
Therefore, according to him, there is neither novelty nor originality in
Cello's claim as to 'shape' or 'configuration'. Others have also made tall
cylinders with screw top or flip top lids. Cello can claim no originality in
these.

16\. In paragraph 9 of the Affidavit in Reply, Modware claims that the shape
of the PURO bottle is "the natural shape of any bottle" and this is millennia
old. In paragraph 11 it then claims that the surface pattern or ornamentation
has no novelty. This is 'merely' an ovoid shape embossed or recessed on the
bottle's surface. Modware also suggests that the oval shape is functional to
provide a better grip. Cello makes no such claim. There is no evidence of this
at all.

00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC

17\. As to the bottle in question itself, Mr Tolia says all that Modware did
was to take the lid from one of its other products, Kool Kruiser, and apply it
to the KUDOZ product. The Kool Kruiser bottle has been in the market in the
past. Therefore the 'design' is known to the prior art. There is prior
publication. In April 2014, Modware launched its Kool Kruiser bottle. In May
2009, it applied for registration of its Kool King bottle, another similar
design, according to Mr Tolia. Mr Tolia insists Modware's KUDOZ bottle is
similar to its own earlier products, Kool Kruiser, Kool King and Mario in
various regards -- some in respect of shape, some in respect of configuration
and some in respect of design. But all these, even from the images that are
shown in the Reply, are entirely different from Modware's impugned product,
KUDOZ.

18\. The difficulty in accepting any of this is graphically demonstrated at
page 132 of the Notice of Motion paper book where Modware's KUDOZ bottle is
set next to its own Kool Kruiser bottle. The two are entirely different
products. The Kool Kruiser is nothing at all like Cello's PURO; but Modware's
KUDOZ bottle is almost exactly Cello's PURO bottle. That is the totality of
the case before me.

19\. The a-bottle-is-a-bottle argument must be rejected. It is not possible to
accept this submission that no vertical cylindrical fluid container can have
either originality or novelty because it is, after all, vertical and
cylindrical. That is an unacceptable over- simplification of the requirements
of the Designs Act and of the law on the subject.

00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC

20\. I find no explanation for Modware taking not only this registered design
but its identical -- or, at any rate, an extremely and certainly deceptively
similar -- packaging and the same two-tone colour combinations. These are all
issues that will have to be considered in the context of the settled law on
the subject. There is no manner of doubt in my mind that on all three aspects,
i.e., shape, configuration and ornamentation, the Modware KUDOZ product is
wholly indistinguishable from Cello's PURO bottle.

21\. The first test to which Mr Tulzapurkar invites my attention is that set
out in SJ Kathawalla J's order in Whirlpool of India Ltd v Videocon Industries
Ltd.4 The decision covered a range of issues in the context of rival designs
for washing machines. Paragraph 25 of the decision sets out the tests to be
applied in deciding what constitute an obvious imitation and is actionable as
such:

> "26. The question of what tests are to be applied in deciding what
> constitutes an obvious imitation and/or is actionable is no longer res
> integra. This question has been considered in several judicial
> pronouncements. The leading decisions on the point are the decisions in the

> (16) 202) and Kemp & Co. vs. Prima Plastics Limited (Vol. 101 (1) BLR 65).
> In both the decisions, the Kolkata High Court and the Bombay High Court have
> laid down the following propositions as constituting the test to decide
> whether there is obvious imitation and/or piracy of a registered design.

Castrol India Limited vs. Tide Water Oil Co.(I) Limited:(supra)

(i) The word 'imitation' does not mean 'duplication' in the sense that the
copy complained of need not be an exact replica.

(ii) The Court is required to see in particular as to whether the essential
part or the basis of the Plaintiff's claim for novelty forms part of the
infringing copy.

(iii) The similarity or difference is to be judged through the eye alone and
where the article in respect of which the design is applied is itself the
object of purchase, through the eye of the purchaser.

(iv) The Court must address its mind as to whether the design adopted by the
Defendant was substantially different from the design which was registered.
The Court ought to consider the rival designs as a whole to see whether the
impugned design is substantially different from the design sought to be
enforced. (The test laid down on Benchchairs Ltd. C. Chair Center Ltd. (1974
RPC 429) was cited with approval).

(v) 'Obvious' means something which, as soon as one looks at it, strikes one
as being so like the original design/the registered design, as to be almost
unmistakable. Fraudulent imitation is an imitation which is based upon, and
deliberately based upon, the registered design and is an imitation which may
be less apparent than obvious imitation, that is to say, one may have a more
subtle distinction between the registered design and a fraudulent imitation
and yet the fraudulent imitation, although it is different in some respects
from the original, and in respects which render  Page 16 of 30 30th March 2017

Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC it not obviously an
imitation may yet be an imitation perceptible when the two designs are closely
scanned and accordingly amounts to infringement. (The test laid down in Dunlop
Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Golf Ball Developments Ltd. ((1932) XLVIII RPC 279) was
cited with approval.

Kemp & Co. vs. Prima Plastics Limited: (supra)

(i) If the visual features of shape, configuration pattern designs are similar
or strikingly similar to the eye, it is not necessary that the two designs
must be exactly identical and same. The matter must be looked at as one of
substance and essential features of the designs ought to be considered.

(ii) In a given case, where the registered design is made up of a pattern
which has no one striking feature in it, but it appeals to the eye as a whole,
it may very well be that another design may be an imitation of it which makes
the same appeal to the eye notwithstanding that there are many differences in
the details. (The opinion of Farwell J. in Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. vs. Golf

(iii) In comparing rival designs the Court is required to see whether the
impugned design/product is substantially different to the design which is
sought to be enforced.

The aforesaid tests have been independently applied and/or followed in a

22\. The approach is not, as the Court said, in identifying individual
similarities or dissimilarities. These are not dispositive. The judicial
assessment must be on an examination of the rival products, actually made
available if possible. The products and designs must be seen as a whole, from
the perspective of the common consumer. The test is of visual appeal, and the
task is to see if the essentials of that which makes it visually appealing
have been substantially, but not necessarily exactly, copied.

23\. In this case too, one of the defences taken is that Modware took the lid
from one its own other designs and applied it to the one Cello says is the
infringing product. Mr Tulzapurkar's submission is that once an explanation
offered by Modware is found to be unworthy of credence, the inevitable
conclusion must be that Modware copied Cello's design. This is a submission
hard to resist.

24\. In Whirlpool, the defendants too alleged lack of novelty. This is how
Kathawalla J dealt with that submission:

25\. This entirely covers the defences taken before me, too, including Mr
Tolia's submission that Cello's product is a mere combination of known
designs.

26\. As to the question of passing off Kathawalla J held that there was no
dispute before him -- and indeed there is none before me -- that under Section
2(z) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the definition of "mark" includes the shape
of goods.

27\. Mr Tulzapurkar also draws my attention to the order of the Division Bench
in appeal from an earlier order in the same dispute, and in particular
paragraphs 13 and 14. There, Mr Tulzapurkar for the Appellant took the very
arguments that Mr Tolia takes today. Mr Tulzapurkar did not succeed. Neither
can Mr Tolia, and for exactly the same reasons. Both decisions bind me, and
particularly the finding that novelty and originality are to be tested in the
context of aesthetic or visual appeal.

28\. I must reject too Mr Tolia's argument of mosaicing. I believe it to be
misapplied to this case. It is not a requirement of the law in infringement or
passing off in relation to a design that every single aspect must be entirely
newly concocted and unknown to the history of mankind. If that were so, we
should never see any new or original design at all. It is a general rule that
"mosaicing" of prior art, i.e., combining selected features in different prior
art publications, is not permissible when assessing whether an invention is
new. Conversely, mosaicing is also no defence to a charge of infringement of a
registered design. Mosaicing contemplates taking known  Page 20 of 30 30th

integers or combinations and simply re-arranging them. In a situation like
ours, it might for example apply if Cello laid claim to a very similar bottle
with a similar shape, configuration and ornamentation but merely repositioned
the ornamentation by setting it horizontally rather than vertically and doing
not much else besides. That is not the case here.

29\. Mr Tulzapurkar also refers me to my previous decisions in Selvel
Industries & Ors v Om Plast (India)5 and Faber-Castell Aktiengesellschaft &
Ors v Cello Pens Pvt Ltd & Ors6 but I will pass over these quickly, noting
only that in this case, as in Selvel, I find no plausible explanation from
Modware as to how it chanced upon this very design. In paragraph 27 of my
decision in Faber-Castell I quoted a passage from Johns v Hallworth:7 "... I
only refer to it as showing what the difficulty is; because there, the Court
of Appeal, consisting of three learned Judges, all thought -- their three
pairs of eyes all thought -- that the similarities were supreme, as the
differences were of little moment. The difficulty of the task imposed upon the
Judge consists in what I have stated. One has to go through a certain process
of induction; because in no case that ever I tried and in no case that I ever
heard of was it not possible for the Defendant to say, "I am perfectly at
liberty to make this article; I am at perfect liberty to call it so-and-so; I
am perfectly at liberty to attach to it such-and-such a name," and so on to
the end of the chapter. If you take

similarity in detail, it is often not very difficult -- sometimes it is
extremely easy -- to show that in all those points of similarity the Defendant
is perfectly right and has played the part of an innocent man. That applies
directly to this case. No one contends that the Defendants are not entitled to
manufacture and sell polishing cloths; nobody contends that they are not
entitled to manufacture and sell polishing cloths of certain sizes, or to
impress thereon by printing or otherwise certain words; nobody contends that
they are not at liberty to make these of Egyptian or American cotton, and, if
they make them of Egyptian cotton alone, or of Egyptian and American cotton
mixed, not to produce them of a certain colour. Nobody contends that this fact
pile velveteen is not open and common to the trade and suitable to the
particular article; that it may not be singed; that it may not be scoured. All
those things are perfectly common to the trade; every one of them may be done
with perfect innocence. But, by an inductive process, one may come to this
conclusion, that every one of those perfectly innocent things when combined in
a series may produce something which is the reverse of innocent."

(Emphasis added)

30\. This is exactly true of the present case. Mr Tolia's attempt to dismember
the design into individual integers is futile. The configuration, shape and
ornamentation used in both is such that is impossible to tell one from the
other.

31\. Gorbatschow Vodka KG V John Distilleries Ltd8 is a decision that relates
to both Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act. On the question of passing off
and honesty in adoption, Chandrachud J (as he then was) said in paragraph 25,
citing the well-known case of Slazenger & Sons v Feltham & Co.9 "... There is
sufficient nearness, sufficient neighbourhood, in the one word to the other,
to justify me in coming to the conclusion that it is calculated to deceive. I
shall, no doubt, be assumed to conclude and I make no secret that I do
conclude that that finding is at least consistent with the honesty of the
case."

As Lord Justice Lindley held in that case:

> are driven to the conclusion that what is intended to be done is to deceive
> if possible, I do not think it is stretching the imagination very much to

32\. I am not impressed by Mr Tolia's argument based on Section 4(1)(c) of the
Designs Act 2000 that the Plaintiffs' bottle is not significantly
distinguishable from known designs or a combination of known designs. This is
not demonstrated in the least. His argument is that since a bottle is a
bottle, and is always only a bottle, only an expert that can tell one bottle
from the other. I do not think this is remotely true. For some who claim
familiarity with bottles -- perhaps for reasons unrelated to their design --
the differences are evident; many cylindrical liquid containers are instantly
recognized as unique and as indicative of their contents. The expertise,
usually borne of much experience, in such cases has not so much to do with the
design of a bottle as its contents. No "expert" can add much more than that
which is obvious to the naked eye.

33\. Mr Tolia then says that the Plaintiffs' design was 'anticipated'. How, he
does not say, nor by whom. Certainly it does not seem to have been
"anticipated" by Modware, for it waited till the PURO bottle reached the
market before embarking on production of its own competing product. Copying is
not anticipation. However, it may very well be both infringement and passing
off.

34\. Mr Tolia places a very great deal of reliance on the decision of the
House of Lords in Phillips v Harbro Rubber Company.10 This was 10 Vol. XXXVII
RPC 233.

00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC also
a case of design infringement. It pertained to a surface pattern of India
rubber pads or plates for heels or boots and shoes. Mr Tolia emphasizes this
to suggest that it is not the eye of the layman that should be determinative
but it should be that of an instructed person, one who would know what was
common trade knowledge and usage in the class. I understood this submission,
based on pages 239 and 240 of the report, to mean that it would require an
expert or a person well versed in the trade to be able to say what was and
what was not previously known to that trade; more particularly to prevent
normal trade variants from being masqueraded as new or original. Where, for
example, Mr Tolia says, it is not a question of a combination but merely an
optional addition to the article then the tests of design registration are not
met and no injunction should be granted. In the context of the items before
me, he submits that there is nothing to show that the oval ornamentation --
the "optional" element in our case -- is unique. I would actually invert this.
There is nothing before me to show that it was ever commonplace; certainly
Modware has not brought forth any such material. I do not see how we can rely
or demand the views of an expert to show us something that simply does not
exist or is not shown to be exist. It would be for Modware to show that such
ornamentation is commonplace. What the argument overlooks, I believe, is that
the House of Lords was duly instructed on the commonplace elements of trade
use. We find this at page 241 of the report, placetum 5. I have no such
'instruction' and Mr Tolia is unable to offer any for reasons that I think
that are obvious.

35\. But what really fails Mr Tolia's cause is the observation at page 243 of
this very report at placetum 10 that the design must be  Page 25 of 30 30th
March 2017 ::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2017
00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC taken
as a whole. In that case, the House of Lords may have found neither novelty
nor originality but I do not think it is at all legitimate for Mr Tolia to
expand this to suggest that the various integers in the bottle be segregated
and each integer separately tested for novelty and originality. That is not
even Cello's case. For a given bottle for, say, the manufacture of perfumes,
fragrances or specialized liquor products, it is entirely conceivable that the
bottle would take a completely unique shape, a never-seen-before combination
of shape, configuration and ornamentation.

36\. Mr Tolia is incorrect in saying that an expert view is the only test of
novelty and originality. I believe Mr Tulzapurkar is justified in his reliance
on the decision of the Court of Appeals in Wright, Layman & Umney LD v
Wright.11 This was in the context of passing off and the question was whether
there was anything to clearly distinguish the defendants' product from the
plaintiffs. That should be the determinant. In the present case, I am not
shown anything to support any such distinction.

37\. As to the question of reputation and goodwill, let us look at the
distinct factors that the Plaintiffs have pleaded in support of their case.
There is, first of all, largely uncontroverted, the material regarding
evidence of sales. Paragraph 19 of the plaint says (and I will leave aside all
sales figures) that in a six or seven month period, Cello achieved sales for
this particular bottle in excess of Rs 7 crores. The answer to this is not
what Modware suggests: that there are other bottles that are available in two
tones, that there are bottle 11 LXVI RPC 149.

Page 26 of 30

30th March 2017 ::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2017
00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC tops
or lids others arguably of a similar shape although none are shown to have the
combination Cello's bottle does. There is not, I find, a specific traverse of
paragraph 19 of the plaint and perhaps that might be expecting too much. So
when it comes to reputation the first factor we have is this large volume of
sales. Then there is a statement by the Plaintiffs of the wide advertising
done of the bottle. But the law on passing off requires that a reputation be
established as to source, i.e., as to the Plaintiffs. This might be little
more difficult where the manufacturer is a new entrant in the market. Cello is
not. The reputation of the Cello house mark is already such that the
Plaintiffs are an established name in direct relation to that mark. The
question is not of identification of the brand, i.e., PURO and the Plaintiffs
do not suggest that people necessarily buy a bottle by this name. What they do
suggest is that people tend to prefer bottles with the CELLO mark, i.e., as
identified as coming from the Plaintiffs' house or source; within that range
of choice of Cello's products, this particular bottle has achieved a great
deal of commercial renown. The question of establishing reputation for the
purposes of passing off by identifying the product and its origin or source is
thus answered.

38\. This takes us to the second requirement of showing misrepresentation, and
there, I imagine this must be a case of res ipsa loquitur. I can think of no
tenable explanation for Modware to have adopted a shape, configuration and
ornamentation so very nearly identical to that of Cello. Showing other bottles
of the same height or girth does not take Modware the required distance. There
is no explanation for the indistinguishable colours either, i.e., the exact
same two-tone colour combination used by Cello. Modware did not  Page 27 of 30
30th March 2017 ::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2017
00:38:10 ::: Cello Household Products v Modware India 925-NMSL209-17.DOC take
merely a two-tone scheme but with different colours. Modware took exactly
Cello's colours and colour combinations. This is true too of the packaging
that Modware chose, and here again between the blue colour, the droplets of
water and so on, the one is indistinguishable from the other.

39\. What does this tell us? Everything points but in one direction that
Modware was attempting to deceive consumers into believing that its products
came from the house of Cello. This is, therefore, prima facie, an attempt
calculated to deceive and the deception and misrepresentation is as to source
or origin. These are the necessary requirements that must be met in a cause of
action in passing off.

40\. Modware also contends that this Court does not have territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the Suit. I do not actually see how this can be
raised because paragraphs 25 and 26 of the Reply do contain a statement that
the label or printed matter on Modware's own product shows the address of one
Lalitkumar Shah, a relative of the 2nd Defendant. That address is in Mumbai.
In paragraph 27 the Defendants claim this address was only ever 'used for
correspondence' and Shah has no connection with the Defendants. That is a
submission that needs only to be stated to be rejected. Indeed I find it
inconceivable that anyone would put a 'correspondence only' address on a
physical object being offered for sale. This is usually found on letterheads
and stationary but not on tangible product put to market. What is not denied,
though, is that there is such a label; it is on Modware's product; and the
address on that label is in Mumbai. The defence here is futile.

41\. In my view, there is more than sufficient cause made out for the grant of
interim reliefs. An ample prima facie case is made out and the balance of
convenience is clearly in favour of the Plaintiffs, to whom irreparable injury
would be caused in my view if the injunctions sought are denied.

42\. On 2nd February 2017 I granted an ad-interim order in terms of prayer
clause (a), (b) and (c). I will confirm that as the final order on this Notice
of Motion.

43\. The Suit, in my view, will need to be registered in the Commercial
Division. The Registry will take the necessary steps in that regard acting on
an authenticated copy of this order.

44\. In view of the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 brought by
the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division & Commercial Appellate Division of
High Courts Act 2015, and in particular the amendments to Section 35 and 35A
of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, this would mean that costs would follow
the event, and an award of costs would have to be made against the Defendants.
The amended Act requires me to give reasons for not awarding costs and,
therefore, this: in view of the fair approach of Mr Tolia and Mr Soman
throughout, and noting they have argued their case with admirable economy of
time, I believe this is not a fit case for the award of costs.
