4\. The petitioner states that he is a financier who gives advances to various
contractors working with Director General, Defence Estates.

5\. Keeping in view the width and amplitude of the information sought by the
petitioner, it is apparent that the prayers in the writ petition are nothing
short of an abuse of process of law and motivated if not an attempt to
intimidate the respondent. In fact, even two days ago, this Court had dealt
with a writ petition filed by the present petitioner being W.P.(C) 784/2014
wherein equally wide information had been asked for under the RTI Act.

6\. In the opinion of this Court, the primary duty of the officials of
Ministry of Defence is to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India. If
the limited manpower and resources of the Directorate General, Defence Estates
as well as the Cantonment Board are devoted to address such meaningless
queries, this Court is of the opinion that the entire office of the
Directorate General, Defence Estates Cantonment Board would come to stand
still. The Supreme Court in CBSE vs. AdityaBandopadhyay, (2011) 8 SCC 497, has
held as under:-

> 62\. When trying to ensure that the right to information does not conflict
> with several other public interests (which includes efficient operations of
> the Governments, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information,
> optimum use of limited W.P.(C) 845/2014 Page 7 of 11 fiscal resources,
> etc.), it is difficult to visualise and enumerate all types of information
> which require to be exempted from disclosure in public interest. The
> legislature has however made an attempt to do so. The enumeration of
> exemptions is more exhaustive than the enumeration of exemptions attempted
> in the earlier Act, that is, Section 8 of the Freedom to Information Act,
> 2002\. The courts and Information Commissions enforcing the provisions of
> the RTI Act have to adopt a purposive construction, involving a reasonable
> and balanced approach which harmonises the two objects of the Act, while
> interpreting Section 8 and the other provisions of the Act.

> 63\. At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about
> the RTI Act. The RTI Act provides access to all information that is
> available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of Section 3
> and the definitions of "information" and "right to information" under
> clauses (f) and

> (j) of Section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in
> the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant
> may access such information, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the
> Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a
> public authority, and where such information is not required to be
> maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public
> authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to
> collect or collate such non-available information and then furnish it to an
> applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information
> which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also
> not required to provide "advice" or "opinion" to an applicant, nor required
> to obtain and furnish any "opinion" or "advice" to an applicant. The
> reference to "opinion" or "advice" in the definition of "information" in
> Section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the
> records of the public authority. Many public authorities have, as a public
> relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But
> that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation
> under the RTI Act.

W.P.(C) 845/2014 Page 8 of 11

> xxx xxx xxx

> 65\. The power under Section 19(8) of the Act, however, does not extend to
> requiring a public authority to take any steps which are not required or
> contemplated to secure compliance with the provisions of the Act or to issue
> directions beyond the provisions of the Act. The power under Section 19(8)
> of the Act is intended to be used by the Commissions to ensure compliance
> with the Act, in particular ensure that every public authority maintains its
> records duly catalogued and indexed in the manner and in the form which
> facilitates the right to information and ensure that the records are
> computerised, as required under clause (a) of Section 4(1) of the Act; and
> to ensure that the information enumerated in clauses (b) and (c) of Section
> 4(1) of the Act are published and disseminated, and are periodically updated
> as provided in sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 4 of the Act. If the
> "information" enumerated in clause

> (b) of Section 4(1) of the Act are effectively disseminated (by publications
> in print and on websites and other effective means), apart from providing
> transparency and accountability, citizens will be able to access relevant
> information and avoid unnecessary applications for information under the
> Act.

> 66\. The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to
> information are intended to be formidable tools in the hands of responsible
> citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and
> accountability. The provisions of the RTI Act should be enforced strictly
> and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information
> under clause

> (b) of Section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and
> accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging
> corruption. But in regard to other information [that is, information other
> than those enumerated in Sections 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act], equal
> importance and emphasis are given to other public interests (like
> confidentiality of sensitive information, fidelity and W.P.(C) 845/2014 Page
> 9 of 11 fiduciary relationships, efficient operation of Governments, etc.).

> 67\. Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act
> for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and
> accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of
> corruption) would be counterproductive as it will adversely affect the
> efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged
> down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information.
> The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to
> obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace,
> tranquillity and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into
> a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do
> their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of
> public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing
> information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The
> threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities
> under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities
> prioritising "information furnishing", at the cost of their normal and
> regular duties."

> (emphasis supplied)

> 8\. After all disproportionate diversion of limited resources to Directorate
> General, Defence Estates‟ office would also take its toll on the Ministry of
> Defence. The Supreme Court in ICAI vs. Shaunak H. Satya, (2011) 8 SCC 781
> has held as under:-

> "39. We however agree that it is necessary to make a distinction in regard
> to information intended to bring transparency, to improve accountability and
> to reduce corruption, falling under Sections 4(1)(b) and (c) and other
> information which may not have a bearing on accountability or reducing
> corruption. The competent authorities under the RTI W.P.(C) 845/2014 Page 10
> of 11 Act will have to maintain a proper balance so that while achieving
> transparency, the demand for information does not reach unmanageable
> proportions affecting other public interests, which include efficient
> operation of public authorities and the Government, preservation of
> confidentiality of sensitive information and optimum use of limited fiscal
> resources."

> (emphasis supplied)

> 10\. Consequently, this Court deems it appropriate to refuse to exercise its
> writ jurisdiction. Accordingly, present petition is dismissed. This Court is
> also of the view that misuse of the RTI Act has to be appropriately dealt
> with, otherwise the public would lose faith and confidence in this "sunshine
> Act". A beneficent Statute, when made a tool for mischief and abuse must be
> checked in accordance with law. A copy of this order is directed to be sent
> by the Registry to Defence and Law Ministry, so that they may examine the
> aspect of misuse of this Act, which confers very important and valuable
> rights upon a citizen.
