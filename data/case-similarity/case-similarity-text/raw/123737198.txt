BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J

1\. This appeal has been filed against the judgement dated 20.07.2015
delivered by a learned single judge of this court in CS (OS) 2065/2015. By
virtue of the impugned judgement the learned single judge has dismissed a suit
filed by the appellant/plaintiff on the ground that this court does not have
the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the same. The said dismissal of the
suit was in limine, without requiring the presence of the defendants /
respondents.

2\. The suit was filed by the appellant/plaintiff seeking an injunction
against the defendants, alleging infringement of its trademark "AMRAPALI". The
appellant / plaintiff, as alleged in the plaint, carries on the business of
building, developing, colonising and promoting residential, commercial and
industrial buildings, cinema houses, amusement parks, hotels and deals in all
kinds of immovable properties. It is further alleged that the appellant /
plaintiff (Ultra Home Construction Private Limited) is the flagship company of
the AMRAPALI GROUP and has a number of other affiliate/associate companies in
which it has a controlling stake either by itself or through the shareholding
members or has common directors and shareholders. It is further alleged that
due to the popularity of the appellant company and its trademark AMRAPALI, the
same has become the mark of the group as such and that is how the entire group
is known as the AMRAPALI GROUP. According to the appellant / plaintiff, the
AMRAPALI GROUP is the leader in real estate development industry. It is
further stated in the plaint that the appellant / plaintiff has its principal
place of business (registered office) at 307, Third floor, Nipun Tower,
Community Centre, Karkardooma, Delhi-92.

FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 2 of 26

3\. It is also stated in the plaint that the plaintiff/appellant is inter alia
operating a hotel at Deogarh, Jharkhand in association with Clark-Inn hotel
group. The said hotel is being run under the name - Amrapali Clark-Inn. It is
alleged that the defendants/respondents have launched a residential project at
Deogarh, Jharkhand under a deceptively similar name - AMBAPALI GREEN.
Paragraph 39 of the plaint is relevant and is set out herein below:-

> "39. That the defendants are purportedly launched residential project by the
> deceptively similar name i.e. AMBAPALI GREEN which shall definitely create
> confusion in the mind of general public who will start considering this
> project as an extension of plaintiff's earlier project AMRAPALI GREEN. The
> plaintiff's has long back presence in the town of Deogarh (Jharkhand) where
> the defendants have launched the impugned project AMBAPALI GREEN. The
> plaintiff has its hotel in Deogarh which is operational and running in
> profit and plaintiff's trademark has been known to the local residents and
> tourists who throng to that place for worship. It is pertinent to mention
> here that plaintiff's project Amrapali Green is a successful group housing
> residential complex having sprawling ambience and consisting of
> approximately 354 flats/apartments of varying sizes in Indira Puram,
> Ghaziabad. The project has already been completed in 2008 and possession has
> been handed over to the respective customers. The launch of impugned project
> is a calculated move of defendants to injure the plaintiff in his trade or
> business by unfair competition. By launching project of deceptively similar
> name, the defendants have made false representation to prospective customers
> about his business to pass off its goods as the goods of plaintiff. The
> impugned project is also launched with the illegal FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 3 of
> 26 motive to reduce force or value of plaintiff's trademark and to gradually
> tamper the commercial value of its marks and reputation slice by slice."

Paragraph 52 of the plaint, through which the territorial jurisdiction of this
court is invoked, is relevant and is set out below:-

> "52. That this Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain
> and decide the present suit as the plaintiff operates in Delhi through its
> registered office at: 307, 3rd floor, Nipun Tower, Community Centre,
> Karkardooma, Delhi-92. The plaintiff company carries on its business in
> Delhi through its several exclusive agents. The plaintiff has extensive
> goodwill and reputation under the said trademark on account of voluminous
> sales and advertisement within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. By
> virtue of above said this Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction
> within the meaning of section 134 (2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and also
> under section 62 (2) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and the Code of Civil
> Procedure, 1908."

4\. It is evident that the appellant/plaintiff had invoked the jurisdiction of
this court on the ground that its principal office (registered office) was
located in Delhi and that, therefore, it carried on business in Delhi.
Consequently, it was stated that this court has territorial jurisdiction
within the meaning of section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and also
under FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 4 of 26 section 62(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957
and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\. The learned single judge, placing
reliance on the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing
Rights Society Ltd v. Sanjay Dalia: (2015) 10 SCC 161, disagreed. The learned
single judge also observed as under:-

> "7. I may note that it is conceded on behalf of the plaintiff that at the
> place where the defendants are infringing the trademark at the ogre,
> Jharkhand, plaintiff has a hotel, and if the plaintiff as a hotel can surely
> the plaintiff is carrying on business at that particular place and carrying
> on of the hotel business is very much a part of carrying on of the business
> of the plaintiff and therefore the race of the judgement in Indian
> Performing Rights Society Ltd's case (supra) clearly applies. The plaintiff
> is running the hotel with the Clark-Inn Hotel Group i.e. plaintiff company
> does have a share in the profits and losses in the hotel which is being run
> along with the Clark-Inn Hotel Group at the Deogarh, Jharkhand. Once that is
> so, there is a running business and plaintiff is therefore carrying on
> business at Deogarh, Jharkhand, and consequently the ratio of the judgement
> in the case of Indian performing rights Society Ltd (supra) applies and
> hence this court would not have territorial jurisdiction."

5\. The learned counsel for the appellant / plaintiff submitted that the
learned single judge had not correctly appreciated the finding and the ratio
of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Sanjay Dalia (supra). It
FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 5 of 26 was contended that the Supreme Court did not hold
that the jurisdiction of the court where the principal place of business or
the registered office of the proprietor of the registered trademark and that
of the copyright was situated would be ousted if the cause of action had
arisen at another place where the plaintiff also had some activities. It was
contended that the learned single judge erred in dismissing the suit of the
plaintiff/appellant and in holding that this court did not have territorial
jurisdiction although the registered office of the appellant/plaintiff was
located in Delhi, merely on the ground that the appellant/plaintiff owned a
hotel named "AMRAPALI CLARKS INN" at Deogarh, the place where the cause of
action arose. Placing reliance on the Supreme Court decision in Dhoda House v.
SK Maingi: (2006) 9 SCC 41 it was contended that merely owning a hotel at a
place would not mean the carrying on of business at that place. It was
submitted that even though the appellant/plaintiff has a hotel at Deogarh,
Jharkhand it cannot be said that it is carrying on business at Deogarh,
Jharkhand. It was also contended that the learned single judge had erred in
law in dismissing the suit in limine. It was submitted that the learned single
judge, if he found that this court did not have the territorial jurisdiction
to entertain the suit, could only have returned the plaint to the
appellant/plaintiff for filing FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 6 of 26 before a court of
competent jurisdiction and the suit could not have been dismissed in limine.

6\. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that
the learned single judge had correctly held that this court does not have
territorial jurisdiction for entertaining the suit. It was contended that the
appellant/plaintiff had clearly admitted that it was carrying on business at
Deogarh, Jharkhand inasmuch as it had a hotel, albeit in collaboration with
Clarks Inn, at that place. It was also admitted that the alleged cause of
action had arisen at Deogarh, Jharkhand because it was alleged that the
defendants/respondents had established a residential project at that place by
the name of "AMBAPALI GREEN". All the respondents, as would be evident from
the memo of parties itself, reside and/or carry on business at Deogarh,
Jharkhand. Therefore, it is Deogarh, Jharkhand where the suit could have been
filed and not Delhi since no part of the cause of action arose in Delhi. The
mere fact that the appellant/plaintiff had its principal office (registered
office) in Delhi would not enable it to file the suit in Delhi because the
cause of action arose at Deogarh which was a place where it carried on its
business. It was FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 7 of 26 submitted that the learned
single judge had correctly understood and applied the ratio of the supreme
court decision in Sanjay Dalia (supra).

7\. It would be necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the code'), the Trade Marks
Act, 1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957. They are as under:- Section 20 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:

> "20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action
> arises.--Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be
> instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction--

> (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one,
> at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily
> resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or

> (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the
> commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on
> business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either
> the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or
> carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in
> such institution; or

> (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. Explanation.--A
> corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal
> office in India or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place
> where it has also a subordinate office, at such place."

> (underlining added) Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999:-

FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 8 of 26

> "134. Suit for infringement, etc. to be instituted before District
> Court.--(1) No suit--
    
    
                (a)      for the infringement of a registered trade mark; or
                (b)      relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or
                (c)       for passing off arising out of the use by the
    

> defendant of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar
> to the plaintiff's trade mark, whether registered or unregistered, shall be
> instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to
> try the suit.

> (2) For the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) of sub- section (1), a "District
> Court having jurisdiction" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the
> Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or any other law for the time
> being in force, include a District Court within the local limits of whose
> jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other
> proceeding, the person instituting the suit or proceeding, or, where there
> are more than one such persons any of them, actually and voluntarily resides
> or carries on business or personally works for gain. Explanation.--For the
> purposes of sub-section (2), "person" includes the registered proprietor and
> the registered user."

> (underlining added) Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957:-

> "62. Jurisdiction of court over matters arising under this Chapter.--(1)
> Every suit or other civil proceeding arising under this Chapter in respect
> of the infringement of copyright in any work or the infringement of any
> other right conferred by this Act shall be instituted in the district court
> having jurisdiction.

> include a district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at
> the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person
> instituting the suit or other proceeding or, where there are more than one
> such persons, any of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on
> business or personally works for gain."

> (underlining added)

> 8\. On examining the provisions of section 20 of the code, it is evident
> that a defendant could be sued inter alia where the defendant carried on
> business. If the defendant was a corporation (which expression includes a
> company), by virtue of the explanation after clause (c), it would be deemed
> to carry on business:-

> (1) if it had a sole office in India then at the place of the sole office;

> (2) if it had a principal office at one place as well as a subordinate
> office at another place then:-

> (i) in case the cause of action arose at the place of the subordinate place,
> at that place; or

> (ii) in case no part of the cause of action arose at the place of the
> subordinate office, at the place of the principal office.

> 9\. This position was explained in Patel Roadways Ltd. v. Prasad Trading
> Co.: (1991) 4 SCC 270, as follows:-

FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 10 of 26

> "12. We would also like to add that the interpretation sought to be placed
> by the appellant on the provision in question renders the Explanation
> totally redundant. If the intention of the legislature was, as is said on
> their behalf, that a suit against a corporation could be instituted either
> at the place of its sole or principal office (whether or not the corporation
> carries on business at that place) or at any other place where the cause of
> action arises, the provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) together with the
> first part of the Explanation would have completely achieved the purpose.
> Indeed the effect would have been wider. The suit could have been instituted
> at the place of the principal office because of the situation of such office
> (whether or not any actual business was carried on there). Alternatively, a
> suit could have been instituted at the place where the cause of action arose
> under clause (c) (irrespective of whether the corporation had a subordinate
> office in such place or not). This was, therefore, not the purpose of the
> Explanation. The Explanation is really an Explanation to clause (a). It is
> in the nature of a clarification on the scope of clause (a) viz. as to where
> the corporation can be said to carry on business. This, it is clarified,
> will be the place where the principal office is situated (whether or not any
> business actually is carried on there) or the place where a business is
> carried on giving rise to a cause of action (even though the principal
> office of the corporation is not located there) so long as there is a
> subordinate office of the corporation situated at such place. The linking
> together of the place where the cause of action arises with the place where
> a subordinate office is located clearly shows that the intention of the
> legislature was that, in the case of a corporation, for the purposes of
> clause (a), the location of the subordinate office, within the local limits
> of which a cause of action arises, is to be the relevant place for the
> filing of a suit and not the principal place of business. If the intention
> was that the location of the sole or principal office as well as the
> location of the subordinate office (within the limits of which a cause of
> action arises) are to be deemed to be places where the corporation is deemed
> to be carrying FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 11 of 26 on business, the disjunctive
> "or" will not be there. Instead, the second part of the Explanation would

> it has a subordinate office, also at such place".

> 13\. As far as we can see the interpretation which we have placed on this

> 10\. This view was endorsed in New Moga Transport Co. v. United India
> Insurance Co. Ltd: (2004) 4 SCC 677 as follows:

FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 12 of 26

> "9. Normally, under clauses (a) to (c) the plaintiff has a choice of forum
> and cannot be compelled to go to the place of residence or business of the

> If the defendant desires to be protected from being dragged into a

> to a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant inter
> alia "carries on business". Clause (c) on the other hand refers to a court
> within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the cause of action wholly or
> in part arises.

> 10\. On a plain reading of the Explanation to Section 20 CPC it is clear
> that the Explanation consists of two parts: (i) before the word "or"
> appearing between the words "office in India" and the words "in respect of",
> and (ii) the other thereafter. The Explanation applies to a defendant which

> whose jurisdiction the sole or principal office of the company is situate
> will also have jurisdiction inasmuch as even if the defendant may not
> actually be carrying on business at that place, it will be deemed to carry
> on business at that place because of the fiction created by the Explanation.
> The latter part of the Explanation takes care of a case where the defendant
> does not have a sole office but has a principal office at one place and has
> also a subordinate office at another place. The expression "at such place"
> appearing in the Explanation and the word "or" which is disjunctive clearly
> suggest that if the case falls within the latter part of the Explanation it
> is not the court FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 13 of 26 within whose jurisdiction the
> principal office of the defendant is situate but the court within whose
> jurisdiction it has a subordinate office which alone has the jurisdiction
> "in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a
> subordinate office".

> 11\. Section 20, before the amendment of CPC in 1976, had two Explanations
> being Explanations I and II. By the Amendment Act, Explanation I was omitted
> and Explanation II was renumbered as the present Explanation. Explanation
> which was omitted reads as follows: "Explanation I.--Where a person has a
> permanent dwelling at one place and also a temporary residence at another
> place, he shall be deemed to reside at both places in respect of any cause
> of action arising at the place where he has such temporary residence."

> 12\. This Explanation dealt with the case of place of residence of the
> defendant and provided with regard to a person having a permanent dwelling
> at one place and also temporary at another place, that such person shall be
> deemed to reside at both places in respect of any cause of action arising at
> the place where he has such temporary residence. The language used in
> Explanation II, on the other hand, which is the present Explanation, was
> entirely different. Had the intention been that if a corporation had its
> principal office at one place and a subordinate office at another place and
> the cause of action arose at the place where it had its subordinate office
> it shall be deemed to be carrying on business at both places, the language
> used in Explanation II would have been identical to that of Explanation I
> which was dealing with a case of a person having a permanent dwelling at one
> place and also temporary residence at another place."

> 11\. Thus, for the purpose of section 20 of the Code, a company having both
> a principal office and a subordinate office at a different place would be
> deemed to carry on business either at the principal office or at the place
> of the subordinate office but not at both places. If the cause of action

> subordinate office then the company would be deemed to carry on business at
> the place of its principal office.

12\. By virtue of the Supreme Court decision in Sanjay Dalia (supra) this
deeming provision contained in the explanation in section 20 of the Code has
been read into section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and section 62(2)
of the Copyright Act, 1957 for the purposes of isolating the place where the
plaintiff can be said to carry on business. It will be noted that though the
expression "carries on business" is used in all the three provisions (i.e.,
section 20 of the Code, section 134(2) of the Trade marks Act, 1999 and
section 62(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957), the deeming provision contained in
the Explanation in section 20 of the Code has not FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 15 of
26 been expressly incorporated in the other two provisions. But, the Supreme
Court has, in the said decision, given the expression "carries on business"
used in relation to a corporation in the context of a defendant in section 20
of the Code the same meaning when it is used in relation to a plaintiff under
the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). It would be instructive to note the
following observations of the Supreme Court in the said decision:

> "14. Considering the very language of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and
> Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, an additional forum has been provided by
> including a District Court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and
> voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. The
> object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to institute a suit at
> a place where he or they resided or carried on business, not to enable them
> to drag the defendant further away from such a place also as is being done
> in the instant cases. In our opinion, the expression "notwithstanding
> anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure" does not oust the
> applicability of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure
> and it is clear that additional remedy has been provided to the plaintiff so
> as to file a suit where he is residing or carrying on business, etc. as the
> case may be. Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff
> to file a suit where the defendant resides or where cause of action arose.
> Section 20(a) and Section 20(b) usually provides the venue where the
> defendant or any of them resides, carries on business or personally works
> for gain. Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff
> to institute a suit where the cause of action wholly or in part, arises. The
> Explanation to Section 20 CPC has been added to the effect that corporation
> shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in
> India or in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has
> subordinate office at such FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 16 of 26 place. Thus,
> "corporation" can be sued at a place having its sole or principal office and
> where cause of action wholly or in part, arises at a place where it has also
> a subordinate office at such place.

> 15\. The learned author Mulla in Code of Civil Procedure, 18th Edn., has
> observed that under clauses (a) to (c) of Section 20, the plaintiff has a
> choice of forum to institute a suit. The intendment of the Explanation to
> Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure is that once the corporation has a
> subordinate office in the place where the cause of action arises wholly or
> in part, it cannot be heard to say that it cannot be sued there because it
> did not carry on business at that place. The linking of the place with the
> cause of action in the Explanation where subordinate office of the
> corporation is situated is reflective of the intention of the legislature
> and such a place has to be the place of the filing of the suit and not the
> principal place of business. Ordinarily the suit has to be filed at the
> place where there is principal place of business of the corporation."

13\. It is evident from the above observations that the interpretation given
to the expression "carries on business" in the context of a defendant under
section 20 of the Code has also been employed in the context of a plaintiff
under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). Thus, in addition to the places
where suits could be filed under section 20 of the Code, the plaintiff can FAO
(OS) 494/15 Page 20 of 26 also institute a suit under the Trade Marks Act,
1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957, as the case may be, by taking advantage of
the provisions of section 134(2) or section 62(2), respectively. Both the
latter provisions are in pari materia. Under these provisions four situations
can be contemplated in the context of the plaintiff being a corporation (which
includes a company). First of all, is the case where the plaintiff has a sole
office. In such a case, even if the cause of action has arisen at a different
place, the plaintiff can institute a suit at the place of the sole office.
Next is the case where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and a
subordinate or branch office at another place and the cause of action has
arisen at the place of the principal office. In such a case, the plaintiff may
sue at the place of the principal office but cannot sue at the place of the
subordinate office. The third case is where the plaintiff has a principal
office at one place and the cause of action has arisen at the place where its
subordinate office is located. In this eventuality, the plaintiff would be
deemed to carry on business at the place of his subordinate office and not at
the place of the principal office. Thus, the plaintiff could sue at the place
of the subordinate office and cannot sue (under the scheme of the provisions
of section 134(2) and 62(2)) at the place of the principal office. The fourth
case is where the cause of action neither arises at the place of the principal
FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 21 of 26 office nor at the place of the subordinate
office but at some other place. In this case, the plaintiff would be deemed to
carry on business at the place of its principal office and not at the place of
the subordinate office. And, consequently, it could institute a suit at the
place of its principal office but not at the place of its subordinate office.
All these four cases are set out in the table below for greater clarity:

    
    
    S.No. Place         of      Place       of Place where Place         where

                                                            section 62(2)

      2               A                B               A                 A

      4               A                B               C                 A
    
    
    
    14.     The present case falls under S. No. 3 in the above table.             The
    
    appellant / plaintiff has its principal office in Delhi (place A).                 Its
    
    

subordinate office is at Deogarh, Jharkhand (place B) where it runs one of its
hotels (Amrapali Clarks Inn), albeit in collaboration with Clarks Inn hotels.
The alleged cause of action has accrued at Deogarh, Jharkhand FAO (OS) 494/15
Page 22 of 26 (place B). Therefore, the appellant/plaintiff could, in respect
of the alleged cause of action in this suit, institute a suit against the
defendants at Deogarh, Jharkhand (place B) but not in Delhi. Thus, the
conclusion arrived at by the learned single judge that this court did not have
the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit cannot be faulted.

15\. We may point out that the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff had
also urged that there was some conflict between the decisions of the Supreme
Court in Dhodha House (supra) and Sanjay Dalia (supra). But, that argument is
not available to the learned counsel for multiple reasons. The first and only
reason that we may allude to is that in Sanjay Dalia (supra) itself, the
Supreme Court, considered its decision in Dhodha House (supra) and held that
there was nothing in the interpretation put forth in Sanjay Dalia (supra)
which militated against the observations / conclusions in Dhodha House. The
exact language used by the Supreme Court on this aspect is as under:-

> "42. In Dhodha House [Dhodha House v. S.K. Maingi, (2006) 9 SCC 41] , the
> question which is posed before us did not come up for consideration and it
> has been observed that the Act provides for an additional forum. Such
> additional forum was provided so as to enable a plaintiff who may not be FAO
> (OS) 494/15 Page 23 of 26 otherwise in a position to file a suit at
> different places where the copyright was violated. We have anxiously
> considered the aforesaid observations made and the object of the Act, we
> find that the interpretation made by us does not militate against the
> observations made by this Court in Dhodha House [Dhodha House v. S.K.
> Maingi, (2006) 9 SCC 41] , the precise question which is before us, was not
> involved in the aforesaid case. A decision is not to be construed like a
> statute nor by inferential process can it be assumed that this Court has
> decided the question also which is before this Court in the instant cases."

16\. Interestingly, in the present case, even if the deeming fiction of the
Explanation in section 20 of the Code is not imported into either of the said
sections 134(2) or 62(2), on the basis of the averments made in the plaint
itself it becomes clear that the plaintiff carries on business at, inter alia,
Deogarh. In Dhodha House (supra) itself it was observed as follows:

> "46. The expression "carries on business" and the expression "personally
> works for gain" connote two different meanings. For the purpose of carrying
> on business only presence of a man at a place is not necessary. Such
> business may be carried on at a place through an agent or a manager or
> through a servant. The owner may not even visit that place. The phrase
> "carries on business" at a certain place would, therefore, mean having an
> interest in a business at that place, a voice in what is done, a share in
> the gain or loss and some control thereover....."

> (underlining added) FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 24 of 26

> 17\. The appellant / plaintiff has a clear and admitted interest in the
> business of its hotel - Amrapali Clarks Inn - at Deogarh. On the basis of
> the averments in the plaint, the plaintiff carries on business through the
> said hotel at Deogarh. To recapitulate, the plaintiff had stated the

> "The plaintiff's has long back presence in the town of Deogarh (Jharkhand)
> where the defendants have launched the impugned project AMBAPALI GREEN. The
> plaintiff has its hotel in Deogarh which is operational and running in
> profit and plaintiff's trademark has been known to the local residents and
> tourists who throng to that place for worship."

> (underlining added)

> 18\. Clearly, on the basis of the averments in the plaint itself and in the
> backdrop of the observations in Dhodha House (supra), the appellant /
> plaintiff carries on business in Deogarh, Jharkhand. It may also carry on
> business at Delhi. But, because the cause of action has allegedly arisen in

> FAO (OS) 494/15 Page 25 of 26 this court did not have jurisdiction, the
> plaint ought to have been returned under order 7 rule 10 CPC. Only to that
> extent, the learned single judge had erred.

19\. In sum, the dismissal of the suit is set aside. Since this court does not
have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit, the plaint is
directed to be returned to the appellant/plaintiff for presentation before the
proper court. The appeal stands disposed of. The parties shall bear their own
costs.
