    :      MOOL CHAND GARG,J
    
    

1\. This appeal arises out of an order dated 07.02.2005 passed by the ld.
Additional District Judge in Suit No.107/2003, whereby the learned Judge has
dismissed the application filed by the appellant under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2
CPC r/w Section 151 CPC seeking injunction against the respondent for
injuncting them from selling their goods under the trade mark "HIMWARE" on the
pretext that the appellant company is manufacturing sanitary wares and other
allied products which are used in toilet and bathroom fittings since decade.
The products of the appellant company were being sold under the trade
name/trade mark "H-VITREOUS" since 1960. According to them, they added
"HINDWARE" to their existing trademark since 1990 and got it registered.

2\. It is also their case that they garnered the lion‟s share in the sale of
sanitary wares and their products command very high reputation and goodwill
amongst their consumer. It is also their case that the respondent by using
deceptively similar trade mark in the same class of FAO No.95/2005 Page 1 of
10 goods are eating market and profits of the appellant company inasmuch as,
despite the said company having come into business much later than the
appellant company precisely since 1999 have attempted to eat into the market
share of the appellant company by selling the goods under the trade mark
"HIMWARE". It is their case that the trade mark adopted by the respondent i.e.
"HIMWARE" has both colour and audible resemblance and given the fact that the
appellant has a large number of people as their customer going across various
sections of the society, uses their product, there is a strong possibility of
deception amongst them. Moreover, the appellant company being registered trade
mark holder, have a right to restrain the respondent company from using the
trademark "HIMWARE" which is deceptively similar to the trademark of appellant
and becomes all the more important since there is a potential for damage being
caused to their goodwill and reputation which partially higher as both
trademarks are used in similar type of goods. It is submitted that the
respondents by having started using trademark „HIMWARE‟ infringed the
registered trademark of the appellant and thus a prayer was made that the
respondent company be injuncted by means of injunction from selling their
products under the trademark "HIMWARE" with respect to the class of goods in
which they were manufacturing and selling their goods under the trademark "H-
VITREOUS HINDWARE".

3\. The suit/application filed by the appellant was contested by the
respondents on the ground that the appellant cannot monopolize the word
"HINDWARE" since „Hind/Hindustan‟ is the geographical name of our country
India and the word „Ware‟ is taken out from the word sanitary ware, which is
the common trade name, neither coined nor invented by the appellant,
therefore, it was pleaded that the appellant cannot be permitted to monopolize
the same. It was further stated that the trade name of the respondent‟s
product is only "HIMWARE" whereas the trademark of the appellant is
conjunction of two words i.e. HINDWARE along with VITREOUS written in between
capital H. Therefore, there is no possibility of any confusion to anyone since
the trade name/trademark are distinct from each other both visibly and
phonetically and for that matter even Structurally.

FAO No.95/2005 Page 2 of 10

4\. The learned Additional District Judge while dismissing the application of
the appellant observed that while the contentions of the appellant were
correct to the extent that there is some phonetic similarity between
"HINDWARE" and "HIMWARE" but when the entire trade mark of the appellant is
compared with the trade mark of the respondent, the similarity goes. It has
been observed:-

> "15. The counsel for the plaintiff is correct to the extent that there is
> some phonetic similarity between Hind Ware and Him Ware but when the entire
> trade mark of the plaintiff is compared with the trademark name of the
> defendant the similarity goes. The entire trade name of the plaintiff cannot
> be isolated to Hind ware rather it has to go hand in hand with H-VITREOUS.
> According to the submission of the counsel for the plaintiff the trade mark
> of the plaintiff company was H-VITREOUS since 1960 to 1990 and in the year,
> 1990 an additional word Hind Ware was added into the trade mark. The
> reputation and good-will of the plaintiff was already there with the trade
> name H-VITREOUS which has been written in a very distinctive manner as per
> the plaintiff itself. In these circumstances, the possibility is that the
> public/user rely on the initial trade mark of H-VITREOUS and when they will
> be told by the seller or would be able to derive otherwise that H-VITREOUS
> and H-VITREOUS Hind Ware is the same then for all practical purposes they
> will treat the trade mark H-VITREOUS itself. In these circumstances any
> sanitary ware sold by the name of mere Him Ware does not seems to infringe
> the trade mark of the plaintiff especially when the style of writing Him
> Ware and Hind Ware is different and above all Hind Ware in itself is nothing
> unless it is read with H-VITREOUS. From the ocular comparison of the trade
> mark/ trade name it is apparent that the two marks are distinct inasmuch as
> Him Ware is encircled in Oval shaped lines cirucumscribing it and there is
> nothing which may come near to H-VITREOUS Hind Ware. The word ware in the
> Him Ware and Hind Ware has been taken from the words sanitary ware and
> neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can be permitted monopolies this. In
> any case the other players in the field are also using the word ware in
> conjunction with different words to sell their goods, which incidentally are
> in the same class, such as Parryware. The ratio of the judgments in the
> proceedings paras supports this conclusion."

5\. After making the aforesaid observations, the Additional District Judge
further held that the two trade names are not similar nor there is any
possibility of any deception to the consumers of this class of goods and as
such, the appellant is unable to make out the prima facie case and in these
circumstances declined the prayer made by the appellant FAO No.95/2005 Page 3
of 10 in their application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 and dismissed the said
application.

6\. It is against the aforesaid order, the appellant has come in appeal. It is
the case of the appellant that the order passed by the Additional District
Judge is not sustainable inasmuch as the learned Additional District Judge has
erred in not appreciating the relative scope, ambit and differences between an
infringement action based on a registered trademark and passing off action and
thus, erred in law. It has been submitted that the impugned trade mark
"HIMWARE" used by the respondent is deceptively similar to the trademark
"HINDWARE". The user of the said trademark by the respondent amounts to an
infringement of the appellant‟s registered trademark under trademark
registration No.529823 B in Clause 11 which warrants issuance of the
injunction.

7\. It has been pleaded on behalf of the appellant that the trademark
"HIMWARE" is an essential and distinguishing feature of the appellant‟s
registered trade mark and identical and deceptively similar trade mark
"HIMWARE" adopted and used by the respondent amounts to an infringement
warranting issuance of injunction.

8\. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
M/s K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar Vs. Sri Ambalal & Co., AIR 1970 SC 146 and
M/s Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. Vs. The Zamindara Engineering Company, 1970 (2) SCR
222.

9\. It has also been submitted that the learned Additional District Judge did
a grave error in not appreciating that the trade mark has to be taken in its
entirety and as a whole and has failed to appreciate the various decisions of
the Apex Court including those reported in M/s Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs.
Satyadeo Gupta, 1963 (2) SCR 484; M/s Parle Products (P) Ltd. Vs. J.P. &
Company, Mysore, AIR 1972 SCC 1359; M/s Cadila Health Care Ltd. Vs. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., AIR 2001 SC 1952; and, M/s Hitachi Ltd. Vs. Ajay
Kr.Agarwal & Ors., 1996 PTC (16) (DB).

10\. The appellant has also filed written submissions. According to the
appellant, FAO No.95/2005 Page 4 of 10

(i) The gist of action of infringement is that the plaintiff has to show that
the defendant has copied the essential features of the registered Trade Mark.

(ii) What is important to find out is the essential and distinguishing feature
of the Trade Mark already registered. If it is found that the Trade Mark of
the defendant contains the same idea of the plaintiff‟s registered Trade Mark,
then it constitutes the infringement.

(iii) While comparing the rival Trade Marks which mandate that while comparing
marks, the two Trade Marks are not to be seen in juxtaposition.

(iv) The confusion and deception of the Trade Marks in question has to be
decided on the broad similarities and not on the dissimilarities.

(v) The ocular comparison is not the only test. Trade Marks in question can be
held to be deceptively similar even on the basis of phonetic similarity only.

(vi) While comparing two Trade Marks, it is not permissible to split the Trade
Marks. The marks have to be compared as a whole.

11\. On the basis of the aforesaid points raised for the purpose of analyzing
comparison between the two trade marks for coming to a conclusion as to
whether the trade mark, subject matter of the dispute was infringing the
registered trade mark of the appellant or nor, it has further been submitted
by the appellant that The essential feature of the appellant‟s registered
Trade mark is „HINDWARE‟. While the trademark of the respondent „HIMWARE‟. It
is submitted that essential features of both the trademarks in question are
not only phonetically similar but also similar ocular comparison. Goods
involved in question are also same.

12\. It has been submitted that the learned Trial Court ought to have
considered that the trade marks can be similar even on the basis of phonetic
similarity which fact has been acknowledged by the appellant.

FAO No.95/2005 Page 5 of 10

It was submitted that the Trial Judge was wrong in splitting the trade mark
while making the comparison of both the trademarks as a trademark has to be
compared as a whole. Various citations have been relied upon to support the
aforesaid plea by giving the following comparison in a case where the
trademark of the another party has been found to be infringing the trademark
of the one party as referred to in the chart given below:-

13\. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the respondent while
supporting the judgment delivered by the Additional District FAO No.95/2005
Page 6 of 10 Judge has been pleased to observe that if one goes by Section 17
of the Trade Mark Act and read the said provisions along with Section 29 of
the Act, it becomes apparently clear that the contentions of the appellant are
not sustainable in law because as per Section 17, for the purpose of
infringement, the entire trade mark of the appellant in toto has to be
considered for the purpose of considering if there is a violation thereof or
not. It is further submitted that the trademark of the appellant if read in
whole, makes it clear that the user of the trade mark "HIMWARE" by the
respondents in no way infringes the trade mark of the appellant and,
therefore, it is submitted that the order passed by the Additional District
Judge is perfectly legal and valid. The respondents have also relied upon
various judgments to support their contention. Reference has been made to
Kewal Krishan Kumar Vs. Rudi Roller Flour Mills (P) Ltd. & Anr., 2003 (26) PTC
175 (Delhi); S.B.L.Limited Vs. Himalaya Drug Co., AIR 1998 Delhi 126; and Amar
Singh Chawalwala Vs. Shree Warddhman Rice & General Mills,1996(36) DRJ 11.
Insofar as the last judgment is concerned, it is the case of the appellant
that the said judgment stand negatives by the Division Bench of this Court
vide judgment dated 27.09.2007 passed in OCJA No. 1/2003

14\. I have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and have also
perused the record of the case as well as gone through the judgments cited at
bar. I have also gone through the written submissions filed by the parties.
All the judgments cited by the appellant as well as by the respondent have
been referred to in a recent judgment delivered by the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Gufic Ltd. and Anr Vs Clinique Laboratories, LLC and Anr,
MIPR 2010 (2) 411, wherein this court after referring the couple of above
mentioned judgments had culled out the following principles:-

> 1\. The test of deceptive similarity in the case of infringement is the same
> as in a passing off action, where the marks are not identical;

> 2\. The question has to be approached from the point of view of a man with
> average intelligence and imperfect recollection;

> 3\. In comparing the marks, it is the overall structural and phonetic
> similarity of the two marks that is to be seen and not by splitting them
> into their component FAO No.95/2005 Page 7 of 10 parts and to consider the
> etymological meaning thereof;

> 4\. The trademark is the whole thing - the whole word has to be considered;
> and

> 5\. In comparing the two marks, it is also to be seen whether they both
> convey the same idea - (test of commonness of the idea between the two
> marks).

15\. In the same judgment the Division Bench has further observed that:

> 23\. It is in this backdrop that we have to compare the marks of the
> appellants and those of the respondents. The respondents' registered
> trademark is 'CLINIQUE'. It also has other registered trademarks which all
> include the word 'CLINIQUE'. 'CLINIQUE' is a French word for the English
> word 'Clinic'. Both are pronounced differently. 'CLINIC is pronounced as
> 'KLINIK' and 'CLINIQUE' is pronounced as "KLINECK". "CLINIQUE" is the most
> important constituent of the respondents' family of trademarks. The question
> is, whether the mark of the appellants - "SKINCLINIQ" is deceptively similar
> to 'CLINIQUE' or not? It is apparent, as already pointed out above, that
> "CLINIQUE" and "SKINCLINIQ" are not identical marks. The question,
> therefore, is to find out as to whether they are deceptively similar or not
> and this question has to be approached from the point of view of a man with
> an average intelligence and an imperfect recollection. In comparing
> 'CLINIQUE' with 'SKINCLINIQ', what has to be borne in mind is the overall
> structural and phonetic similarity of the two marks and the marks cannot be
> separated into their components. Consequently, we have to take the mark
> 'SKINCLINIQ' as a whole in comparison with the respondents' registered mark
> 'CLINIQUE'. When we do that, we do not find any overall structural or
> phonetic similarity. We cannot separate the mark 'SKINCLINIQ' into its
> component parts 'SKIN' and 'CLINIQ' and then compare the component 'CLINIQ'
> with the respondents mark 'CLINIQUE'. If such a splitting up cannot be done,
> then we do not see any phonetic, visual or overall structural similarity in
> the two marks, 'CLINIQUE' and 'SKINCLINIQ', so as to reach to the conclusion
> that 'SKINCLINIQ' is deceptively similar to 'CLINIQUE'. The word 'Clinic' by
> itself means a place where some kind of treatment is provided. So, perhaps,
> it could be said that the word 'CLINIQUE' conveys the idea of some kind of
> treatment. To a certain extent, it may be said that the mark 'CLINIQUE' and
> the mark 'SKINCLINIQ' do convey a common idea of treatment. However, as
> pointed out above, while comparing the marks, we have to examine not only
> the commonness of the idea between the two marks, but also the overall
> visual, structural and phonetic similarity of the marks. Taking an overall
> view of the marks, we feel that a person of average FAO No.95/2005 Page 8 of
> 10 intelligence and imperfect recollection would not be deceived by the mark
> 'SKINCLINIQ' into believing that it is, in fact, the mark 'CLINIQUE'. We
> feel that the learned single judge fell into error in splitting the
> appellants' mark "SKINCLINIQ" into 'SKIN' and 'CLINIQ' and in then comparing
> the latter component (CLINIQ) with the respondents' mark 'CLINIQUE'. Had the
> appellants' mark been only 'CLINIQ' then, perhaps, it could be said that it
> is deceptively similar to the respondents' mark 'CLINIQUE'. However, the
> appellants' mark is not just 'CLINIQ' but 'SKINCLINIQ', which is one word
> and not two separate words as in Rustam's case and Cleanzo's case.

> 24\. Another important circumstance is that the price differential between
> the two products is so vast that no consumer of products of either the
> appellant or the respondent would confuse one for the other. We, therefore,
> do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned single Judge
> that, prima facie, a case of infringement has been made out.

16\. In the instant case though it is correct to the extent that there is some
phonetic similarity between Hind ware and Him ware but when the entire trade
mark of the appellant is compared with the trademark of the respondent the
similarity goes. The entire trade name of the appellant cannot be isolated to
Hind ware rather it has to go hand in hand with H-VITREOUS. More so, even from
the ocular comparison of the trade mark/trade name it is apparent that the two
marks are distinct in as much as Him Ware is encircled in Oval shaped lines
circumscribing it and there is nothing which may come near to H- VITREOUS Hind
ware. Moreover, the word ware in Hind ware and Him ware is concerned, it has
been taken from the words sanitary ware and neither the appellant nor the
respondent can be permitted to monopolies this. Thus in the light of the above
as well as when the trademarks are put to the test of being considered from
point of view of a man with average intelligence and imperfect re-collection,
it does not get proved that the trademark of the respondent is deceptively
similar to the trademark of the appellant. In view of the aforesaid,
submissions made by the appellant are of no help to the case of the appellant.

17\. Therefore having said so, I do not find any infirmity in the order passed
by the Learned Additional District judge. In view of the aforesaid, I find no
infirmity in the order passed by the learned FAO No.95/2005 Page 9 of 10
Additional District Judge in having dismissed the application filed by the
appellant under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC. Consequently, the appeal is
dismissed with no orders as to costs. It is however made clear that nothing
stated herein would cause any prejudice or any aspersion on the merits of the
case. The Additional District Judge is however directed to dispose of the suit
itself within one year from the date of the appearance of the parties, who
shall appear before the Additional District Judge on the date already fixed
before the Additional District Judge.

18\. A copy of this order be sent to the trial Court along with record.
C.M.5391/2005(stay) Interim orders stand vacated.

Application is disposed of.
