      BEFORE:
    
      The Hon'ble JUSTICE ARIJIT BANERJEE
    
      Date : 6th August, 2014.
    
                                               Mr.Pradip Kumar Dutta, Sr. Advocate
                                               Mr.R. Dutta, Advocate
                                               Mr.Sayantan Bose, Advocate
                                               Mr.Partha Pratim Naskar, Advocate
                                               for the plaintiff.
    
                                               Mr.Aniruddha Ray, Advocate
                                               Ms.Debosmita Dutta, Advocate
                                               for the respondent.

The Court : These suits are all money suits. The plaintiff has filed
applications for judgment upon admission. I am told that affidavits are
complete in those applications.

The defendant has filed applications for revocation of leave granted under
Clause 12 of the Letters Patent and for rejection of the plaint in all the 23
matters.

In an order dated 17th September, 2012 it was recorded that the plaintiff does
not wish to use any affidavit-in-opposition in respect of the defendant's
application.

Mr.Pradip Kumar Dutta, learned senior Counsel appearing for the defendant,
states today that from time to time the matters appeared before the
Interlocutory Court but the plaintiff did not seek leave to file any
affidavit-in- opposition to the defendant's application. However, when the
matter came up before the Court on 30th July, 2014, the plaintiff prayed for
time to file affidavit- in-opposition to the defendant's application. This was
strongly opposed on behalf of the defendant. However, this Court recorded an
order to the following effect :

> "List the applications appearing against serial no. 133 to 155 of today's
> list on 6th August 2014 as the first batch of "Adjourned Motion"
> irrespective of any part-heard matter.

> The plaintiffs will be entitled to file in Court affidavits-in- opposition
> in as many of these matters as may be made ready by them. This is in view of
> Mr. Talukdar's submission that affidavits-in- opposition in all the matters
> may not be made ready by 6th August 2014\.

> When the matters will be called for hearing on the next date Mr. Dutta,
> learned senior advocate will be put to a choice whether he wants to file any
> reply or not and if he does not wish to file a reply he may proceed with the
> order VII Rule 11 applications".

Today, Mr.Aniruddha Ray, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff,
has come up with affidavits-in-opposition to the defendant's application in 19
out of 23 matters. Let the affidavits be taken on record.  6

It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that the defendant is aggrieved by
the order dated 30th July, 2014 and is in the process of filing an appeal
against the said order.

Let the matters stand adjourned till August 18, 2014 and appear under the
heading 'Adjourned Motion'. Affidavits-in-Reply, if any, be filed in the
meantime.

This order is being passed without prejudice to the rights and contentions of
the parties.
