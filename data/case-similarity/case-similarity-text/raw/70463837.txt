C.M. 5125/2017

1\. This is an application on behalf of the respondent no.8/NASVI for placing
on record additional documents. Prima facie we are of the view that the
application is merely an attempt to further prolong the W.P. (C ) 2556/2015
Page 1 of 50 litigation after the judgment was reserved on 01.02.2017, but
since we have considered the documents sought to be placed on record, the
application is allowed.

2\. The application is disposed of.

W.P. (C) 2556/2015

3\. The present writ petition has been filed by Vyapari Kalyan Mandal Main
Pushpa (Central) Market Lajpat Nagar under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India for issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to
restrain/remove squatters, vendors and hawkers vending in a „No Squatting
Zone‟ at Central/Pushpa Market, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. The petitioner no.1
association comprises of shopkeepers carrying on trade and business in the
said market, while the petitioner no.2 is a member of the association carrying
on his business from shop no. 90.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS

4\. The facts of the case as stated in this writ petition are that on
21.05.1996 a massive bomb blast took place in the area of Pushpa Market,
Lajpat Nagar-II, in which 13 people died, several persons were injured and
there was a loss of several crores of goods. A high- level enquiry was ordered
by the then Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. The report was submitted to the
Lieutenant Governor, as per which the casualties and loss of property was due
to delay in reaching the site by emergency services on account of
encroachments by squatters/hawkers in the lanes and by-lanes of Central/Pushpa
Market. It was recommended that no squatting/hawking should be permitted in
future in the said area.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 2 of 50

5\. On the basis of the enquiry report, the Lieutenant Governor by his order
dated 13.11.1996 directed the authorities to clear all the roads, lanes and
by-lanes in Central/Pushpa Market, Lajpat Nagar of all encroachments in a
joint operation to be conducted by the MCD and the police. The Lieutenant
Governor also declared the entire Central/Pushpa Market as a „No Squatting
Zone‟.

6\. In Gainda Ram and others v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and others,
W.P. (C) No.1699/1987 pending before the Supreme Court, I.A. Nos.340-348 were
filed by those who were carrying on tehbazari facing Blocks D & J, Lajpat
Nagar-II who had been removed after the bomb blast. By order dated 04.08.2000
in the said I.As., the Supreme Court directed the Government of NCT of Delhi
to look into the matter and inform the Court whether Blocks D & J could be
declared as squatting areas in view of the fact that certain other areas close
to the place where bomb blast has taken place are being used for squatting
purposes.

7\. In response to the order, an affidavit was filed by Dr. B.S. Banerjee,
Additional Secretary, Department of Urban Development, Government of India
inter alia stating that:

> "5. That the action of the MCD in permitting tehbazari in sites closer to
> the bomb blast site even while excluding Blocks "D and J" is not sustainable
> and the Lieutenant Governor is of the view that it would be appropriate to
> permit tehbazari only on sites or squatting zones properly selected in
> accordance with the directions of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in its order
> dated 1.5.1997 in I.A. Nos.37, IA No.97 in W.P. (C) No.1699 of 1987 with

> (C) No.12618 of 1992 in CWP No.1699 of 1997 in the W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page
> 3 of 50 matter of Gainda Ram and others Vs. MCD and others and not
> permitting this in any non-squatting zones."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 8\. On 01.12.2000 in I.A. Nos. 336, 340-348 in W.P. (C) No.1699 of 1987, the
> Supreme Court taking into consideration the aforegoing affidavit passed the
> following order:

> "If it is the policy decision of the Government of NCT of Delhi to maintain
> the earlier prohibitory orders dated 13.11.1996 of the Lt. Governor to clear
> all roads, lanes and bye-lanes of all encroachments in that area and now a
> further decision has also been taken that the MCD ought not to have
> permitted tehbazari in some pockets closer to the Bomb Blast Site. Then
> there is no question of excluding Blocks "D and J" from the purview of
> prohibition contained in the earlier orders of the Lt. Governor. Not will
> Blocks "D and J" be treated as non-squatting area but the areas which are
> shown in the same plan closer to the Bomb Blast site. Where MCD has
> permitted tehbazari will now be treated as non-squatting area and all those
> who are occupying those areas will be removed from that area and provided
> tehbazari site for squatting in accordance with their seniority elsewhere.
> ..."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 9\. The aforesaid stand was reiterated by the MCD in its affidavit, dated
> 27.02.2001 filed before the Supreme Court by Sh. O.P. Balwani, Assistant
> Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Delhi inter alia stating:

> "[C] In the area of Pushpa Market a massive Bomb Blast had taken place on
> 21st May, 1996 in which 13 people had died and a high level Enquiry was
> ordered by the Lieutenant Governor and in the said Enquiry report it was
> recommended that no squatters should be permitted in the said area. On 1st

> the response of Lt. Governor‟s office and according this Hon‟ble Court had
> W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 4 of 50 declared that no squatting will be allowed
> in the area of Pushpa Market. Even otherwise, Municipal Corporation of Delhi
> had already declared Pushpa Market as a non- squatting area and as such
> applicants under no circumstances can be allowed to squat in the said area.
> As per order dated 1st December, 2000 passed by this Hon‟ble Court in
> Contempt Petition No.288-289/2000 squatting in a non-squatting area has been
> prohibited. ..."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 10\. On 25.08.2005 in I.A. No.394 in I.A. No.356 in W.P. (C) 1699/1987 in
> the order passed by the Supreme Court as regards demarcation of hawking and

> hawkers/squatters will be located only in those zones which have been
> demarcated by the NDMC and MCD as hawking zones in accordance with the
> priorities mentioned in the Scheme..."

> 11\. The Assistant Commissioner, Central Zone, MCD by its letter dated
> 30.12.2005 rejected the choice for squatting sites at Pushpa/Central Market
> by the applicants in I.A. No.394 before the Supreme Court informing that:

> "Following the above observation of the Hon‟ble Court the choice submitted

> Zone" declared under the guidelines of Hon‟ble Supreme Court of India in
> W.P. (C) No.1699/87 in the matter of "Gainda Ram Vs MCD."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 12\. On 06.02.2007, the Supreme Court in I.A. No.394 in I.A. No.356 in W.P.
> (C) No.1699/1997 while considering the scheme submitted by the MCD passed
> the following order:

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 5 of 50

> "The Scheme shall also provide that no license shall be granted to any
> person in no-hawking/squatting zones. The Station House Officer of the
> concerned police station shall take immediate steps to remove any person
> found hawking/squatting in a non-hawking/squatting area. If an allottee who
> has been allotted a tehbazari/vending site in a hawking/squatting zone, is
> found carrying on such activity in a non-hawking/squatting zone, the
> Municipal Corporation may consider cancelling his allotment."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 13\. It is submitted by learned counsel for petitioners that the Supreme
> Court in the case of Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union and another v. Municipal
> Corporation, Greater Mumbai and others, (2014) 1 SCC 490 (paragraphs 8 and
> 20) has again upheld the demarcation between vending and no-vending zones.

14\. The learned counsel for the petitioners, thus, submits that the
Pushpa/Central Market is a no-squatting/no-vending zone, but the authorities
have failed to maintain it as such. The primary grievance of the petitioners
is that even though sporadic removal actions are taken, the vendors return
almost immediately and again start squatting with the active connivance of the
officers of the MCD and the police. This led to the petitioners making a
representation to the respondents, but of no avail, the petitioners have filed
the present writ petition.

STAND OF SDMC

15\. An affidavit in the form of a status report was filed by the SDMC. As per
the status report, Pushpa Market/Central Market is a no-squatting zone and in
the said area no one can be allowed to squat/hawk. It is submitted that the
safety of the general public is of paramount W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 6 of 50
importance and if the area is not kept as a no-vending zone, the same would
severely undermine public safety.

16\. Learned counsel next contended that the concept of no-vending zone is not
alien to the Act, but that its implementation is being deferred. National
interest would prevail over private interest and the streets of Pushpa Market
have to be kept free from encroachment on road and footpath to safeguard the
lives of each citizen.

17\. Based on the record, it has been deposed that the SDMC is taking/carrying
out encroachment removal programme in respect of the temporary encroachments
in the entire area falling within the jurisdiction of Central Zone by fixing
monthly encroachment removal programmes. It is also mentioned that immediately
upon taking encroachment removal action a letter was sent to the concerned SHO
for keeping watch and to ensure that no re-encroachment takes place. In
paragraph 8 of the status report details of number of removal/encroachment
removal actions have been provided for the years 2011-15, which reads as
under:

> "8. That as per record, details of number of removal/encroachment removal

STAND OF DELHI POLICE

20\. Learned counsel for respondent nos.3 to 7 submitted that as and when
force is asked for by the SDMC, the same is provided and the area is cleared.
In 2016, SDMC conducted special drives 51 times for the removal of
encroachment from Pushpa Market and sufficient police W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page
10 of 50 assistance was provided for the same. A status report dated
13.02.2017 has also been filed wherein it is mentioned that between 01.01.2011
to 31.12.2016, the local police took legal action against 273 hawkers and
squatter who re-encroached upon the land. During the same period, the police
seized articles of total 4256 persons vide 1114 seizure memos.

21\. Accordingly, both the petitioner and the respondent SDMC are ad idem that
the area in question is a no-vending zone. During the pendency of the writ
petition, CM 2628/2015 was filed by New Association of Street Vendors of India
(hereinafter referred to as „NASVI‟). Without admitting any of the averments
made in the application, the petitioners did not oppose the impleadment, even
though a detailed reply to the application for impleadment was filed.
Accordingly, by an order dated 21.04.2016, NASVI was impleaded as respondent
no. 8 in the writ petition.

SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENT NO.8/NASVI

22\. Ms.Unninayar, learned counsel for the respondent no.8, has submitted that
the legal position has changed and Pushpa Market is no longer a no-vending
zone. The submissions of the learned counsel are as under:

22.1. She submitted that the orders/laws may be viewed in three broad time
periods since 2007:

(i) Pre-Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) dated 09.09.2013;

(ii) Post-Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra); and W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page
11 of 50

(iii) After the coming into force the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood
and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 (hereinafter the „Act‟).

22.2. In respect of the first period, learned counsel has relied upon two
judgments of the Apex Court: first being Sudhir Madan v. Municipal Corporation
of Delhi, (2009) 17 SCC 597, wherein the Scheme of the Municipal Corporation
of Delhi was accepted by the Court subject to certain modifications and the
Scheme of the NDMC. At the same time, the Supreme Court clarified that if the
legislature frames any scheme, the same shall supersede the schemes prepared
by the MCD and the NDMC (paragraph 30).

22.3. The second judgment relied upon is Gainda Ram v. MCD, (2010) 10 SCC 715
(paragraphs 48, 50, 54-56, 59-64 and 67-71) to submit that the old schemes
were in force till 30.06.2011 and not thereafter and thus, the previous
declaration of any area as a non-vending zone shall be rendered a nullity.

22.4. Since no law was forthcoming, the Apex Court in Gainda Ram v.

MCD, (2013) 11 SCC 623 (paragraphs 2, 4 and 5) observed that the law had still
not been passed and the Supreme Court continued to grapple with the problem of
regulation of street vendors. Time was sought by the Government to consult the
public and the authorities concerned, pursuant to which, the Supreme Court
directed complete status quo in respect of all engaged in hawking and street
vending as on date. The status quo was to continue until the next date of
hearing, i.e. 05.03.2013. At the same time, a direction was passed to this
Court not to entertain any petition by or against the hawkers and street
vendors till the matter is heard and decided by the Supreme Court.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 12 of 50

22.5. Ms.Unninayar submits that it was in this background, that the judgment
in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) was pronounced. It was directed to
constitute Town Vending Committees („TVC‟) in a time bound manner; which were
to function strictly in accordance with the 2009 Policy. Learned counsel
submits that the Town Vending Committee was free to divide up the city into
vending and no-vending zones, subject to the rider that no location will be
designated as „no vending‟ without full justification, i.e. the public benefit
of such designation should clearly outweigh the potential loss of livelihoods
and non-availability of affordable and convenient access of the general public
to street vendors. It is submitted that as per the Scheme, due notice was to
be served prior to clearing up or relocation. The Apex Court further directed
that all street vendors shall be registered and once registered, they shall be
entitled to operate in the area specified by the Town Vending Committee. All
existing street vendors were allowed to operate till the exercise of the
registration and creation of vending zones in terms of the 2009 Policy and
once the exercise is completed, in terms of the directions/orders of the Town
Vending Committee. These directions were to remain in force till an
appropriate legislation is brought into force. The stay upon cases before the
High Court was vacated and the High Courts were to decide the matters keeping
in view the directions. It is submitted that the Apex Court had directed in
paragraph 21.12 of Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) that the 2009 Policy
would prevail over all delegated legislation and thus, earlier schemes were no
longer good. Additionally, the declaration of no-hawking/vending zones as
contemplated in the 2009 Policy and Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers W.P. (C )
2556/2015 Page 13 of 50 Union (Supra) had not been completed as although
couple of meetings of the TVC took place, the demarcation could not take
place. Relying upon this judgment, Ms.Unninayar contends that all former
vending zone and non-vending zones as per the earlier orders were no longer in
force and the zones were to be freshly demarcated by the Town Vending
Committee.

22.6. Learned counsel submitted that once the Act came into force, the
declaration of no-vending zone was to be as per the Plan contemplated in
Section 21 to be prepared by the local authority on the recommendations of the
Town Vending Committee. Ms.Unninayar has drawn our attention to the Clause 3
(e) of the First Schedule to the Act which states that "till such time as the
survey has not been carried out and the plan for street vending has not been
formulated, no zone shall be declared as a no-vending zone." Our attention has
also been drawn to the Second Schedule, which provides for matters to be
provided in the Scheme for street vendors. More particularly, Clause (zb)
provides for the principle of relocation to be subject certain criteria,
including the avoidance of relocation in absence of a clear and urgent need
for the land in question.

22.7. Learned counsel for NASVI, has next relied upon paragraph 2 of the
judgment of a coordinate bench of this Court in National Association of Street
Vendors of India v. South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Ors., 2014 SCC
OnLine Del 4198 dated 20.08.2014 to submit that insofar street vending is
concerned, the matter is entirely covered by the Act and that S.3(3) prohibits
the eviction of any vendor until the completion of survey. Our attention is
also drawn to orders dated 10.12.2014, 15.01.2015 and 22.04.2015 of this Court
in National W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 14 of 50 Association of Street Vendors of
India (NASVI) v. South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Ors., W.P. (C)
8661/2014 where a coordinate bench directed that no street vendor shall be
evicted in terms of S. 3(3) and if any person has been evicted, they shall be
permitted to return.

22.8. Ms.Unninayar submits that the judgment in Bhola Ram Patel v. New Delhi
Municipal Corporation, 2016 (157) DRJ 584 and the subsequent clarification
judgment dated 27.09.2016 directing inter alia, two stage survey and first
stage to identify vending sites and removal of vendors to clear walkways while
giving priority to pre- existing rights, are against the provisions of the Act
and the prior judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court.

22.9. Similarly, it is submitted that the orders dated 08.08.2016 (paragraphs
14 and 16), 09.09.2016, and 05.10.2016 (paragraph 30) in Hawkers Adhikar
Suraksha Samiti v. Union of India & Ors., W.P. (C) 6130/2016 are against
judgments of the Supreme Court, provisions of the Act and the prior judgment
of this Court reported at 2014 SCC OnLine Del 4198.

22.10.It is also contended that the dismissal of the consequent SLP [SLP (C)
32023/2016] from the order dated 05.10.2016 does not affirm the interim order
in any way as in limine dismissal of SLP does not take away any alternate
rights. Reliance is placed on Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala, (2000) 6 SCC
359; Fuljit Kaur v. State of Punjab, (2010) 11 SCC 445 (paragraph 7); and
State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, (2011) 14 SCC 770 (paragraph
113). 22.11.On the factual aspect, Ms.Unninayar submitted that the street
vendors have been squatting/hawking at Pushpa Market since a long time prior
W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 15 of 50 to 30.06.2011 and the judgment in
Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) dated 09.09.2013 and thus, the
submission of the petitioners that they have started squatting under the garb
of the judgment of the Apex Court is misplaced. To this end, respondent no.8
has filed an affidavit dated 09.01.2017 annexing sample challans of street
vendors proving that they have been vending from prior to 30.06.2011.
22.12.Thus, learned counsel concludes that the present writ petition may be
dismissed with costs and the issue of declaration of the said market be left
to the local authority on the recommendation of the Town Vending Committee and
after the Survey in accordance with Sections 21, First and Second Schedules of
the Act.

CM 5125/2017 22.13.We may add that the arguments in the present writ petition
were concluded and the judgment was reserved on 01.02.2017; but thereafter,
the respondent no.8 filed fresh application bearing CM 5125/2017 for placing
certain additional documents. The documents sought to be produced were certain
tehbazari receipts issued by the respondent SDMC for "Squatters Regular 6X4"
and "7X5 Rehri Stalls/Others" at Pushpa Market. Relying upon these documents,
it has been submitted that the same belie the submission of the SDMC that the
area is a no-squatting zone.

22.14.In response to the stand taken by the SDMC, Ms.Unninayar submitted that
the SDMC is trying to dilute the definition of „street vendors‟ by creating
fictitious categories of vendors. Further the SDMC has taken divergent stands
at different times before this Court as it has fluctuated between the area
being a no-vending zone and vending zone on one hand and on the other,
contradicted itself by allowing certain squatters.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 16 of 50

REJOINDER SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS

23\. Mr.Proothi, learned counsel for the petitioners, has sought to rebut all
the contentions raised by the counsel for NASVI/respondent no.8 as under:

23.1. Learned counsel has reiterated the factual position with regard to the
declaration of Pushpa Market as a no-vending zone as mentioned in the writ
petition and reiterated in the aforegoing paragraphs. It was added that in
W.P. (C) 1699/1987, Sh.R.C. Chopra (ADJ) was appointed to look into the
question as to whether the implementation of the scheme by the erstwhile MCD
has been consistent with the norms and procedure indicated by the Supreme
Court. In its report, the Chopra Committee was of the opinion that the said
area in question i.e. Main Pushpa (Central) Market is a very congested area
and hence, squatters may not be permitted to carry on their business from this
area. It is submitted that the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions laid
down the principles on the basis of which hawkers and squatters may be granted
licences such as the National Policy, 2004 and the National Policy, 2009 and
the hawkers at the said market do not fall within the scope of any of them.
The hawkers have neither applied under any of the schemes nor have been
granted any rights by the MCD to carry on tehbazari in the area.

23.2. Our attention was also directed towards an affidavit filed in the
Supreme Court in W.P. (C) 1699/1987, pursuant to an order dated 26.07.2006,
clarifying the position of the hawkers occupying spaces in non-hawking zones
as under:

> "10. It is most respectfully submitted that the orders passed by the Hon‟ble
> High Court of Delhi in these matters ought W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 17 of 50
> to be set aside since the claimants in this case are misleading the courts
> time and again. The claimants are not eligible for squatting in
> Pushpa/Central Market. Moreover the same is a non-squatting zone. These
> claimants have no right to squat in this area."

23.3. It is next submitted that despite the numerous orders and the
resolutions, the members of the petitioner no.1 have been tackling the
nuisance created by the squatters on a daily basis and no assistance is
forthcoming from the local police.

23.4. In response to the legal submissions of Ms.Unninayar, it is submitted
that the specious argument that the hawkers are protected by the judgment of
the Apex Court in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) has been raised time
and again, but the hawkers in the Central Market area have failed to show as
to how they are covered by the judgment. Learned counsel submits that the
judgment makes it clear that firstly, no hawking shall be permitted in no-
hawking/no-vending zones; secondly, it protects the rights of all existing
hawkers and not the ones who have come forward claiming their rights as
hawkers. It is submitted that under the garb of Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union
(Supra), as many as 800 new hawkers and squatters have sprung up in the area
of Pushpa Market, making it difficult for the public to pass therein.

23.5. Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the hawkers and
vendors, who were vending in this area were pursuant to the orders of the Apex
Court and this Court, relocated and provided alternative spots to squat and
the area of Pushpa Market was directed to be kept free from any encroachment.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 18 of 50

23.6. Mr.Proothi contended that the submission of NASVI to the effect that
schemes put in place by MCD and other authorities do not hold good after
30.06.2011 is misplaced. He submits that the judgment in Maharashtra Ekta
Hawkers Union (Supra) specifically deals with the contention of the respondent
no.8.

23.7. In response to the pre-Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) era it is
submitted that the reliance on paragraphs 30 and 31 of the judgment in Sudhir
Madan (Supra) are mere submissions made by the counsel for the parties. It is
submitted that Gainda Ram [(2010) 10 SCC 715] recognizes Sections 225, 226,
330 and 369 (2) of the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 as law and as per
the provisions, a hawker can only be permitted to squat after due permission
from the commissioner, NDMC (paragraph 56). Further, paragraph 60 of the
judgment provides that the schemes shall provide for hawking and no-hawking
zones and the role and obligations of the hawkers towards society for
maintenance of law and order have been defined. It is contended that the
judgment, for the first time, placed an embargo on the operation of schemes
put in place by the MCD, NDMC and other statutory authorities till 30.06.2011
and the appropriate government was directed to enact a law on the basis of the
pending bill, so that the hawkers precisely know the contours of their rights.

23.8. Mr.Proothi next contends that the reliance upon Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers
Union (Supra) to the effect that all former vending and non- vending zones are
no longer in force and such zones are to be freshly demarcated by the Town
Vending Committee is also misplaced as:

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 19 of 50

(i) No such order was ever made by the Apex Court, on the contrary, the Apex
Court removed the embargo placed in W.P. 1699/1987 of the applicability of the
schemes only till 30.06.2011 and also directed that until the enactment of a
legislation, the guidelines of National Policy of 2009 shall be followed
(paragraph 20);

(ii) The Guidelines of the National Policy clearly show that the concept of
hawking and non-hawking zones must be applied ensuring vending in a manner
that there is no overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in public places which
is the case of the petitioners herein [paragraph 4.2 (d)];

(iii) The consequent Town Vending Committee was to while demarcating zones, in
the case of Delhi and Mumbai, consider the work already undertaken by the
municipal authorities in furtherance of the directions of the Apex Court and
the municipal authorities shall take action in terms of paragraphs 4.2(b) and
(c) [paragraph 21.6];

(iv) The 2009 Policy also provided for registration of vendors, but it is an
admitted case that the vendors do not have any licence and are not paying any
fee to the municipal corporation but, infact, have sprung up after the
judgment in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra).

23.9. Learned counsel has submitted that even after coming into force of the
Act in 2014, the hawkers cannot be permitted to squat. The protection is only
granted to „existing‟ vendors till the time the survey is conducted. Existing
vendors, as per Section 4 of the Act, are those who have a tehbazari/other
licence to vend from the authorities W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 20 of 50
concerned, which is not the case of the hawkers before this Court. Since none
of the hawkers in the Lajpat Nagar area have been granted any permission of
licence after the year 1996, the vendors/hawkers before this Court cannot be
said to be covered under the protection of Section 3. Thus, a combined reading
of sections 3 and 4 show that the street vendor is one who has a right to
squat/hawk in a particular area and such right has been given in the form of
the licence. This has also been reiterate by a coordinate bench of this Court
in Bhola Ram Patel (Supra) (LPA 136/2016) vide order dated 27.09.2016.
23.10.It is next submitted that the Act also provides for vending areas to be
demarcated as non-vending zones and thus, the concept is not alien to the Act.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the rights of vendors under Article
19 (1) (g) are subject to reasonable restrictions and if the same are not
imposed, the hawkers would hold whole cities to random, hence the argument
that till the time the Town Vending Committee conducts its surveys and
demarcates hawking and non- hawking zones, no zone is a non-hawking zone, is
bad in the eyes of law and against the larger interest of the public. Further,
the said issue has already been considered by a coordinate Bench of this
Court, which after hearing the petitioners herein, vide order dated 05.10.2016
in W.P. (C) 6130/2016 directed the continuance of the non-squatting zones
declared under the schemes prior to the enforcement of the Act as non-
squatting zones so as to balance the larger interest of the genereal public
(paragraph 28 and 29).

23.11.That the said order was challenged before the Supreme Court by an SLP
[SLP (C) 32023/2016] and the Apex Court has affirmed the order of this Court
by dismissing the SLP. Mr.Proothi submits that all the W.P. (C ) 2556/2015
Page 21 of 50 precedents and opinions of various courts go to show that the
argument of the respondent no.8 that there is no concept of hawking/non-
hawking zones is untenable and incredibly farfetched and therefore, should be
rejected by this Court. 23.12.Learned counsel relied upon Sudhir Madan (Supra)
to submit that the Supreme Court has been very strict in maintaining the areas
once cleared from encroachment as encroachment free and has time and again
held that the civic authorities must do their job of clearing the areas from
encroachments.

23.13.Alternatively, Mr.Proothi submitted that Pushpa Market has been on high
security threat list as per the intelligence agencies on numerous occasions.
Already one incident has occurred causing loss of life and property and a
second one prevented. The loss was amplified as relief could not reach the
spot due to encroachments. It is also submitted that despite specific orders
of this Court and the Supreme Court, the hawkers have disregarded such orders.

CM 5125/2017 23.14.In response to the application bearing No. CM 5125/2017
filed by the respondent no.8, Mr.Proothi submitted that the same is nothing
but an attempt to mislead this Court and prolong the present litigation. The
mala fides of NASVI are writ large by the fact that the application was filed
after extensive arguments were heard and the judgment was reserved in the
present matter. It is submitted that the persons in respect of whom these
receipts/challans have been issued are actually shopowners and not squatters.
The mentioning of the terms tehbazari/squatters/stalls is merely nomenclature
used by the SDMC when actually the holders are shopowners.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 22 of 50

RESPONSE OF SDMC

24\. Learned counsel for the SDMC has maintained the categorical stand that
the area in question is a no-vending/no-squatting zone and the area has been
cleared on numerous occasions, only to be occupied again within hours. Learned
counsel further submitted on the following lines:

24.1. It is submitted that the respondent no.8 and petitioners have failed to
understand the true import of the order dated 13.11.1996 of the Lieutenant
Governor as the same goes to protect the lives of all citizens, be it members
of the petitioner no.1 or the respondent no.8. 24.2. In response to the
documents sought to be brought on record with C.M.5125/2017, learned counsel
submitted that in Pushpa Market, there are the following types of shops:

(i) Shops occupied by the members of the petitioners;

(ii) Tehbazari sites measuring 7‟X5‟ (covered) and 6‟X4‟ occupying since the
1960s under the Gadgil Assurance Scheme, being prior to the Gainda Ram Scheme;
and

(iii) Besides these, the others are unauthorised encroachers which have been
removed by the corporation from time to time. 24.3. Additionally, there are 49
covered tehbazari sites measuring 6‟X13‟ allotted to shop owners. The SDMC has
never removed this category of shop owners and have been occupying permanent
shops/sites under allotment. Our attention was also diverted to an affidavit
filed before the Supreme Court in W.P. (C) 1699/1987, the relevant portion of
which reads as under:

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 23 of 50

> "5. The gist of the relevant orders of this Hon‟ble Court in relation to the
> above categories of tehbazaris were as follows  Order dated 01.05.1997 This
> Hon‟ble Court held that squatters found eligible under the R.C.Chopra
> Committee shall be rehabilitated in notified squatting zone to be decided by
> the authorities.

>  Order dated 01.12.2000 This Hon‟ble Court noticed the policy decision
> taken by the Government of the NCT of Delhi based on the Lt.Governor‟s
> earlier decision dated 13.12.1996 where it was decided that no Tehbazari was
> to be allowed in sites close to the Bomb Blast site including Blocks D & J.
> Thus the entire area was to be treated as a non- squatting area and all
> those who are occupying those areas will be removed and provided alternate
> site for squatting in accordance to their seniority elsewhere.  Order dated
> 10.05.2001 This Hon‟ble Court has held that the old 6‟X4‟ tehbazaaries would

> 6\. The applicants in I.A.No.394 are eligible squatters under the Gainda Ram

> 7\. The applicants in I.A.No.356 are old 6‟X4‟ tehbazari holders in Central
> Market D & J Blocks, Lajpat Nagar and were allotted Tehbazari during the
> period 1962-1968 pursuant to Gadgil Assurance Scheme.

> 8\. As far as 7‟X5‟ category is concerned, these are covered tehbazari

> Assurance Scheme."

> (Emphasis Supplied) W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 24 of 50 24.4. It was clarified
> that the occupants of shops, described as „covered tehbazari‟, which are
> allotted on plots with specific shop numbers in Pushpa/Central Market are
> neither on pavements/roads nor encroaching on any public area. There are 53
> tehbazari sites measuring 7‟X5‟ (covered) and 71 tehbazari sites measuring

> holders whose khokhas were in existence prior to 31.12.1965.

Sites measuring 6‟X4‟ were also allotted during the same years i.e. much prior
to the Gainda Ram Scheme in 1992.

24.5. Learned counsel next submitted that after the Gainda Ram Scheme came
into existence in the year 1992 and under the guidelines/directions of the
Supreme Court, cases of the vendors in the area of Central Zone were
considered and the vendors whose cases were approved by the Chopra Committee
were shifted and allocated sites at approved squatting sites. All other
vendors, whose cases were not approved, were removed from the Central Market
Area. 24.6. Since the squatters were dispossessed and the area was declared a
no-

> squatting zone, the squatters filed applications/petitions before the
> Supreme Court with the plea that there exist 53 tehbazaris of 7‟X5‟ and 71
> of 6‟X4‟ prior to the Gainda Ram Scheme. This led to the passing of the
> order dated 01.12.2000 in W.P. (C) 1699/1987 as mentioned in paragraph 8
> aforegoing.

24.7. Pursuant thereto, the erstwhile MCD issued notices to both the
tehbazaris to vacate the sites in the year 2001. The notices were W.P. (C )
2556/2015 Page 25 of 50 challenged by permanent tehbazari holders of 7‟X5‟
alleging that they are not tehbazari holders, but are shopkeepers having
allotment of land measuring size 7‟X5‟ with the permission to construct shops
thereupon on their own expense. It is submitted that this stand was accepted
by the MCD.

24.8. Subsequently, final notices were issued to the tehbazari holder of size
6‟X4‟ to vacate the sites within the stipulated period. The said tehbazari
holders again moved the Supreme Court in I.A. 356 in W.P. (C) 1699/1987. The
MCD filed an affidavit stating that they were 6‟X4‟ open tehbazari holders.
Thereafter, the Supreme Court passed the following order dated 10.05.2001:

> "I.A.No.356: The sole dispute in this interlocutory application is whether
> applicants mentioned herein, who are admittedly not the hawker on the
> pavement, but were shop owner abutting the pavement (covered Tehbazari) are
> not covered by the judgment of this Court in Gainda Ram. In view of the
> affidavit filed on behalf of the MCD, which is reiterated by the learned
> counsel appearing for the MCD, and in view of the statement that earlier
> notice was issued on account of certain confusion, we dispose of the matter
> by holding that these persons are not covered by the judgment of this Court
> in Gainda Ram."

> (Emphasis Supplied) 24.9. Learned counsel concluded that it is clear from
> the aforegoing that the tehbazari holders who were allotted sites between
> 1962-68 were allowed to operate from Central/Pushpa Market being old
> squatters prior to the Gainda Ram Scheme. These persons, being allotted
> permanent places and are not encroaching upon road or pavement, thus, were
> not covered by the order dated 13.11.1996 of the Lieutenant Governor. It is
> submitted that the removal of these authorized W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 26
> of 50 tehbazari holders would tantamount to removal of private shops from
> the area.

24.10.It was submitted that the members of the respondent no.8, who are
encroachers on public land and have not been authorized by the SDMC on any
account and cannot equate themselves at par with the authorised tehbazari
holders allotted under the Gadgil Assurance Scheme. Hence, reliance upon the
tehbazari receipts issued to such persons is misplaced.

25\. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and considered their
rival contentions. Since the submissions of the learned counsel are quite
verbose owing to the abuse of filing of „brief‟ written submissions/legal
points, we deem it appropriate to summarize the contentions of the parties.

26\. The submissions of Mr.Proothi, learned counsel for the petitioner, can be
summed up as under:

(i) Pursuant to a bomb blast on 21.05.1996 leading to loss of 13 persons
coupled with monetary loss of crores of rupees, a high level enquiry was
ordered by the then Lieutenant Governor and as per its recommendations, the
Lieutenant Governor had by order dated 13.11.1996 directed the authorities to
clear all the roads, lanes and by-lanes in Pushpa Market and further declared
the area to be a no squatting zone;

(ii) Thereafter, it has been the consistent stand of the erstwhile MCD and
SDMC that the area is a no squatting zone before the various judicial forums;

(iii) The reliance placed by the respondent no.8 on Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers
Union (Supra) is misplaced inasmuch as it has W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 27 of
50 been unable to show as to how the street vendors are covered by the
judgment particularly when the judgment makes it clear that no hawking shall
be permitted in no-hawking/no-vending zones and as the judgment does not cover
vendors who have propped up after the judgment;

(iv) The submission of Ms.Unninayar that the schemes of the municipal
authority do not hold good after 30.06.2011 or after Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers
Union (Supra) is misplaced;

(v) Protection under Section 3 (3) of the Act is only to „existing‟ street
vendors, i.e. those holding tehbazari/other licence to vend from the
authorities concerned;

(vi) The issue of no-vending zones has already been considered by a coordinate
Bench of this Court in W.P. (C) 6130/2016 and it has been directed by order
dated 05.10.2016 that the non-squatting zones declared under the schemes prior
to the enforcement of the Act shall continue as non-squatting zones so as to
balance the larger interest of the general public;

(vii) The order dated 05.10.2016 in W.P. (C) 6130/2016 has already been
challenged before the Supreme Court by a petition seeking special leave to no
avail and thus, has attained finality; and

(viii) The persons whose receipts are sought to be relied upon in CM 5125/2017
are not street vendors, but infact shopowners and that mentioning of terms
like tehbazari/squatters/stalls on the receipts is merely a nomenclature
adopted by the MCD;

27\. The submissions of the learned counsel for the respondent no.8/NASVI can
be summarized as under:

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 28 of 50

(i) In light of Sudhir Madan (Supra), Gainda Ram (Supra) and Maharashtra Ekta
Hawkers Union (Supra), there was no existing scheme declaring any zone let
alone, Pushpa Market/Central Market Lajpat Nagar, as a no-hawking/vending zone
at the time that the Act came into force;

(ii) The judgments of the Supreme Court including Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers
Union (Supra) and the Act enacted in 2014 would prevail over any executive
decision passed in 1996 or Supreme Court order passed in 2000 or even any
further orders passed from time to time;

(iii) As per the new Act, the determination of vending and no-

> vending zones is to be done as per the plan contemplated in Section 21 once
> the survey is carried out, which is yet to be done;

(iv) The First Schedule of the Act categorically provides under clause 3 (e)
that, till such time as the survey has not been carried out and the plan for
street vending has not been formulated, no zone shall be declared as a no-
vending zone;

(v) The members of the respondent no.8 association have been squatting at
Pushpa Market since a long time as evidenced from the challans placed on
record and thus, the submission that they have sprung up under the garb of
Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) is misplaced; and

(vi) The SDMC have taken contradictory and inconsistent stands as on one hand
they have permitted certain squatters and at the same time excluded others,
thereby creating fictitious categories of vendors.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 29 of 50

28\. The categorical stand of the SDMC/respondent no.1 and 2 remains that the
area in question is a no-vending/no-squatting zone and the area has been
cleared on numerous occasions, only to be re- encroached upon immediately. The
persons whose receipts are sought to be brought on record by CM 5125/2017 are
of 7‟X5‟ (covered) and 6‟X4‟ tehbazari holders, who were allotted under the
Gadgil Assurance Scheme during the period 1962-1968, much prior to the Gainda
Ram Scheme. These persons, having been allotted permanent places and not
encroaching upon the road or pavement and are not covered by the order dated
13.11.1996.

29\. We proceed to analyse the rival contentions of the parties. This is a
classic case where having learnt our lesson, we still refuse to adhere to the
same. A bomb blast took place in the area of Pushpa/Central Market on
21.05.1996 causing loss to both human life and property. The damage was
augmented by the failure of emergency services to arrive at the site owing to
congestion in the roads and lanes of the market. This led to the order dated
13.11.1996 of the Lieutenant Governor directing the authorities to clear all
the roads, lanes and by- lanes in Central/Pushpa Market.

30\. At the time, the Apex Court was dealing with the problem of influx of
population to urban centres and proliferation of street vendors in W.P. (C)
1699/1987. Numerous petitions and applications were being filed before the
Supreme Court, but the erstwhile MCD maintained that the area was a no-
squatting/no-vending zone.

31\. Despite the bomb blast, order of the Lieutenant Governor dated 13.11.1996
and various orders of the Supreme Court from time to time, respondent
no.8/NASVI has sought to allege that owing to W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 30 of
50 Sudhir Madan (Supra), Gainda Ram (Supra) and Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union
(Supra), followed by the new Act solely empowering the Town Vending Committee
to declare any area as a no-vending zone, no area can be said to be a no-
vending zone.

32\. The said contention and the life of the schemes formulated prior to the
Act was considered by a coordinate bench of this Court in Hawkers Adhikar
Suraksha Samiti v. Union of India and Ors., W.P. (C) 6130/2016, which vide
order dated 05.10.2016 directed that as an interim measure, the schemes
existing prior to the enforcement of the Act shall continue to be non-
squatting zones for the time being. The relevant portion of the order reads as
under:

> "4. ...It was alleged in the said writ petition that the Respondents were
> carrying out eviction drives and have been illegally removing the street
> vendors across the National Capital in complete violation of the mandatory
> provisions of the Act and the directions of the Supreme Court dated
> 09.09.2013 in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union & Anr. v. Municipal
> Corporation, Greater Mumbai & Ors.; (2014) 1 SCC 490. It was contended that
> since no scheme has been in operation by virtue of the interim order dated
> 08.08.2016, the Respondents are not entitled to proceed with the so-called
> survey and resort to illegal and highhanded eviction of the existing
> hawkers/ street vendors. ...

> 9\. On behalf of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), a short affidavit
> dated 24.09.2016 has been filed stating that Pushpa Market/Central Market,
> Lajpat Nagar is a non-squatting zone and therefore encroachment removal
> actions were being carried out regularly as per the provisions of the Delhi
> Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (for short 'DMC Act'). It is alleged that
> after the interim order dated 09.09.2016 was passed by this Court not to
> evict the street vendors without following due process of law, the street
> vendors occupied the non-squatting zones also at the instance of the writ
> petitioner and the officials W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 31 of 50 are unable to
> take any steps for removal of the said encroachments in the light of the
> order dated 09.09.2016.

> 10\. On the basis of the said short affidavit, it is vehemently contended by

> ...

> 27\. So far as the submission of Sh.Neeraj Kishan Kaul, the learned ASG

> the 134 wards of MCD and that the said Committees were charged with the
> duties of identifying the sites, declaring hawking and non-hawking zones in
> consultation with various stakeholders like Associations of Vendors/Traders,
> Resident Welfare Associations, Traffic Police, etc.

> 28\. It is relevant to note that the Act of 2014 also provides for

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 32 of 50

> 29\. Having regard to the fact that declaration of non- squatting zones and
> non-vending areas is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of 2014
> which expressly prohibits carrying out vending activities by street vendors

> 30\. We therefore direct as an interim measure that :

> (i) the order dated 09.09.2016 in W.P.(C) No.8042/2016 shall not be made
> applicable to the areas identified as non-squatting zones under the schemes

> 33\. From the aforegoing, it is clear that the contention that the old

Further, the respondent no.8 herein/NASVI was represented through their
counsel before the Bench when the order were passed. The order was challenged
before the Apex Court in Ajay Maken v. Commissioner of Police and Ors., SLP
(C) 32023/2016, which was dismissed in limine. Despite the same, Ms.Unninayar
has effectively sought to re-argue the matter. We may note that the dismissal
of an SLP in limine does not lead to merger of the order of the inferior court
and thus, the original order remains intact and other remedies, including
review, remain open. At the same time, challenging the order in separate
proceedings is not an alternate remedy which can be availed. We remain bound
by the order of the coordinate bench.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 33 of 50

34\. Even otherwise, we are unable to accept the submissions of the learned
counsel for the respondent no.8 as the judgments of the Supreme Court sought
to be relied upon do not lead to the conclusion that all the old schemes were
put to naught and vendors were given a free hand to vend at any place of their
choice. Such an interpretation would lead to an incongruous situation where on
one hand the implementation of the Act qua conducting of survey and
certification of vendors remains in limbo, while on the other hand activities
of vendors continue in an unregulated manner.

35\. There is no quarrel with the proposition that the schemes framed by the
municipal authorities and approved by the Courts would be subject to any
scheme/regulation/act framed by the legislature [Sudhir Madan (Supra)
(paragraph 30)]; but the same would be limited to the
repugnancy/inconsistency.

36\. The Supreme Court in W.P. (C) 1699/1987 was dealing with the regulation
of street vending activities in Delhi. By a detailed judgment dated 09.10.2010
[(2010) 10 SCC 715], the Division Bench of the Supreme Court observed that the
right to hawk on the streets of Delhi having been recognised as a fundamental
right under Article 19 (1) (g) and subject to reasonable restrictions under
Artic le 19 (6) [Sodan Singh v. New Delhi Municipal Committee, (1989) 4 SCC
155]. Such restrictions could only be imposed by „law‟ and not by the schemes
and policies framed by the MCD and the NDMC. Thus, the Apex Court disposed of
the writ petition with the d irection that the problem of hawking and street
vending could be regulated by the schemes until 30.06.2011 and before such
date, the appropriate Government was to enact a law based upon the Model
Street Vendors W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 34 of 50 (Protection of Livelihood and
Regulation of Street Vending) Bill, 2009\. The relevant paragraphs of the
judgment dated 09.10.2010 are reproduced as under:

> "45. It has been held by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Sodan Singh
> [(1989) 4 SCC 155] that right to hawk on the streets of Delhi is a
> fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution but such right
> is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article
> 19(6) of the Constitution.

> 46\. On a perusal of the aforesaid constitutional provision, it is clear
> that the rights under Article 19(1)(g) can only be controlled by law as
> contemplated in Article 19(6). ...

> 47\. On an analysis of the provisions under Article 19(6), it is clear that
> the provisions under Article 19(6) are broadly in two parts. The first part
> authorises that nothing in sub- clause (g) of Article 19(1) shall affect the
> operation of existing law insofar as it imposes reasonable restrictions, in
> the interest of general public, on rights conferred by Article 19(1)(g). The
> second part is that nothing contained in Article 19(1)(g) shall prevent the
> State from making any law imposing, in the interest of general public,
> reasonable restrictions on the exercise of rights conferred by Article
> 19(1)(g). Here we are not concerned with clauses (i) and

> (ii) of Article 19(6).

> 48\. It is, therefore, clear that reasonable restrictions on the fundamental
> right under Article 19(1)(g) can be imposed either by existing law or by a
> law which may be made by a State in the interest of general public.
> Therefore, nothing short of law can impose reasonable restrictions on a
> citizen's fundamental right to carry on hawking under Article 19(1)(g) of
> the Constitution.

> ...

> 61\. Subsequent to the 2004 Policy a new National Policy on Urban Street
> Vendors, 2009 (hereinafter "the 2009 Policy") was framed on 17-6-2009. The
> most important part of the 2009 Policy is that it recognises street vending
> as an integral and legitimate part of urban retail trade and distribution
> system, even when otherwise street vending is sometimes projected as a major
> menace in urban areas W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 35 of 50 aggravating traffic
> problems. But the 2009 Policy aims at giving the street vendors a legal
> status by providing them legitimate vending and hawking zones in the city in
> the town master plans and development plans.

> 62\. The National Policy, therefore, directs "Municipal authorities should
> frame necessary rules for regulating entry of street vendors on a time-
> sharing basis in designated vending zones keeping in view three broad
> categories -- registered vendors who have secured a licence for a specified
> site/stall; registered street vendors in a zone on a time-sharing basis; and
> registered mobile street vendors visiting one or the other vending zone;".
> ...

> 67\. In the background of the provisions in the Bill and the 2009 Policy, it
> is clear that an attempt is made to regulate the fundamental right of street
> hawking and street vending by law, since it has been declared by this Court
> that the right to hawk on the streets or right to carry on street vending is
> part of fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). However, till the law is
> made the attempt made by NDMC and MCD to regulate this right by framing
> schemes which are not statutory in nature is not exactly within the
> contemplation of constitutional provisions discussed above. However, such
> schemes have been regulated from time to time by this Court for several
> years as pointed out above. Even, orders passed by this Court, in trying to
> regulate such hawking and street vending, is not law either. At the same
> time, there is no denying the fact that hawking and street vending should be
> regulated by law. Such a law is imminently necessary in public interest.

> 68\. Certain broad facts cannot be lost sight of. Whatever power this Court

> 2556/2015 Page 36 of 50 number of cars, scooters and three wheelers. No
> restriction has apparently been imposed by any law on such purchase of cars,
> three wheelers, scooters and cycles. There is very little scope for

> 69\. This Court finds that innumerable IAs have been filed in this Court

> 70\. This Court, therefore, disposes of this writ petition and all the IAs

> 78\. However, before 30-6-2011, the appropriate Government is to enact a law

> 37\. It is clear that the Apex Court was of the view that neither the

At the same time, the Supreme Court allowed the regulation of the street
vending till 30.06.2011 by the present schemes in the forlorn hope that an
appropriate legislation shall be enacted by then.

38\. The appropriate Government had failed to comply with the direction of the
Apex Court in paragraphs 70 and 78 inasmuch as it failed to bring in
legislation by 30.06.2011. This led to the Apex Court to W.P. (C ) 2556/2015
Page 38 of 50 direct maintenance of status quo on 15.07.2011. The order reads
as under:

> " Heard learned counsel for the applicants and perused the record.

> Since judgment of this Court has so far not been implemented, inasmuch as
> appropriate legislation has not been enacted by the competent legislature,
> we direct the parties to maintain the status quo as it is obtaining today."

39\. On 02.02.2012, the previous order was slightly modified and the NDMC was
directed not to "remove any encroachment other than those which are on
footpath or road." The Supreme Court on 01.05.2012 vacated the order dated
15.07.2011 and directed the NDMC to make allotment of identified spaces and
identify sites in accordance with the 2006 scheme. Therefore, it had become
clear that the Supreme Court had once again attempted to regulate street
vending as per the old regime having given up hope of timely enactment of a
law. Thus, it cannot be said that the old regime of schemes and policies can
no longer regulate the activities of street vendors.

40\. Later on 31.03.2013 [(2013) 11 SCC 623], the Apex Court observed that the
appropriate legislation had not been enacted and the Court was once again
grappling with numerous applications and petitions. Since the Government of
NCT of Delhi had sought time to consult the public and other authorities, the
Court directed a complete status quo in respect of all persons engaged in
hawking and street vending in entire area of Delhi. The interim order was
continued on 05.03.2013 and 29.04.2013. On the latter date, it was contended
by the counsel for few applicants before the Supreme Court that since the
legislation has been unduly delayed, the Court may direct implementation of
the W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 39 of 50 National Policy for Urban Street
Vendors, 2009. The matter was ultimately disposed of in terms of the order
dated 09.09.2013 in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra) and the directions
contained therein were to read as a part of the same.

41\. When the Apex Court was hearing Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra),
it was submitted by a counsel representing the street vendors/hawkers that
until the enactment of a legislation, the Supreme Court may ordain the
implementation of the 2009 Policy. This found favour with the Court, which
directed the implementation of the 2009 Policy. The Policy provides for
principled demarcation of „Restriction-free Vending Zones‟, „Restricted
Vending Zones‟ and „No-vending Zones‟ (Para 4.2) by the Town Vending Committee
(Para 4.5.1). No area was to be notified as a „No-vending Zone‟ without full
justification wherein public benefit overweighed the loss of livelihood and
access of general public to street vendors [Para 4.2 d)]. For the purpose of
demarcation, the Town Vending Committee was to work out a non-discretionary
system [Para 4.5.2 (e)]. The Apex Court had further issued directions in order
to facilitate the implementation of the 2009 Policy in a time-bound manner. We
deem it appropriate to extract the relevant directions hereunder:

> "21. For facilitating implementation of the 2009 Policy, we issue the
> following directions:

> 21.1. Within one month from the date of receipt of copy of this order, the
> Chief Secretaries of the State Governments and Administrators of the Union
> Territories shall issue necessary instructions/directions to the
> department(s) concerned to ensure that the Town Vending Committee is
> constituted at city/town level in accordance with the provisions contained
> in the 2009 Policy. For the cities and W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 40 of 50
> towns having large municipal areas, more than one Town Vending Committee may
> be constituted.

> ...

> 21.4. The task of constituting the Town Vending Committees shall be
> completed within two months of the issue of instructions by the Chief
> Secretaries of the State and the Administrators of the Union Territories.
> ...

> 21.6. The Town Vending Committees shall be free to divide the municipal
> areas in vending/hawking zones and sub- zones and for this purpose they may
> take assistance of experts in the field. While undertaking this exercise,
> the Town Vending Committees constituted for the cities of Delhi and Mumbai
> shall take into consideration the work already undertaken by the municipal
> authorities in furtherance of the directions given by this Court. The
> municipal authorities shall also take action in terms of Paras 4.2(b) and
> (c). 21.7. All street vendors/hawkers shall be registered in accordance with
> Para 4.5.4 of the 2009 Policy. Once registered, the street vendor/hawker,
> shall be entitled to operate in the area specified by the Town Vending

> 21.8. The process of registration must be completed by the municipal

> 21.12. The State Governments, the Administration of the Union Territories

> 21.15. All the existing street vendors/hawkers operating across the country

> 21.16. The provisions of the 2009 Policy and the directions contained
> hereinabove shall apply to all the municipal areas in the country.

> 21.17. The aforesaid directions shall remain operative till an appropriate

> is brought into force."

> (Emphasis Supplied)

> 42\. The judgment of the Apex Court signalled two aspects: first, the
> Supreme Court had refused to wait for an appropriate legislation and
> directed the regulation of street vending as per the 2009 Policy and second,
> the street vendors/hawkers were granted protection until registration. Such
> process was to be completed within four months from the receipt of
> directions of Chief Secretaries; which were inturn to be issued within one
> month of the receipt of the judgment. Thus, the process of registration was

> the order of the Supreme Court. At the same time, the Supreme Court directed
> that the Town Vending Committee was to undertake the exercise of demarcation
> having regard to the work already undertaken by the municipal authorities in
> furtherance to the directions issued by the Supreme Court.

43\. From the aforegoing, it is clear that the Town Vending Committee was to
take into consideration the old schemes of the municipal authorities in Delhi
and Mumbai. This again goes to show that the old schemes were not dead as the
same were once again relied to regulate the activities of vendors. The vendors
were only granted interim protection until registration and demarcation of
vending/hawking W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 42 of 50 zones, which was to be
concluded in a time bound manner. These directions were issued by the Supreme
Court in the anticipation that the problem relating to street vending and the
conflicting interests of various stakeholders could now be regulated by the
2009 Policy and the consequent Town Vending Committee.

44\. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the submission of Ms.Unninayar
that the judgments in Gainda Ram [(2010) 10 SCC 715] and Maharashtra Ekta
Hawkers Union (Supra) erased the previous classification of non-vending zones
into a nullity and gave a clan chit to the street vendors to hawk/squat at any
place found fit by them in disregard of the rights of the other stakeholders.

45\. Even thereafter, before the 2009 Policy could regulate street vending as
directed in Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union (Supra), the 2014 Act came into
force on 01.05.2014.

46\. Under the new Act, the Government of NCT of Delhi framed Rules and Scheme
for the implementation of the Act. The Rules and the Scheme have been
challenged before this Court and are hanging fire. A coordinate bench of this
Court in Janodaya Ekta Samiti (Regd.) v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Ors., W.P.
(C) 6622/2015 and connected matters vide order dated 08.08.2016 stayed the
enforcement of the Scheme and thus, the constitution of the Town Vending
Committee is deferred. It was in this background that the order dated
05.10.2016 was passed in Hawkers Adhikar Suraksha Samiti (Supra) as mentioned
in paragraph 32 aforegoing.

47\. As per the Act, the declaration of no-vending zone is to be carried out
by the Plan for Street Vending to be prepared by the local authority in
consultation with the Town Vending Committee [Section 21 read with W.P. (C )
2556/2015 Page 43 of 50 the First Schedule]. At the same time, Clause 3(e) of
the First Schedule provides that till the completion of survey and formulation
of the plan, no zone shall be declared as a no-vending zone. This clause
merely prohibits any further declaration of no-vending zones and does not
nullify the existing demarcation by the municipal authorities. On the
contrary, it tacitly recognises that certain areas might have already been
declared as no-vending zones.

48\. Accordingly, we also subscribe to the view taken by the coordinate bench
of this Court Hawkers Adhikar Suraksha Samiti (Supra) in its order dated
05.10.2016 that as an interim measure, the non-squatting zones declared under
the old schemes shall continue to be non- squatting zones for the time being.
Hence, the protection of Section 3 (3) shall not extend to vendors in no-
vending zones.

49\. The other judgments sought to be relied upon by the learned counsel for
the respondent no.8 also do not come to its aid. The reliance on National
Association of Street Vendors of India (Supra) is misplaced as the said
judgment deals with the applicability of the provisions of Food Safety and
Standards Act, 2006 vis-à-vis the provisions in the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 impinging on food safety and health concerns. Further,
the judgment or orders dated 10.12.2014, 15.01.2015 and 22.04.2015 in W.P. (C)
8661/2014 cannot be read to lay any precedent in respect of no-vending zones.

50\. Learned counsel for respondent no.8/NASVI had also drawn the attention of
this Court to certain receipts issued by the respondent no.1/SDMC for
"Squatters Regular 6X4" and "7X5 Rehri Stalls/Others" alleging that the same
belied the stand of the petitioner and the SDMC of Pushpa/Central Market being
a no-vending zone and W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 44 of 50 further accusing SDMC
of discriminating between similarly placed squatters. The stand of the SDMC is
that these persons were allotted sites during the period 1962-1968 pursuant to
the Gadgil Assurance Scheme and occupy permanent sites neither upon the road
or the pavement.

51\. To appreciate this submission, we deem it necessary to trace the
background to the order dated 01.12.2000. The Supreme Court in 1994 while
dealing with the problem of hawking in Delhi in W.P. (C) 1699/1987 had
directed the appointment of a judicial officer to look into the question as to
whether the implementation of the Scheme by the MCD had been consistent with
the norms and procedure indicated by this Court and to make a report.
Accordingly, this Court had nominated Mr.R.C. Chopra, Additional District and
Sessions Judge to examine the erstwhile scheme and make his report. The Chopra
Committee submitted its report on 20.12.1996, about a month after the
declaration of Pushpa/Central Market as a no-vending zone. The Report was
considered and accepted by the Apex Court in W.P. (C) 1699/1987 on 01.05.1997
[(1998) 1 SCC 188] while issuing certain directions. It was directed that
after the completion of the process of identification of eligible squatters
and allotment of sites, the zonal heads of the MCD and SHOs of the areas shall
be made personally liable for ensuring that there is no squatting in non-
squatting zones.

52\. It was in this background that the order dated 01.12.2000 was passed.

Pursuant to the directions, the approved street vendors were shifted while
others were removed. Both the 7‟X5‟ and the 6‟X4‟ tehbazari holders under the
Gadgil Assurance Scheme were issued eviction notices. Since the 7‟X5‟
tehbazari holders are entitled to construct W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 45 of 50
covers and are effectively proper shops, they were no longer treated as street
vendors. This remains the consistent stand of the SDMC even today.

53\. There seems to be slightly less clarity as to the status of the 6‟X4‟
tehbazari holders. These persons were too allotted sites under the Gadgil
Assurance Scheme and were issued eviction notices pursuant to the order dated
01.12.2000. The said tehbazari holders had approached the Apex Court by filing
I.A. 356 in W.P. (C) 1699/1987, which was disposed of by the Court holding
that the persons are not covered by the judgment in W.P. (C) 1699/1987.

54\. Thus, this category of tehbazari holders were held to be distinct and
apart from other street vendors which were to be removed/relocated as per the
order dated 13.11.1996 of the Lieutenant Governor and order dated 01.12.2000
of the Supreme Court in W.P. (C) 1699/1987. Accordingly, the squatters
represented by respondent no.8 cannot claim parity with either the tehbazari
holders of 7‟X5‟, being infact shop owners nor the holders of 6‟X4‟ which have
been held by the Apex Court to be excluded from the order dated 01.12.2000.

55\. Further, in order to ensure that these tehbazari holders are not blocking
the roads, lanes or by-lanes, we had directed the SDMC to place a site plan on
record. The SDMC has placed the site plan on record marking the location of
tehbazari holders and that of the unauthorized vendors, which is reproduced
hereunder:

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 46 of 50

Note: Area marked in red is blocked by the unauthorised street vendors.

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 47 of 50

56\. From the site plan, it is clear that these tehbazari holders are not
blocking the roads, lanes, by-lanes or pavements; on the contrary, the roads,
lanes, by-lanes and pavements are being blocked by the unauthorised street
vendors despite the area being declared as non- hawking/non-vending zone. The
effect of this is fatal and suicidal as in case of a calamity, no vehicles of
emergency services, including ambulances or fire trucks, can reach the spot
and relief would be hampered on account of obstruction on the roads and by-
lanes. The order dated 13.11.1996 was passed in the background of a horrific
bomb blast which had resulted in the loss of several lives. The emergency
services could not reach owing to blockages and encroachments on the
passageways. With the passage of time, the situation has only worsened with
the unabated influx of people and street vendors. Numerous persons visit the
market on a daily basis and this Court would be putting all of their lives and
security in jeopardy if we were to be a privy to the encroachers. Being
pitched between the conflicting rights of the livelihood of the street vendors
versus the life and security of the public in general, including the street
vendors. We are of the opinion that the former must bow to the latter as
without life and security, no question of earning a livelihood can arise.

57\. Additionally, we are informed by the counsel for the police and SDMC that
the area shown in red in the aforegoing map is blocked by the unauthorised
street vendors, but the conditions at the site are much worse as the balance
open areas are used by pedestrians, movement of traffic and customers who no
longer have access to the pavements. To this effect various photographs were
shown in Court.

58\. Accordingly, we conclude that in view of the order dated 05.10.2016 in
Hawkers Adhikar Suraksha Samiti v. Union of India and Ors., W.P. (C) 6130/2016
and reasons recorded in the aforegoing paragraphs, Pushpa/Central Market
continues to remain a no-squatting zone. Needless to say that the same may be
re-considered by the Town Vending Committee once the same comes into
operation.

59\. Though the issue was covered in W.P.(C) 6130/2016, where respondent
no.8/NASVI was a party represented by the same counsel, Ms.Unninayar had
insisted that she be heard again and despite the opposition of Mr.Proothi, a
prolonged hearing was granted, matter was adjourned as and when requested by
Ms.Unninayar either on personal grounds or that of her client being
unavailable only to avoid any grievance that the street vendors were not
heard.

60\. We allow the present writ petition with the following directions:

> (i) The SDMC and the Delhi Police are directed to ensure that Pushpa/Central
> Market, i.e. the area covered by the order dated 13.11.1996 of the
> Lieutenant Governor is maintained as a no- squatting zone;

> (ii) Once the area has been cleared, it shall be ensured that the vendors
> are not allowed to return or squat again;

> (iii) The SDMC shall conduct regular eviction drives;

> (iv) Delhi Police is to render all the necessary assistance in eviction of
> vendors to the SDMC;

> (v) The zonal head of SDMC and the concerned SHO shall be personally liable
> to ensure that direction (ii) is not flouted;

W.P. (C ) 2556/2015 Page 49 of 50

> (vi) Both the SDMC and the Delhi Police are to prepare and maintain lists of
> persons removed from the area to ensure that repeat offenders are brought to
> the book;

> (vii) On receipt of the order, a meeting shall be convened of all the
> concerned authorities to discuss the implementation of the order and
> measures proposed to maintain the area as a non- hawking/non-squatting zone;
> and

> (viii) Any person aggrieved by unlawful vending in the area is at liberty to
> approach the SDMC or the SHO at the first instance and then this Court.

61\. The directions shall continue until the Town Vending Committee comes into
operation and finally decides whether the area is to be a vending zone or no-
vending zone.

62\. The writ petition is disposed of.

C.M. 33202/2016

63\. This is an application filed by the respondent no.8/NASVI seeking interim
protection of the vendors during the pendency of the present petition. In view
of the order passed in the writ petition, no further orders are required to be
passed.

64\. The application is disposed of.
