    Shri Anand Sharma, counsel for petitioner
    ####
    
    By the Court:-

This petition is filed against demand of Rs.1,38,704/- which, according to
respondent Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, is outstanding to petitioner in
electricity bills. The bill pertained to the year 1983.

Contention of learned counsel for petitioner is that demand has been raised
without any notice. Respondents have no authority to attach petitioner's
property under Section 229 of the Land Revenue Act, 1956.

Billing dispute cannot be directly agitated entertained in extraordinary scope
of writ jurisdiction. Petitioner, however, may make a representation to
respondent no.2 - the Recovery Officer-cum-Executive Engineer (O&M), Jaipur
Discom, Tonk, who shall consider the same and pass speaking order within four
weeks thereon from the date it is made. If petitioner is still aggrieved by
decision on his representation, he may approach the District Consumer
Protection Forum or file civil suit as may be advised to him.

Writ petition is accordingly disposed of. This also disposes of stay
application.
