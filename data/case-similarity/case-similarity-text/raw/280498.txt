In this batch of writ petitions preferred under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, the constitutional validity of Section 65(105)(zzzz) of
the Finance Act, 1995 (for short „the 1995 Act‟) and Section 66 as amended by
the Finance Act, 2010 (for brevity „the 2010 Act‟) is called in question. The
matters were initially placed before a Division Bench wherein the learned
counsel for the parties raised many a submission and regard being had to the
nature of the cases, the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 13 of
100 Division Bench thought it appropriate that the controversy should be
dwelled upon by a larger Bench. Thereafter, the matters have been placed
before us.

2 For the sake of clarity and convenience, we shall advert to the facts
adumbrated in W.P.(C) No.3398/2010 and deal with the contentions canvassed by
the learned counsel for the parties in all the writ petitions as the issue is
common to all. The petitioner, a registered company under the Companies Act,
1956, has taken commercial property / shops on rent for carrying on its retail
business. It takes immovable property by way of lease or licence and once the
lease deed or the deed of licence is entered with the owner, there is no
continuous flow of transaction between them. The tenant is entitled to use the
premises for a fixed tenure under the agreement and the transaction with the
owner is a onetime transaction. The transactions are principal to principal
and there is no value addition by providing the premises on lease / licence by
the owner of the property. The petitioner, as pleaded, is a substantial
contributor to the sustained growth and development of the national economy
and has contributed huge amounts to the revenue by payment of taxes, charges
and cess under diverse heads and the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters
Page 14 of 100 premises occupied by it establishing commercial establishments
like shops are meant for diverse situations and, accordingly, arrangements
have been made. The consideration paid by the petitioner under the lease deed
or agreement of licence is purely a consideration for acquiring the occasional
and possessory rights of these premises and utilizing the same. The premises
that have been taken by the petitioner have been referred to in the petition
and it is urged that in the case of the agreements that have been entered with
the respective owners, the liability rests with the owners to pay the service
tax but the owners insist upon the petitioner to make payment of the service
tax. It is contended that an artificial liability has been created on the
tenants by the Finance Act, 1994 which introduced the service tax. Reference
has been made to sub-section 90(a) which was inserted in Section 65 of the
Finance Act, 1994 by the Finance Act, 2007 to tax any "service provided to any
person by any other person in relation to renting of immovable property for
use in the course or furtherance of business or commerce". The renting of
immovable property has been defined to include renting, letting, leasing,
licensing and other similar arrangements of immovable property for use in the
course of WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 15 of 100 furtherance
of business or commerce including use as factory, building, warehouse,
exhibition halls, multiple use building, etc. The said provision came into
force with effect from 1.6.2007. It is urged that contrary to the express
words of the provisions of the Act, the first respondent, placing an erroneous
interpretation on Section 65(105)(zzzz) as it stood in 2007, issued a
notification No.24/2007 dated 22.5.2007. After the notification was issued, a
circular dated 4.1.2008 was issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of
India. The constitutional validity of the notification and the circular was
questioned before this Court in the case of Home Solution Retail India Ltd. v.
Union of India, 158 (2009) DLT 722 (DB).

3\. In the case of Home Solution Retail India Ltd. (supra), it was contended
that the notification and circular had come into existence by absolute
fallacious interpretation placed on Section 65(105)(zzzz) and Section
65(90)(a) inasmuch as an attempt has been made to levy service tax on renting
of immovable property as opposed to the levy of service tax on the service
provided "in relation to renting of immovable property". The Division Bench
adverted to the language employed in the notification dated 22.5.2007 and the
circular dated 4.1.2008 and WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 16
of 100 after referring to the decisions in T.N. Kalyana Mandapam Association
v. Union of India & Others, (2004) 5 SCC 632, All India Federation of Tax
Practitioners & Ors. v. Union of India, (2007) 7 SCC 527, Doypack Systems
Private Limited v. Union of India, (1998) 2 SCC 299, BSNL v. Union of India,
(2006) 3 SCC 1, Commissioner of Income-tax, Bangalore v. B.C. Srinivasa
Shetty, (1981) 2 SCC 460, Lucknow Development Authroity v. MK Gupta, (1994) 1
SCC 243, NS Nayak and Sons v. State of Goa, (2003) 6 SCC 56 and interpreting
the terms "in relation thereto", distinguished the decision rendered in T.N.
Kalyana Mandapam Association (supra) holding that the utilization of premises
as a mandap by itself would constitute service as has been held by the Apex
Court but the same is different from the kind of activity that is contemplated
under Section 65(105)(zzzz). The Division Bench thereafter proceeded to state
as follows:

> "33. The next decision which requires consideration is the decision of the
> Supreme Court in the case of All India Federation of Tax Practitioners
> (supra). We have already quoted paragraph 8 of the said decision wherein it
> has been observed that service tax is a value added tax and that just as
> excise duty is a tax on value WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page
> 17 of 100 addition on goods, services tax is on value addition by rendition
> of services. A distinction has also been sought to be made between property

> As in the case of the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 18 of

> be provided to „A‟ by „B‟ in relation to „C‟, it is obvious that „C‟ can

> service by itself, such as real estate. The expression "in relation to"
> would, therefore, have different meanings depending on whether „C‟ is a
> service or is not a service. If „C‟ is a service, then the expression „in

> connection with the service „C‟. Where „C‟ is not a service, the expression
> „in relation to‟ would have reference only to some service which has a
> connection with „C‟. But, this would not imply that „C‟ itself is a service.

> 35\. From this analysis, it is clear that we have to understand as to

> within the ambit of Section 65(105)(zzzz) and would be exigible to service

> provided by some service provider. Insofar as WP(C) No.3398/2010 with

> as a service. Of course, if there is some other service, such as air
> conditioning service provided alongwith the renting of immovable property,
> then it would fall within Section 65(105)(zzzz).

> 36\. In view of the foregoing discussion, we hold that Section 65(105)(zzzz)
> does not in terms entail that the renting out of immovable property for use
> in the course or furtherance of business of commerce would by itself
> constitute a taxable service and be exigible to service tax under the said
> Act. The obvious consequence of this finding is that the interpretation
> placed by the impugned notification and circular on the said provision is
> not correct. Consequently, the same are ultra vires the said Act and to the
> extent that they authorize the levy of service tax on renting of immovable
> property per se, they are set aside.

> 37\. Before parting with this batch of cases, we would like to observe that
> we have not examined the alternative plea taken by the petitioners with

> 4\. From the aforesaid decision, it is quite vivid that the Division Bench

> sweep the renting out of immovable property for use in the course of
> furtherance of business or commerce to constitute a taxable service and
> thereby exigible to service tax and, accordingly, the notification and
> circular were declared ultra vires.

5\. After the said decision was rendered, Section 65(90)(a) and Sections 65
and 66 were amended. For the purpose of better appreciation, the provision
that existed prior to the Finance Act, 2010 and post amendment by the Finance
Act, 2010 are produced below in a tabular form:

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 24 of 100 Be it noted, the
amendments have been brought with retrospective effect.

6\. Challenging the validity of the amendments, Mr. Harish N. Salve, learned
senior counsel, has submitted that the Parliament has no authority to enact
the impugned legislation as renting of immovable property is a tax on lands
and buildings which squarely comes within Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution of India. The learned senior counsel further
submitted that the use of the word „taxes‟ in Entry 49 connotes a multitude of
taxes imposable on land when the renting of an immovable property would
squarely fall within Entry 49 of List II. Relying on the decision in State of
West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd., (2004) 10 SCC 20, it is submitted that
reading Entry 49 of List II in a wide manner, it would include all types of
taxes imposed or imposable on lands and buildings and the same would fall
within the exclusive authority of the State Legislature and in no manner would
come within the residuary Entry 97 of List I by virtue of which the Parliament
can legislate. He has propounded that the service tax imposed by the
Parliament on renting of immovable property takes into account the use of the
land or building, hence, it is a WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters
Page 25 of 100 tax which the State Legislatures alone could conceivably impose
under Entry 49 of List II. In order to buttress the aforesaid submission,
reliance has been placed on the decision in Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee v Local Board
of Barpeta, AIR 1965 SC 1561 wherein a tax had been imposed under Section 62
of the Assam Local Self Government Act, 1953 and while upholding the validity
of the tax, the Apex Court noted that the tax was, in substance, a tax on the
land but the charge only arose on the land which was used for a market.
Expanding the aforesaid stream of logic, the learned senior counsel submitted
that the act of renting of an immovable property by one person to another for
"commercial use" would come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State
Legislature.

7\. Pyramiding the above assertions, the learned senior counsel contended that
the impugned tax has direct nexus with the immovable property and is nothing
but a tax on land and buildings, the measure being the rent payable by the
tenant to the landlord for renting of the immovable property. There is no
difference between the transaction of renting of immovable property and the
property itself and, therefore, the provision is a colourable piece of
legislation. WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 26 of 100

8\. The second plank of the learned senior counsel‟s submissions emphasises on
the relevance of the concept of "Aspect Theory" to the Indian Constitutional
scheme. It is urged by him that the "aspect doctrine" is not applicable to the
Indian Constitutional scheme as there exist two separate Lists. As a
clarification, it is proponed that the "Aspect Theory" enunciated in
Federation of Hotel Restaurant Association of India (supra) limits itself only
to such aspects which could be directly covered by a specific entry in the two
Lists. It is urged by him that if Entry 97 is taken recourse to despite the
specific Entry of List II, it would create conflict and render the specific
Entry of List II subservient to the residuary Entry of List I which is not
permissible under the Constitutional scheme. Pressing into service the
decision in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. Vs. State of U.P., (2005) 2 SCC 515,
he further submitted that in the Indian context, if an aspect is covered by an
Entry in List I, then it cannot be said that another aspect cannot be taxed
under an Entry within List II. The same logic, however, does not extend to a
situation where the contest or cavil is between the residuary Entry within
List I and a specific Entry within List II.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 27 of 100

9\. Mr. Salve has further argued that in the light of the judgment rendered in
Home Solutions (supra), renting by the landlord for commercial purposes to the
tenant, per se, could not be construed as rendering of service. The concept of
"service seeker" and "service provider" as enunciated in the Finance Act 1994
is wholly absent in the impugned legislation. He further submitted that the
respondent‟s justification of the impost on the ground that the power to tax
rests with the Parliament, employing deeming fiction to describe the tax as a
service tax within the residuary power of the Parliament, is totally contrary
to the constitution bench judgment of the Apex Court in Godfrey Phillips India
Ltd. (supra) wherein it has been authoritatively pronounced that the
Parliament cannot employ a deeming fiction to bring in an incident of tax or a
taxable event within its fold. Highlighting the said proponement, it is urged
that merely describing the tax to be a "service tax" would not alter the
nature of the tax for being a tax on land and building and, therefore, the
Parliament does not have the legislative competence to introduce a deeming
fiction to tax renting of immovable property and, therefore, the impugned
provision deserves to be declared ultra vires.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 28 of 100

10\. Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing in some of the writ
petitions, has submitted at the fore that there is no service involved in the
letting of immovable property and consequently, it is not open to the
Parliament to impose service tax on the assumption that the taxable service is
involved in letting of immovable property. It is submitted by him that it is
well settled in law that the Legislature in enacting a law is entitled to
enact or prescribe a deeming fiction but the exercise of the said power comes
with a limitation that by deeming a fiction, the legislature cannot transgress
upon a constitutional restriction or the field of legislation that is reserved
or demarcated for another legislature. Alternatively, it is urged that any
legal fiction, embedded in the provisions of law enacted by the Legislature,
does not confer any legislative competence upon it which it does not otherwise
possess under the Constitution and the tax on the use of land and building for
a particular purpose being squarely covered under Entry 49 of List II cannot
be covered under the conception of „deemed‟. Edificing the said proposition
further, he submitted that letting of immovable property for commercial
purpose also constitutes a particular use of the property and, therefore, the
tax on such letting is squarely covered WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 29 of 100 under Entry 49 of List II. In this regard, reliance has
been placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in Kesoram Industries Limited
(supra).

11\. Dr. Singhvi, drawing analogy from the internationally followed
principles, further submitted that even internationally, leasing / letting of
immovable property is exempted from value added taxation since it has been
construed that the same does not provide any value addition and since the
Government of India has sought to rely upon the internationally accepted value
added tax regime, it needs to follow the same fully and exempt leasing /
letting of immovable property from the domain of value added tax. In this
regard, he has placed reliance on the decision of the House of Lords in
Commissioners of Custom and Excise v. Sinclair Collis Limited (2001) UKHL 30
(7th June, 2001).

12\. The learned senior counsel has further drawn inspiration from the
observations of the European Union Court in Belgium v. Temco Europe SA [Case
C-284/03 of 18.11.2004] wherein it has been held that if the leasing/ letting
of immovable property is a passive transaction, then it would be exempted.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 30 of 100

13\. Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel, analysing the anatomy of the
provisions under Section 65, submitted that among the taxable services, the
taxable service in Sub-clause (zzzz), to which the constitutional challenge in
these proceedings relates, was initially inserted by the Finance Act of 2007
with effect from 1st June 2007 and the taxable service was defined to mean
"any service provided or to be provided to any person, by any other person in
relation to renting of immovable property for use in the course or furtherance
of business or commerce" and, hence, in the absence of service component,
service tax cannot be imposed. Emphasis has been laid on the expression
"renting of immovable property" as defined in Clause (90)(a) of Section 65 of
the Act.

14\. It is his submission that letting of immovable property is merely a
property transaction and does not involve remotely any value addition
whatsoever which results from the rendering of the service and therefore, the
service tax is not leviable. He has heavily relied on the decision rendered in
All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (supra) wherein the Apex Court has
noted that a service tax is a tax on value addition made by rendering of
services.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 31 of 100

15\. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the impugned levy of
tax is nothing but a tax on the letting of immovable property and the same is
squarely covered by Entry 49 of List II and consequently, the Parliament has
no legislative competence to levy the said tax under residuary Entry 97 of
List I of the Seventh Schedule. The service tax imposed by the Parliament on
renting of immovable property, it is urged, takes account of the user of the
land or building and hence, it is a tax which the State Legislatures alone can
impose under Entry 49 of List II. The learned senior counsel has commended us
to the decisions in D.G. Gose Co. (Agents Pvt. Ltd.) vs. State of Kerala,
(1980) 2 SCC 410 and Goodricke Group Ltd. v. State of West Bengal, (1995)
Supp. 1 SCC 707 to highlight that Entry 49 of List II has been endowed with
wide range of coverage and interpretation.

16\. It is further canvassed by the learned senior counsel that under the
constitutional scheme, a single transaction or taxable event cannot be taxed
by both the Parliament and the State Legislature. It is argued by him that
there exists a meticulous separation of all the taxing powers of the
Parliament as compared to the taxing powers of the State in order to avoid any
kind of overlapping whatsoever between the two. WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 32 of 100 It is proponed that it has been held by the
Apex Court that the very same transaction cannot be subjected to tax by both
the Parliament and the State Legislature.

17\. Questioning the levy of service tax on renting of immovable property with
retrospective effect from 1st June 2007, he submitted that there can be no
retrospective authorization of penal action to be taken against assessees
including, in particular, the imposition of penalties or penal interest and
prosecution, and that such retrospective imposition of penal action would be
unconstitutional in the light of the decision in Star India Pvt. Ltd v. CCE,
(2005) 7 SCC 203.

18\. Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel, relying on All India Federation
of Tax Practitioners (supra) and Association of Leasing and Financial Service
Companies vs. Union of India and ors., (2011) 2 SCC 352, delineated at the
outset the essential features of service tax to mean that it is leviable only
on services provided by the service provider to its customer and it is
fundamentally and inseparably connected with the value addition. The learned
senior counsel has further submitted that renting of immovable property for
use in the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 33 of 100 course or
furtherance of business or commerce by itself does not entail any value
addition and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a service.

19\. The learned senior counsel has placed reliance on Hansraj & Sons v. State
of Jammu & Kashmir, (2002) 6 SCC 227, Member- Secretary, Andhra Pradesh State
Board for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution v. Andhra Pradesh Rayons
Ltd., (1989) 1 SCC 44, Saraswati Sugar Mills v. Haryana State Board, (1992) 1
SCC 418 and Commissioner of Gift Tax, Madras v. N.S. Getty Chettiar, (1971) 2
SCC 741 to reinforce his submission that the definition of „taxable service‟
is a matter which relates to chargeability and the charging provisions have to
be strictly construed.

20\. It is urged by Mr. Bagaria that the constitutional concepts relating to
service tax as laid down by the Apex Court cannot be whittled or nullified by
a statutory amendment. Elaborating further, it is put forth that a transaction
relating to mere renting of immovable property could never be termed as
rendering of any service giving rise to a value addition as the elements of
service as well as value addition are completely absent.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 34 of 100

21\. The learned senior counsel, placing reliance on Puran Singh Sahni v.
Sundari Bhagwandas Kripalani, (1991) 2 SCC 180, has submitted that in Section
65(90a), the expression „renting of immovable property‟ has been defined to
include renting, letting, leasing, licensing or other similar arrangements of
immovable property and all these activities of immovable property are
recognized in law as transfer of right in land/buildings by the lessor to the
lessee and the transaction is recognized as a transfer of property from the
lessor to the lessee under Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
and the instrument effectuating such a transfer defined as conveyance is
liable to stamp duty under the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The
learned senior counsel has placed reliance on Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (supra)
Goodricke Group Ltd. (supra) and International Tourist Corporation v. State of
Haryana, (1981) 2 SCC 318 and submitted that any tax levied on such
transaction, in pith and substance, is nothing else but a tax on land/building
under Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution as such
a transaction involves transfer of right to enjoy such property and has direct
nexus with the land/building in question. Therefore, the Parliament, by merely
giving WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 35 of 100 it a label of
service, cannot subject it to service tax as such an exercise is nothing but a
colourable exercise of power.

22\. Mr. A.S. Chandhiok, learned Additional Solicitor General, countering the
aforesaid submissions, has contended that by virtue of the amendment
incorporated by the Finance Act, 2010, the levy is on the very activity of
renting, leasing, letting, licensing of the immovable property or permitting
the immovable property through any arrangement whatsoever to be used in the
course or furtherance of business or commerce and for the said purpose,
transfer of right, title and interest is totally irrelevant. It is his further
submission that the activity which is sought to be taxed under Section
65(105)(zzzz) is allowing/permitting the usage of immovable property in the
course and furtherance of business which is neither covered under the Transfer
of Property Act nor under the Indian Easements Act and by no means is a tax on
land and building to come within the ambit and sweep of Entry 49 of List II of
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Combating the submission as regards
the legislative competence of the Parliament, the learned Addition Solicitor
General has submitted that in order to take aid of Entry 49 of List II,
certain conditions precedent are to be WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 36 of 100 satisfied such as the tax ought to be a direct tax on
land and building, and the land or building is to be taxed as units of
taxation as it has no concern with ownership, division of interest or
occupation. That apart, submits Mr. Chandhiok, it does not cover indirect tax
on land and building and as a natural corollary, ousts tax on income from land
or building from its purview. It is canvassed by him that the tax in the
present case is an indirect tax and the impost is on the activity and not on
renting or leasing. It is canvassed by him that the subject of tax or the
event of taxation is different from the measure of levy and the mode of
assessment and the latter cannot be taken into consideration for determining
the nature and character of tax.

23\. Mr. Chandhiok has urged that Kesoram's case (supra) could not be relied
upon to justify the impugned levy under Entry 49 of List II inasmuch as the
levy therein was a direct tax on land and the measure of the said direct tax
on land was classified on the basis of different users of land at different
rates. It is submitted by him that the issue to be dealt with therein was
whether the tax was on land falling under List II or on the Coal Mines or Tea
Estate which is a subject matter of List I. The court interpreted the said
provisions and concluded that the tax WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 37 of 100 under the said provisions would remain tax on land
irrespective of use to which it is put because classification of land in
different identifiable groups was only for the purpose of taxation.
Distinguishing the decision in Ajoy Kumar (supra), the learned Additional
Solicitor General submitted that in the said case, the levy was directly on
land itself but was to be measured/recovered when it was being used as market
and the Apex Court had concluded that the tax was on land but the charge arose
only when the land was used for a market, whereas in the present case, the
levy is not on land but on the activity of renting, leasing, letting,
licensing, allowing and permitting the usage of immovable property in the
course or furtherance of business or commerce.

24\. The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that a tax on land is
to be measured with reference to its income and nothing else and in the case
of DG Fose and Co.(Agents) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), tax was levied directly on
building and was measured on the basis of annual value which was challenged on
the ground that the State Legislature had no competence because only the Union
had the power to levy tax on annual capital value which was rejected by the
court by reiterating WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 38 of 100
the law that the legislature was free to take a decision as to the measure of
tax but the same is not the situation in the case at hand. The learned ASG,
deriving strength from the decisions in Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Assn.
(supra); All India Federation of Tax Practitioners and Ors. (supra) and
Association of Leasing and Financial Service Companies (supra), also submitted
that levy of service tax under Article 248(2) read with Entry 97 of List I is
permissible.

25\. On the nature of service tax, the learned ASG submitted that besides the
fact that service is inherent under Section 65(90a) and Section 65(105)(zzzz),
there is value addition and the whole activity has an inseparable nexus with
commercial activity. Emphasizing on the concept of Value Added Tax (VAT), it
is submitted by him that VAT was based on the additional services and the
related VAT liability of the service provider can be calculated by deducting
input tax credit from the tax collected on the services making it a multi
point tax on value addition which is collected at different stages of
providing services with provision for set off for the tax paid at the previous
stage / tax on inputs. In this regard, the learned ASG has referred to the
statutory provisions of the Central Excise Act, 1944, the Finance Act, WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 39 of 100 1994 and the CENVAT Credit
Rules, 2004, Dr. Raja J. Chelliah Committee‟s report on tax reforms as well as
the decision in All India Federation of Tax Practitioners and Ors. (supra)
wherein the Supreme Court has described service tax as VAT.

26\. The learned ASG, justifying the retrospective operation of the impugned
provisions, in his final lap, submitted that only the retrospective operation
of Section 65(105)(zzzz) had been challenged and that too as an alternative
relief. It is submitted that by virtue of Section 76(a)(6)(h) of the Finance
Act, 2010, Section 65(105)(zzzz) had been amended to clarify the intent of the
legislature w.e.f. 11.5.2007 and further Section 77 of the Finance Act, 2010
validated all actions. Referring to the first Home Solutions case (supra), the
learned ASG submitted that the court, in the said case, had not quashed or
invalidated the substantive provisions of law which still remains intact.
Further, relying on the decisions in Empire Industries Limited and Ors. v.
Union of India and Ors., (1985) 3 SCC 314, Pyare Lal Sharma Vs Managing
Director and Ors., (1989) 3 SCC 488 and A. Manjula Bhashini and Ors. v. The
Managing Director, A.P. Women's Cooperative Finance Corporation Ltd. and Anr.,
(2009) 8 WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 40 of 100 SCC 431, it
is submitted that the legislature has the power to amend the law with
retrospective effect.

27\. Pressing into service the decision in Shiv Dutt Rai Fateh Chand and Ors.
v. Union of India and Anr., (1983) 3 SCC 529 wherein the Supreme Court had
upheld the levy of penalty in the year 1996 with effect from 1957, the learned
ASG submitted that penalty can also be levied retrospectively.

28\. In response to the aforesaid submission, the petitioners in their
rejoinder, citing the decision in Governor-General in Council v. Province of
Madras, AIR 1945 PC 98 which was followed by the Supreme Court in R.R.
Engineering Co. v. Zilla Parishad, (1980) 3 SCC 330, have submitted that the
name given to a tax is immaterial and has no impact or bearing on the issue of
its constitutional validity. It is also submitted that the mere fact that
Section 65 (105) (zzzz) of the Finance Act regarded the letting of immovable
property for commercial purpose as a service and proceeded to levy service tax
on the same does not lead to the conclusion that the said tax was in reality
and in substance a service tax. The issue of constitutional validity of a
WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 41 of 100 tax/levy depends on
its essential nature and not merely its nomenclature.

29\. It is further reiterated that it is a settled legal position that the
legal fiction contained in the provisions of law enacted by the Legislature
does not confer any legislative competence upon the Legislature. In this
context, the decisions in State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. Ltd.,
(1959) SCR 379, Bhopal Sugar Industries v. Sales Tax Officer, (1964) 1 SCR
481, Twentieth Century Finance Co. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, (2000) 6 SCC
12; All India Federation of Tax Practitioner's case (supra) Tamil Nadu
Kalyanmandapam Association (supra) and Association of Leasing and Financial
Service Companies (supra) have been pressed into service.

30\. To appreciate the contentions raised at the Bar, first, we shall advert
to the schematic concept pertaining to the "fields of legislation". In Raja
Jagannath Baksh Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another, AIR 1962 SC 1563,
while dealing with Articles 245 and 246, it has been held that it is an
elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used in the
Constitution which confer legislative power WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 42 of 100 must receive the most liberal construction and if they
are words of wide amplitude, they must be interpreted so as to give effect to
that amplitude. It would be out of place to put a narrow or restricted
construction on words of wide amplitude in the Constitution. A general word
used in an entry must be construed to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary
matters which can fairly and reasonably be held to be included in it.

31\. In Union of India and others v. Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra Teachers College,
AIR 2002 SC 3675, it has been laid down that the power to legislate is
engrafted under Article 246 of the Constitution and the various entries in the
three lists of the Seventh Schedule are the "fields of legislation". The
different entries being legislative heads are all of enabling character and
are designed to define and delimit the respective areas of legislative
competence of the Union and the State Legislature. They neither impose any
restrictions on the legislative powers nor prescribe any duty for the exercise
of legislative power in any particular manner. It has been a cardinal
principle of construction that the language of the entries should be given the
widest scope by which their meaning is fairly capable of and while
interpreting an entry WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 43 of 100
of any List, it would not be reasonable to import any limitation therein. The
rule of widest construction, however, would not enable the legislature to make
a law relating to a matter which has no rational connection with the subject
matter of an entry. Their Lordships have further opined that it is a well-
settled principle that the entries in the different lists should be read
together without giving a narrow meaning to any of them. The power of the
Parliament as well as the State legislature is expressed in precise and
definite terms. While an entry is to be given its widest meaning, it cannot be
so interpreted as to override another entry or make another entry meaningless
and in case of an apparent conflict between different entries, it is the duty
of the Court to reconcile them. When it appears to the Court that there is
apparent overlapping between the two entries, the doctrine of "pith and
substance" has to be applied to find out the true nature of a legislation and
the entry within which it would fall. In case of conflict between the entries
in List I and List II, the same has to be decided by application of the
principle of "pith and substance". The doctrine of "pith and substance" means
that if an enactment substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred
by the Constitution upon the legislature WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 44 of 100 which enacted it, it cannot be held to be invalid
merely because it incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another
legislature. When a law is impugned as being ultra-vires of the legislative
competence, what is required to be ascertained is the true character of the
legislation. If, on such an examination, it is found that the legislation is
in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature, then it must be held
to be valid in its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on
matters which are beyond its competence. In order to examine the true
character of the enactment, the entire Act, its object and scope and effect is
required to be gone into. The question of invasion into the territory of
another legislation is to be determined not by degree but by substance.

32\. In Dharam Dutta and others v. Union of India and others, AIR 2004 SC
1295, it has been held thus:

> "72. The various entries in the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule are
> legislative heads defining the fields of legislation and should be liberally
> and widely interpreted. Not only the main matter but also any incidental and
> ancillary matters are available to be included within the field of the
> entry. The settled rules of interpretation governing the entries do not
> countenance any narrow and pedantic interpretation. The judicial opinion is
> for WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 45 of 100 giving a large
> and liberal interpretation to the scope of the entries. Suffice it to quote
> from the opinion of the judicial Committee of the Privy Council in British
> Coal Corporation v. The King, AIR 1935 PC 158, 162 - that in interpreting a
> constituent or organic statute indeed that construction which is most
> beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted.
> The Federal Court in the United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum , AIR 1941 FC 16,
> 25 observed that none of the items in the lists is to be read in a narrow or
> restricted sense and all ancillary or subsidiary matters referable to the
> words used in the entry and which can fairly and reasonably be said to be
> comprehended therein are to be read in the entry. This approach has been
> countenanced in several decisions of this Court. (To wit, see Navinchandra
> Mafatlal v. CIT Bombay City (1955) 1 SCR 829, 836 : AIR 1955 SC 58 at p.61;
> Sri Ram Ram Narain Medhi v. State of Bombay , 1959 Supp (1) SCR 989 : AIR
> 1959 SC 459)"

33\. In State of Andhra Pradesh v. K. Purushotham Reddy and others, AIR 2003
SC 1956, it has been held that the conflict in the legislative competence of
the Parliament and the State Legislatures having regard to Article 246 of the
Constitution of India must be viewed in the light of the settled position of
law which, in no uncertain terms, lays down that each Entry has to be
interpreted in a broad manner. Both the Parliamentary legislation as also the
State legislation must be considered in such a manner as to uphold both of
them and WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 46 of 100 only in a
case where it is found that both cannot co-exist, the State Act may be
declared ultra vires. Clause I of Article 246 of the Constitution of India
does not provide for the competence of the Parliament or the State
Legislatures as is ordinarily understood but merely provides for the
respective legislative fields. Furthermore, the Courts should proceed to
construe a statute with a view to uphold its constitutionality.

34\. In Welfare Association, A.R.P., Maharashtra and another v. Ranjit P.
Gohil and others, (2003) 9 SCC 358, while dealing with the concept of
colourable legislation, it has been held that the said doctrine fundamentally
dealt with the question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a
particular law. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the
motives which impelled it to act are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if
the legislature lacks competency, the question of motives does not arise at
all. Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a question of
power (vide Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol.1, p.379). The crucial
question to be asked is whether there has been a transgression of legislative
authority as conferred by the Constitution which is the source of all powers
as also the separation of powers. A legislative transgression may be WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 47 of 100 patent, manifest or direct,
or may also be disguised, covert and indirect. It is to this latter class of
cases that the expression "colourable legislation" has been applied in certain
judicial pronouncements. The expression means that although apparently a
legislature, in passing a statute, purports to act within the limits of its
powers, yet in substance and in reality, it transgresses those powers, the
transgression being veiled by what appears, on a proper examination, to be a
mere pretence or disguise. The discerning test is to find out the substance of
the Act and not merely the form or outward appearance. If the subject-matter
in substance is something which is beyond the legislative power, the form in
which the law is clothed would not save it from condemnation. The
constitutional prohibitions cannot be allowed to be violated by employing
indirect methods. To test the true nature and character of the challenged
legislation, the investigation by the court should be directed towards
examining (i) the effect of the legislation, and (ii) its object, purpose or
design. In the said decision, it has been opined that while interpreting and
construing, an effort ought to be made to make the entries effective instead
of rendering them otiose. It is the duty of the court to examine the pith and
substance of the Act to find out WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters
Page 48 of 100 whether the matter substantially falls under a particular entry
in a list or not.

35\. In Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., AIR
1970 SC 1453, it has been held as follows:

> "6. ....The entries in the three Lists are only legislative heads or fields
> of legislation; they demarcate the area over which the appropriate
> legislatures can operate. It is well established that the widest amplitude
> should be given to the language of the entries. But some of the entries in
> the different lists or in the same list may overlap or may appear to be in
> direct conflict with each other. It is then the duty of this Court to

> The Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants
> Taxation Act, 1938, 1939 FCR 18 = (AIR 1939 FC 1), Sir Maurice Gwyer
> proceeded to state:

> "Only in the Indian Constitution Act can the particular problem arise which
> is now under consideration; and an endeavour must be made to solve it, as
> the Judicial Committee have said by having recourse to the context and
> scheme of the Act, and a reconciliation attempted between two apparently
> conflicting jurisdictions by reading the two entries together and by
> interpreting, and, where necessary, modifying, the language of the one by
> that of the other. If indeed such a reconciliation should prove impossible,
> then, and only then, will the non obstante clause operate and the federal
> power prevail; for the clause ought to be regarded as a WP(C) No.3398/2010
> with connected matters Page 49 of 100 last resource, a witness to the
> imperfections of human expression and the fallibility of legal
> draftsmanship."

> After so stating, their Lordships further proceeded to state as follows:

> "7. ....It is well settled that the entries in the three lists are only
> legislative heads or fields of legislation and they demarcate the area over
> which the appropriate legislature can operate. The legislative entries must
> be given a large and liberal interpretation, the reason being that the
> allocation of subjects to the list is not by way of scientific or logical
> definition but is a mere enumeration of broad and comprehensive
> categories....."

> 36\. We have referred to the aforesaid decisions only to understand the
> purpose behind the various entries relating to legislation by the Parliament
> as well as the State Legislature, the field of legislation, the doctrine of
> "pith and substance", adoption of a non-pedantic approach, interpretation on
> a wider spectrum, the true character of the enactment by paving the path of
> real substance, and the demarcation of the areas of legislation, incidental
> and ancillary encroachment, design of the statute and substantial
> entrenchment.

37\. Presently, we shall proceed to refer to certain authorities which pertain
to the imposition of tax on land as it is imperative to scan and WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 50 of 100 understand what is exactly
meant by "taxes on lands and buildings". Entry 49 of List II reads as follows:

> "49. Taxes on lands and buildings.

> If therefore a tax is directly imposed on "buildings", it will bear a direct
> relation to the buildings owned by the assessee. It may be that the building
> owned by an assessee may be a component of his total assets, but a tax under
> Entry 86 will not bear any direct or definable relation to his building. A
> tax on "buildings" is therefore a direct tax on the assessee‟s buildings as
> such, and is not a personal tax without reference to any particular
> property.

38\. In Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (supra), the Constitution Bench, placing reliance
on Ralla Ram v. Province of East Punjab, AIR 1949 FC 81, opined as follows:

> "It is well-settled that the entries in the three legislative lists have to
> be interpreted in their widest amplitude and, therefore, if a tax can
> reasonably be held to be a tax on land it will come within entry 49. Further
> it is equally well-settled that tax on land may be based on the annual value
> of the land and would still be a tax on land and would not be beyond the
> competence of the State legislature on the ground that it is a tax on
> income. [see Ralla Ram v. province of East Punjab, 1948 FCR 207 : (AIR 1949
> FC 81)]. It follows, therefore, that the use to which the land is put can be
> taken into account in imposing a tax on it within the meaning of entry 49 of
> List II, for the annual value of land which can certainly be taken into
> WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 51 of 100 account in imposing
> a tax for the purpose of this entry would necessarily depend upon the use to
> which the land is put."

39\. In Sudhir Chandra Nawn v. Wealth-tax Officer, Calcutta and others, AIR
1969 SC 59, it was held that the power to levy tax on lands and buildings
under Entry 49 of List II did not trench upon a power conferred on the
Parliament by Entry 88 of List I and, therefore, the enactment of the Wealth
Tax Act by the Parliament was not ultra vires. In the said case, it has been
opined as follows:

> "...But the legislative authority of Parliament is not determined by
> visualizing the possibility of exceptional cases of taxes under two
> different heads operating similarly on tax payers. Again entry 49 List II of
> the Seventh Schedule contemplates the levy of tax on lands and buildings or
> both as units. It is normally not concerned with the division of interest or
> ownership in the units of lands or buildings which are brought to tax. Tax
> on lands and buildings is directly imposed on lands and buildings, and bears
> a definite relation to it. Tax on the capital value of assets bears no
> definable relation to lands and buildings which may form a component of the
> total assets of the assessee. By legislation in exercise of power under
> entry 86 List I tax is contemplated to be levied on the value of the assets.
> For the purpose of levying tax under entry 49 List II the State Legislature
> may adopt for determining the incidence of tax the annual or the capital
> value of the lands and buildings. But the adoption of the annual or capital
> value of lands and buildings for determining tax WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
> connected matters Page 52 of 100 liability will not, in our judgment, make

40\. In The Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax and others v. The
Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd., Etc., 1969 (2) SCC 55, the challenge was to
the Madras Urban Land Tax Act, 1966. A contention was raised that the impunged
Act fell in Schedule VII, List I, Entry 86 as the impugned Act was, both in
form and substance, taxation of capital and, hence, beyond the competence of
the State Legislature. In that context, their Lordships opined that the
legislative entries must be given a large and liberal interpretation, the
reason being that the allocation of the subjects to the list is not by way of
scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere sixplex enumeratio of
broad categories and, therefore, there is no conflict between Entry 86 of List
I and Entry 49 of List II as the basic taxation under the two entries is quite
distinct. Their Lordships proceeded to state that in Entry 86 of List I, the
basis of taxation is the capital value of the asset and it is not a tax
directly on the capital value of the assets of individuals and companies on
the valuation data and, therefore, the tax is not imposed on the components of
the assets of the assessee. Their Lordships further stated that the tax under
Entry 86 proceeds on the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 53 of
100 principle of aggregation and is imposed on the totality of the value of
all the assets. After so stating, their Lordships proceeded to state as
follows:

> "...It is imposed on the total assets which the assessee owns and in
> determining the net wealth not only the encumbrances specifically charged
> against any item of asset, but the general liability of the assessee to pay
> his debts and to discharge his lawful obligations have to be taken into
> account. In certain exceptional cases, where a person owes no debts and is
> under no enforceable obligation to discharge any liability out of his assets
> it may be possible to break up the tax which is leviable on the total assets
> into components and attribute a component to lands and buildings owned by an
> assessee. In such a case, the component out of the total tax attributable to
> lands and buildings may in the matter of computation bear similarity to a
> tax on lands and buildings levied on the capital or annual value under Entry
> 49, List II. But in a normal case a tax on capital value of assets bears no
> definable relation to lands and buildings which may or may not form a
> component of the total assets of the assessee. But Entry 49 of List II,
> contemplates a levy of tax on lands and buildings or both as units. It is
> not concerned with the division of interest or ownership in the units of
> lands or buildings which are brought to tax. Tax on lands and buildings, is
> directly imposed on lands and buildings and bears a definite relation to it.
> Tax on the capital value of assets bears no definable relation to lands and

> fall on different subject-matters."

> 41\. In The Second Gift Tax Officer, Mangalore v. D.H. Hazareth, AIR 1970 SC
> 999, the Apex Court, while dealing with the impost or tax on gifts of lands
> and buildings, referred to Article 248 which ("imposition of" or "impost

42\. In D.G. Bose & Co. (Agents) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the constitutional
validity of the Kerala Building Tax Act, 1975 was challenged before the High
Court of Kerala which upheld the validity of the Act. The principal contention
that was canvassed before the Apex Court was that the subject matter of the
Act being a tax on building is a tax on the capital value of the asset of an
individual or a company and falls within the scope of Entry 86 of List I of
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and not under Entry 49 of List II
and, therefore, it travels beyond the legislative competence of the State
Legislature. Their Lordships referred to the concept of tax as defined under
Clause (28) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, adverted to Entry 86
and thereafter, while dealing with Entry 49, proceeded to state as follows:

> "8. On the other hand, Entry 49 of List II is as follows:

> 49\. Taxes on lands and buildings.

> If therefore a tax is directly imposed on "buildings", it will bear a direct
> relation to the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 57 of 100
> buildings owned by the assessee. It may be that the building owned by an
> assessee may be a component of his total assets, but a tax under Entry 86
> will not bear any direct or definable relation to his building. A tax on
> "buildings" is therefore a direct tax on the assessee‟s buildings as such,
> and is not a personal tax without reference to any particular property.

> 9\. It has to be appreciated that in almost all cases, a tax has two
> elements which have been precisely stated by Seervai in his "Constitutional
> Law of India", second edition, Volume 2, as follows, as page 1258:

> Another principle for reconciling apparently conflicting tax entries follows
> from the fact that a tax has two elements: the person, thing or activity on
> which the tax is imposed, and the amount of the tax. The amount may be
> measured in many ways; but decided cases establish a clear distinction
> between the subject- matter of a tax and the standard by which the amount of
> tax is measured. These two elements are described as the subject of a tax
> and the measure of a tax.

> It may well be that one‟s building may imperceptibly be the subject-matter
> of tax, say the wealth tax, as a component of his assets, under Entry 86
> (List I); and it may also be subjected to tax, say a direct tax under Entry
> 46 (sic 49) (List II), but as the two taxes are separate and distinct

> competence of the legislatures concerned."

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 58 of 100

After so stating, their Lordships referred to the decisions in Sudhir Chandra
Nawn (supra) and Buckingham and Carnauc Co. Ltd. (supra) and eventually held
that the State Legislature was competent to tax the building under Entry 49 of
List II.

43\. In Union of India v. Harbhajan Singh Dhillon, AIR 1972 SC 1061, while
dealing with the requisites of a tax under Entry 49 of List II, their
Lordships have ruled thus:

> "65. The requisites of a tax under entry 49, List II may be summarised thus:

> (1) It must be a tax on units, that is lands and buildings separately as
> units.

> (2) The tax cannot be a tax on totality, i.e. it is not a composite tax on
> the value of all lands and buildings.

> (3) The tax is not concerned with the division of interest in the building
> or land. In other words, it is not concerned whether one person owns or
> occupies it or two or more persons own or occupy it.

> 66\. In short, the tax under entry 49 List II is not a personal tax but a
> tax on property."

44\. In Kesoram Industries Ltd. & Ors., (supra), the Constitution Bench, after
dwelling upon the principle of interpretation relating to WP(C) No.3398/2010
with connected matters Page 59 of 100 Articles 246, 265 and the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution and the scheme and nature of the power to
legislate, per majority, opined that if any power to tax is clearly mentioned
in List II, the same would not be available to be exercised by the Parliament
based on the presumption of residuary power. In the said case, while dealing
with the concept of land in terms of Entry 49, List II, it has been stated
that it has wide connotation and the land remains land though it may be
subject to different uses. The nature of use of the land would not enable a
piece of land to be taken out of the meaning of land itself. It has been ruled
therein that to be a tax on land, the levy must have some direct and definite
relationship with the land and so long as the tax is a tax on land by bearing
such relationship with the land, it is open to the legislature, for the
purpose of levying tax, to adopt any one of the well known modes of
determining the value of the land such as annual or capital value of the land
or its productivity. It has been further held that the methodology adopted,
having an indirect relationship with the land, would not alter the nature of
the tax as being one on the land. The Constitution Bench has also laid
emphasis on the aspect that the primary object and the essential purpose of
the legislation must be WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 60 of
100 distinguished from its ultimate or incidental results or consequences for
determining the character of the levy. A levy essentially in the nature of a
tax and within the power of the State Legislature cannot be annulled as
unconstitutional merely because it may have an effect on the price of the
commodity. A State legislation which makes provisions for levying a cess,
whether by way of tax to augment the revenue resources of the State or by way
of fee to render services as quid pro quo but without any intention of
regulating and controlling the subject of the levy, cannot be said to have
encroached upon the field of regulation and control belonging to the Central
Government by reason of the incidence of the levy being permissible to be
passed on to the buyer or consumer and thereby affecting the price of the
commodity or goods. Be it noted, in the said case, their Lordships were
dealing with a case whereby a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court had struck
down certain levies by way of cess on coal as unconstitutional for want of
legislative competence of the State legislature.

45\. In Lt. Col. Sawai Bhawani Singh and others v. State of Rajasthan and
others, (1996) 3 SCC 105, while dealing with wealth tax under Entry 49 of List
II, their Lordships have held that in pith and WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 61 of 100 substance, it was a tax on property and not a
personal tax. As per Entry 49 of List II, the State Legislature is competent
to impose tax either on lands or on buildings or on both. A land or building
or both of a person may be subjected to direct tax by the State Legislature
under Entry 49 of List II and may also be the subject-matter of direct tax as
a component of his total assets, like wealth tax by the Union Legislature as
mentioned in Entry 86 of List I. These two taxes are separate and distinct in
nature and it cannot be said that there is any overlapping or that the State
Legislature is not competent to levy such tax on lands and buildings merely on
the ground that they have been subjected to another tax as a component of the
total assets of the person concerned.

46\. From the aforesaid enunciation of law in various authorities, the
following principles can be culled out:

(a) Under Entry 49 of List II, the State Legislature is competent to impose
tax either on lands or buildings or on both. It is basically a tax on
property.

(b) Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule contemplates levy of tax on
lands and buildings or both as units.

(c) The levy of tax on lands and buildings is not concerned with the WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 62 of 100 division of interest or
ownership in the units of lands or buildings which are brought to tax. Tax on
lands and buildings is directly imposed on lands and buildings and bears a
definite relation to it.

(d) The tax on land and building is a fundamental tax resting upon the general
ownership of the lands and buildings but would not include a particular act
like a transmission of title by gift.

(e) There is a distinction between a direct tax on the assessee‟s building as
such and a personal tax.

(f) There is a distinction between the elements of tax, namely, the person,
thing or activity on which the tax is imposed and the amount of tax.

(g) A tax may imperceptibly be the subject-matter of tax like wealth tax and
may be subjected to tax as a direct tax under Entry 49 of List II.

(h) To be a tax on land, the levy must have some direct and definite
relationship with the land and as long as the tax is a tax on land by bearing
such relationship with the land, it is open to the State legislature, for the
purpose of levying tax, to adopt any one of WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 63 of 100 the well known modes of determining the value of the
land such as annual or capital value of the land or its productivity. The
methodology adopted, having an indirect relationship with the land, would not
alter the nature of the tax as being one on land.

(i) While dealing with the tax on the subject, thing or activity, the primary
object and the essential purpose of the legislation must be distinguished from
its ultimate or incidental results or consequences for determining the
character of the levy.

(j) If a tax is imposed on any transaction in the market by persons who come
there for business, it is not imposed on land but on the business involved
therein.

(k) A tax levied on activity or service rendered having nexus with land or
building would not come within the compartment of tax on land and building.

Be it noted, we have culled out the aforesaid principles for the sake of
clarity and convenience.

47\. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners would contend
that the levy of service tax on renting or leasing of immovable property or
having similar arrangement of immovable property for use WP(C) No.3398/2010
with connected matters Page 64 of 100 in the course of furtherance of business
or commerce is fundamentally a tax on the land which comes squarely within the
legislative competence of the State Legislature. As has been noted
hereinbefore, it has been vehemently urged that by introducing the doctrine of
"pith and substance" or "aspect doctrine", it cannot be brought under Entry 97
of List I under the residuary power of the Parliament. That apart, it has been
highlighted that there is no service rendered when the premises are let out
and it is a direct tax on land and, therefore, it is a colourable piece of
legislation by the Parliament and there is a direct entrenchment. Emphasis has
been laid on the first Home Solutions case (supra) to bolster the submission
that in the absence of any value addition, which is the essential and
fundamental component of service tax, the levy is unconstitutional. Regard
being had to the aforesaid facets, we think it seemly to advert to the
principles that have been laid down by the Apex Court pertaining to service
tax in various decisions.

48\. In T.N. Kalyana Mandapam Association (supra), the assail was to the
constitutional validity of Sections 66, 67(o) of the Finance Act, 1994 and
Rule 2(1)(d)(ix) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 and other provisions relating
to Kalyana Mandapams and Mandap keepers. Sub- WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 65 of 100 sections 65(8), (19) and (20) of the Finance
Act, 1994 defined „caterer‟, „mandap‟ and „mandap keepers‟. Section 65(41)(p)
defines „taxable service‟ to mean any service provided to a client by a mandap
keeper in relation to the use of a mandap in any manner including the
facilities provided to the client in relation to such use and also the
services, if any, rendered as a caterer. The challenge to the constitutional
validity before the High Court had met with failure. Before the Apex Court, it
was the principal contention that the service tax on the mandap keepers is a
colourable legislation and unconstitutional as the said tax is not on services
but is, in pith and substance, only a "tax on goods" and/or land and the
provisions are not within the legislative competence of the Union of India but
within the competence of the State Legislature. Their Lordships posed six
questions, one of which being relevant is reproduced hereinbelow:

> "Was the High Court correct in not construing the specific entries in List
> II viz. Entries 18, 49 and 54 by giving the widest amplitude, particularly
> when the Union was seeking to justify the levy under the residuary Entry 97
> in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution?"

Answering the said question, their Lordships opined that service tax is
imposed by the Parliament pursuant to the residuary power under WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 66 of 100 Entry 97 of List I read
with Article 246 of the Constitution. Thereafter, their Lordships proceeded to
state as follows:

> "46. It is well settled that the measure of taxation cannot affect the
> nature of taxation and, therefore, the fact that service tax is levied as a
> percentage of the gross charges for catering cannot alter or affect the
> legislative competence of Parliament in the matter.

> xxx xxx xxx

> 51\. Taxable services, therefore, could include the mere providing of
> premises on a temporary basis for organising any official, social or
> business functions, but would also include other facilities supplied in
> relation thereto. No distinction from restaurants, hotels, etc. which
> provide limited access to property for specific purpose.

> xxx xxx xxx

> 53\. It is also emphasized that a tax cannot be struck down on the ground of
> lack of legislative competence by enquiring whether the definition accords
> with what the layman‟s view of service is. It is well settled that in
> matters of taxation laws, the court permits greater latitude to pick and
> choose objects and rates for taxation and has a wide discretion with regard
> thereto. We may in this context refer to the decision of Mafatlal Industries
> Ltd. v. Union of India (SCC para 343, at pp.740-

> 41):

> "In the matter of taxation laws, the court permits a great latitude to the
> discretion of the legislature. The State is allowed to pick and WP(C)
> No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 67 of 100 choose districts,
> objects, persons, methods and even rates for taxation, if it does so
> reasonably. The courts view the laws relating to economic activities with
> greater latitude than other matters."

> 54\. Therefore, a levy of service tax on a particular kind of service could
> not be struck down on the ground that it does not conform to a common
> understanding of the word "service" so long as it does not transgress any
> specific restriction contained in the Constitution.

> 55\. In fact, making available a premises for a period of a few hours for
> the specific purpose of being utilized as a mandap whether with or without
> other services would itself be a service and cannot be classified as any
> other kind of legal concept. It does not certainly involve transfer of
> movable property nor does it involve transfer of movable property of any
> kind known to law either under the Transfer of Property Act or otherwise and
> can only be classified as a service."

49\. In Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 2005 SC 3020, the
challenge was to the legislative competence of the Parliament to impose
service tax on carriage of goods by transport operators. It was urged that the
matter came exclusively under Entry 56 of List II of the Seventh Schedule
which pertains to "taxes on goods and passengers covered by road or inland
water ways". Their Lordships noted that service tax is distinct from a tax on
the sale or WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 68 of 100 hire
purchase of goods and from a tax on land. While dealing with the specific
issue, the Apex Court has stated thus:

> "32. It is clear therefore that Section 66 read with Section 65(41)(j) and
> (ma) Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 do not seek to levy tax on goods or
> passengers. The subject matter of tax under those provisions of the Finance
> Act, 1994 is not goods and passengers, but the service of transportation
> itself. It is a levy distinct from the levy envisaged under Entry 56. It may
> be that both the levies are to be measured on the same basis, but that does
> not make the levy the same. As was held in Federation of Hotel and
> Restaurant Association of India etc. v. Union of India and others (1989) 3
> SCC 634:

> "..... subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the
> power of a particular legislature may in another aspect and for another
> purpose fall within another legislative power..... Indeed, the law „with
> respect to‟ a subject might incidentally „affect‟ another subject in some
> way, but that is not the same thing as the law being on the latter subject.
> There might be overlapping; but the overlapping must be in law. The same
> transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects.
> But the fact that there is an overlapping does not detract from the
> distinctiveness of the aspects." (pg.652-

> 653).

> 33\. Since service Tax is not a levy on passengers and goods but on the
> event of service in connection with the carriage of goods, it is not
> therefore possible to hold that the Act in pith and substance is within the
> States exclusive power under Entry 56 of WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
> matters Page 69 of 100 List II. What the Act ostensibly seeks to tax is what
> it, in substance, taxes. In the circumstances, the Act could not be termed
> to be a colourable piece of legislation. It is not the case of the
> petitioners that the Act is referable to any other entry apart from Entry 56
> of List II. Therefore the negation of the petitioners submission perforce
> leads to the conclusion that the Act falls within the residuary power of
> Parliament under Entry 97 of List I."

50\. In All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (supra), a Division Bench
decision of the Bombay High Court upholding the legislative competence of the
Parliament to levy service tax vide the Finance Act, 1994 and the Finance
(No.2) Act, 1998 was assailed before the Apex Court. The issue that arose
pertained to the competence of the Parliament to levy service tax on
practising Chartered Accountants and Architects having regard to Entry 60,
List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and Article 276 of the
Constitution. Their Lordships referred to the reasons for imposition of
service tax, the scheme of the Finance Act, 1994 and the Finance Act, 1998,
the relevant provisions of the Constitution of India and dealt with the
meaning of service tax. While dealing with the concept and meaning of service
tax, their Lordships opined that the concept of service tax is an economic
concept. Thereafter, the Apex Court proceeded to state that as an WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 70 of 100 economic concept, there is
no distinction between the consumption of goods and consumption of service as
both satisfy human needs. It is this economic concept based on the legal
principle of equivalence which now stands incorporated in the Constitution
vide the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003. Further, it is
important to note that "service tax" is a value added tax which, in turn, is a
general tax which applies to all commercial activities involving production of
goods and provision of service. Moreover, VAT is a consumption tax as it is
borne by the client, that is, the person who enjoys the benefit or avails the
service. Thereafter, their Lordships referred to the decision in Moti
Laminates (P) Ltd. v. CCE, (1995) 3 SCC 23 and opined thus:

> 24\. The importance of the above judgment of this Court is twofold. Firstly,
> applying the principle of equivalence, there is no difference between
> production or manufacture of saleable goods and production of
> marketable/saleable services in the form of an activity undertaken by the
> service provider for consideration, which correspondingly stands consumed by
> the service receiver. It is this principle of equivalence which is in-built
> into the concept of service tax, which has received legal support in the
> form of the Finance Act, 1994. To give an illustration, an Event Manager
> (professional) undertakes an activity, namely, of organizing shows. He
> belongs to the profession of WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page
> 71 of 100 Event Management. As long as he is in the business or calling or
> profession of an Event Manager, he is liable to pay the tax on profession,
> calling or trade under Entry 60 of List II. However, that tax under Entry 60
> of List II will not cover his activity of organizing shows for consideration
> which provide entertainment to the connoisseurs. For each show he plans and
> creates events based on his skill, experience and training. In each show he
> undertakes an activity which is commercial and which he places before his
> audience for its consumption. The tax on service is levied for each show.
> This situation is very similar to a situation where goods are manufactured
> or produced with the intention of being cleared for home consumption under
> the Central Excise Act, 1944. This is how the principle of equivalence
> equates consumption of goods with consumption of services as both satisfy
> the human needs. In the case of internet service provider, service tax is
> leviable for online information and database provided by websites. But no
> service tax is leviable on e-commerce as there is no database access.

> 25\. On the basis of the above discussion, it is clear that service tax is
> VAT which in turn is both a general tax as well as destination based
> consumption tax leviable on services provided within the country."

After so stating, their Lordships proceeded to advert to the meaning of the
words "taxes on professions" and held as follows:

> "34. As stated above, Entry 60, List II refers to taxes on professions, etc.
> It is the tax on the individual person/firm or company. It is the tax on the
> status. A chartered accountant or a cost WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
> matters Page 72 of 100 accountant obtains a licence or a privilege from the
> competent body to practice. On that privilege as such the State is competent
> to levy a tax under Entry 60. However, as stated above, Entry 60 is not a
> general entry. It cannot be read to include every activity undertaken by a
> chartered accountant/cost accountant/architect for consideration. Service
> tax is a tax on each activity undertaken by a chartered accountant/cost
> accountant or an architect. The cost accountant/chartered
> accountant/architect charges his client for advice or for auditing of
> accounts. Similarly, a cost accountant charges his client for advice as well
> as doing the work of costing. For each transaction or contract, the
> chartered accountant/cost accountant renders profession based services. The
> activity undertaken by the chartered accountant or the cost accountant or an
> architect has two aspects. From the point of view of the chartered
> accountant/cost accountant it is an activity undertaken by him based on his
> performance and skill. But from the point of view of his client, the
> chartered accountant/cost accountant is his service provider. It is a tax on
> "services". The activity undertaken by the chartered accountant or cost
> accountant is similar to saleable or marketable commodities produced by the
> assessee and cleared by the assessee for home consumption under the Central
> Excise Act.

> 35\. For each contract, tax is levied under the Finance Acts, 1994 and 1998.
> Tax cannot be levied under that Act without service being provided whereas a
> professional tax under Entry 60 is a tax on his status. It is the tax on the
> status of a cost accountant or a chartered accountant. As long as a
> person/firm remains in the profession, he/it has to pay professional tax.
> That tax has nothing to do with the commercial activities which he
> undertakes WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 73 of 100 for his
> client. Even if the chartered accountant has no work throughout the
> accounting year, still he has to pay professional tax. He has to pay the tax
> till he remains in the profession. This is the ambit and scope of Entry 60,
> List II which is a taxing entry. Therefore, Entry 60 contemplates tax on
> professions, as such. Entry 60, List II refers to "tax on employments".

> xxx xxx xxx

> 39\. It was further observed that a lawyer has to pay tax to take out a
> licence irrespective of whether he actually practices or not. That tax is a
> tax for the privilege of having the right to exercise the profession if and
> when the person taking out the licence chooses to do so. It was held that

Eventually, it has been held in the said case that the tax on services do not
fall under Entry 60, List II and the service would fall under Entry 92-C/97 of
List I. Be it noted, it has been held therein that service tax is a value
added tax and the value addition is on account of activities like planning,
consultation, advising, etc. It is an activity which provides value addition
as in the case of manufacture of goods which attracts excise duty. Their
Lordships, in the said case, opined that the tax falls on the activity which
is the subject matter of service tax, if the word "service" is to be
substituted in the place of goods by applying the principle of equivalence.

51\. In Association of Leasing and Financial Service Companies (supra), while
dealing with the validity of Sections 65(12) and 65(105)(zm) of the Finance
Act, 1994 as amended which pertain to the levy of service tax on leasing and
hire-purchase, the Apex Court, after referring to the decisions in D.H.
Hazareth (supra), Ujagar Prints (II) v. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 488,
International Tourist WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 75 of 100
Corporation (supra) and Goodricke Group Ltd.(supra), has held thus:

> "59. Applying the above decisions to the present case, on examination of the
> impugned legislation in its entirety, we are of the view that the impugned
> levy relates to or is with respect to the particular topic of "banking and
> other financial services" which includes within it one of the several
> enumerated services viz. financial leasing services. These include long-term
> financing by banks and other financial institutions (including NBFCs). These
> are services rendered to their customers which comes within the meaning of
> the expression "taxable services" as defined in Section 65(105)(zm). The
> taxable event under the impugned law is the rendition of service. The
> impugned tax is not on material or sale. It is on activity/service rendered
> by the service provider to its customer. Equipment leasing/hire-purchase
> finance are long- term financing activities undertaken as their business by
> NBFCs. As far as the taxable value in case of financial leasing including
> equipment leasing and hire purchase is concerned, the amount received as
> principal is not the consideration for services rendered. Such amount is
> credited to the capital account of the lessor/hire-purchase service
> provider. It is the interest/finance charge which is treated as income or
> revenue and which is credited to the revenue account. Such interest or
> finance charges together with the lease management fee/processing
> fee/documentation charges are treated as considerations for the services
> rendered and accordingly they constitute the value of taxable services on
> which service tax is made payable."

52\. From the aforesaid pronouncements in the field, the following principles
regarding service tax can be fruitfully culled out: WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 76 of 100

(i) The measure of taxation does not affect the nature of taxation and,
therefore, the manner of quantification of the levy of service tax has no
bearing on the factum of legislative competence.

(ii) Taxable services can include providing of premises on a temporary basis
for organizing any official, social or business function but also other
facilities supplied in relation thereto.

(iii) Levy of service tax on a particular kind of service cannot be struck
down on the ground that it does not conform to a common understanding of the
word „service‟ as long as it does not transgress any specific restriction
embodied in the Constitution.

(iv) Service tax is a levy on the event of service.

(v) The concept of service tax is an economic concept.

(vi) „Consumption of service‟ as in case of „consumption of goods‟ satisfies
human needs.

(vii) Service tax is a value added tax which, in turn, is a general tax
applicable to all commercial activities involving provision of service.

WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 77 of 100

(viii) Value added tax is a general tax as well as destination based
consumption tax leviable on services provided within the country.

(ix) The principle of equivalence is in-built into the concept of service tax.

(x) The activity undertaken in a transaction can have two components, namely,
activity undertaken by a person pertaining to his performance and skill and,
secondly the person who avails the benefit of the said performance and skill.
In the said context, the two concepts, namely, activity and the service
provider and service recipient gain significance.

53\. Having enumerated the principles relating to the fields of legislation,
the situations and circumstances when a levy on tax on land comes under Entry
49 of List II and what in conceptual essentiality covers the facet of service
tax, it is presently seemly to dwell upon the three major submissions which
have been astutely canvassed in different ways by the learned counsel at the
Bar. What is contended by them is that renting and leasing is basically
associated with the land WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 78 of
100 and putting any kind of unnecessary impact on the same would not make it a
tax on any activity to bring it with the purview of Entry 97 of List I of the
Constitution. It is urged that it is the duty of the court to broadly
interpret the entries of the field and effort has to be made to see that the
Parliament, pursuant to the residuary powers vested in it, does not trench
upon the powers of the State Legislature especially in the case of a taxable
event pertaining to the object which is covered within Entry 49 of List II. In
essence, the proponement is that into the field of State legislation under
List II, a free entry of Entry 97 of List I should not be allowed. That apart,
it is submitted that the concept of service tax has been evolved by the courts
of law by attaching value addition to it and in the absence of any value
addition in renting, leasing and licensing or any aspect in that regard, if
the same brought under the net of service tax, a constitutional amendment is
required and it is not permissible to bring it in by statutory amendment as
has been done by the Finance Act, 2010. The seminal submission is that there
is no value addition and, therefore, the service tax is not imposable. Per-
contra, the learned Additional Solicitor General would submit that once a levy
of tax does not fall under List II or List III, it would fall in WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 79 of 100 List I, regard being had to
the amplitude of the residuary power that has been provided in the
Constitution under Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution. In this regard, we may note with profit certain authorities in
the field.

54\. In International Tourist Corporation (supra), it has been held that
before exclusive legislative competence can be claimed by the Parliament by
resort to the residuary power, the legislative incompetence of the State
legislature must be clearly established. Entry 97 itself is specific in that a
matter can be brought under that Entry only if it is not enumerated in List II
or List III and in the case of a tax if it is not mentioned in either of those
Lists. In a Federal Constitution like ours, where there is a division of
legislative subjects but the residuary power is vested in the Parliament, such
residuary power cannot be so expansively interpreted as to whittle down the
power of the State Legislature. That might affect and jeopardize the very
federal principle. The federal nature of the Constitution demands that an
interpretation which would allow the exercise of legislative power by the
Parliament pursuant to the residuary powers vested in it to trench upon the
State legislation and which would thereby destroy or WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 80 of 100 belittle state autonomy must be rejected. In
the said case, it has been further opined that where the competing entries are
an entry in List II and Entry 97 of List I, the entry in the State List must
be given a broad and plentiful interpretation.

55\. In Harbhajan Singh Dhillon (supra), it has been held thus:

> "59. It was also said that if this was the intention of the Constitution
> makers they need not have formulated List I at all. This is the point which
> was taken by Sardar Hukam Singh and others in the debates referred to above
> and was answered by Dr. Ambedkar. But apart from what has been stated by Dr.

> to us that in this context; if a Central Act is challenged, as being beyond
> the legislative competence of Parliament, it is enough if it is a law with
> respect to matters or taxes enumerated in List II. If it is not, no further
> question arises."

56\. In State of Karnataka v. Union of India & Anr., AIR 1978 SC 68, it has
been held thus:

> "96. It will be seen that the test adopted in Dhillon‟s case (supra) was
> that if a subject does not WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 81
> of 100 fall within a specifically demarcated field found in List II or List
> III it would fall in List I apparently because the amplitude of the

> denote fields of operation of legislative power which is actually conferred
> by one of the articles of the Constitution. It was pointed out that Art. 248
> of the Constitution conferring legislative power is "framed in the widest
> possible terms." The validity of the Wealth Tax Act was upheld in that case.
> The argument that a wide range given to Entry 97 of List I, read with Art.

> to the Central Government by Section 3 of the Act, now before us, could not
> be held to be invalid on the ground that federal structure of the State is
> jeopardized by the view we are adopting in conformity with the previous
> decisions of this Court."

57\. In M/s. Sat Pal and Co. etc., v. Lt. Governor of Delhi and others, AIR
1979 SC 1550, while dealing with the challenge to legislative competence, it
has been held thus:

> "Whenever legislative competence is in question attempt of the Courts is to
> find out whether the legislation squarely falls in one or the other entry.
> If a particular legislation is covered by any specific entry well and would
> be : is it beyond the legislative competence of Parliament? In undertaking
> this exercise it is quite often known that a legislation may be covered by
> more than one entry because an analysis has shown that the entries are
> overlapping. If the legislation may fall in one entry partly and part of it
> may be covered by the WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 82 of
> 100 residuary entry, the legislation would nonetheless be immune from the
> attack on the ground of legislative competence."

After so stating, their Lordships proceeded to state that with the advancement
of society, expanding horizons of scientific and technical knowledge, probe
into the mystery of creation, it is impossible to conceive that every
imaginable head of legislation within human comprehension and within the
foreseeable future could have been within the contemplation of the founding
fathers and was, therefore, specifically enumerated in one or the other of the
three Lists, meaning thereby that the three Lists were exhaustive of
Governmental action and activity. Elaborating further, their Lordships stated
that the demands of the welfare State, hopes and aspirations and expectations
in a developing society and the complex world situation with inter- dependence
and hostility amongst nations may necessitate legislation on some such topics
which may be inconceivable even for visionaries and, hence, could not have
been within the contemplation of the founding fathers. Complex modern
governmental administration in a federal set up providing distribution of
legislative powers coupled with the power of judicial review may raise such
situations that a subject of WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 83
of 100 legislation may not squarely fall in any specific entry in Lists I or
III. Upon proper appraisal of the aforesaid, their Lordships finally opined
that it may not be covered by any entry in List II, though apparently or on a
superficial view it may be covered by an entry in List II. In such a
situation, the Parliament would have the power to legislate on the subject in
exercise of the residuary power under Entry 97, List I and it would not be
proper to unduly circumscribe, corrode or whittle down this power by saying
that the subject of legislation was present to the mind of the framers of the
Constitution because apparently it falls in one of the entries in List II and
thereby deny power to legislate under Entry 97.

58\. In Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. (supra), it has been held thus-

> "46. Therefore, taxing entries must be construed with clarity and precision
> so as to maintain such exclusivity, and a construction of a taxation entry
> which may lead to overlapping must be eschewed. If the taxing power is
> within a particular legislative field it would follow that other fields in
> the legislative lists must be construed to exclude this field so that there
> is no possibility of legislative trespass.

Further, with respect to the exclusive legislative powers of the Parliament
and the States, their Lordships have held thus: WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 84 of 100

> "49. Under the three lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Indian
> Constitution a taxation entry in a legislative list may be with respect to
> an object or an event or may be with respect to both. Article 246 makes it
> clear that the exclusive powers conferred on the Parliament or the States to
> legislate on a particular matter includes the power to legislate with
> respect to that matter. Hence, where the entry describes an object of tax,
> all taxable events pertaining to the object are within that field of
> legislation unless the event is specifically provided for elsewhere under a
> different legislative head. Where there is the possibility of legislative
> overlap, courts have resolved the issue according to settled principles of
> construction of entries in the legislative lists."

59\. In Federation of Hotel & Restaurant v. Union of India and others, AIR
1990 SC 1637, it has been held that the question of legislative practice as to
what a particular legislative entry could be held to embrace is inapposite
while dealing with a tax which is sui generis or non-descript imposed in
exercise of the residuary powers so long as such tax is not specifically
enumerated in Lists II and III.

60\. As the tabular chart that we have reproduced would clearly show, Section
65 is the provision which deals with the charging of service tax. Section
66(105) defines taxable service to mean any service provided or to be provided
to any person, by any other person by renting immovable property or any other
service in relation to such WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 85
of 100 renting for use in the course of or furtherance of business or
commerce. Section 65(90a) has been amended in 2010 to mean renting of
immovable property which includes renting, letting, leasing, licensing or
other similar arrangements of immovable property for use in the course or
furtherance of business or commerce but does not include certain aspects.
Explanation No.1 to the said provision provides that "for use in the course or
furtherance of business or commerce" includes the use of immovable property as
factories, office buildings, warehouses, theatres, exhibition halls and
multiple-use buildings. Explanation 2 further declares that for the purposes
of this said clause, renting of immovable property would include allowing or
permitting the use of space in an immovable property, irrespective of the
transfer of possession or control of the said immovable property. The earlier
provision had introduced the definition of renting of immovable property
including renting, letting, leasing, licensing or other similar arrangements
in the course or furtherance of business or commerce.

61\. In the first Home Solution case, the Division Bench had posed the
question whether the renting of immovable property for use in the course of or
furtherance of business or commerce by itself is service. WP(C) No.3398/2010
with connected matters Page 86 of 100 The Bench referred to Section
65(105)(zzzz) as it stood then and opined that it was unable to discern any
value addition and, hence, the renting of immovable property for use in the
course or furtherance of business or commerce by itself does not entail any
value addition and, therefore, cannot be regarded as service. Because of the
said view, the circular was quashed. Be it noted, in the said decision, the
Bench has not appositely adverted to Section 65(90a) which clearly postulated
that renting of immovable property includes renting, letting, leasing,
licensing or other similar arrangements for use in the course or furtherance
of business or commerce barring certain exceptions. In Section 66(105)(zzzz),
the taxable service was defined to mean any service provided to any person by
any other person relating to the renting of immovable property for use in the
course of or furtherance of business or commerce. The Parliament, by
amendment, has differently positioned the words "in relation to". As we
perceive, the Division Bench has laid down that the mere renting of immovable
property for use in the course of or furtherance of business or commerce by
itself could not entail any value addition. If the definition in Section
65(90a) is taken into consideration, there is a WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 87 of 100 deeming concept with regard to service and
the taxable service is based or founded on renting of immovable property. The
learned senior counsel for the petitioner would contend that the Parliament
cannot, by deeming fiction, create a tax liability to bring it within the
purview of Entry 97 of List I as that would be an indirect entrenchment on
Entry 49 of List II. Per-contra, Mr. Chandhiok, relying on the decision in
Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Assn. (supra), submits that the concept of
service, as is understood by a layman, is not applicable to the concept of
taxing statute under the constitutional framework. He would further contend
that once this Court holds that the levy does not pertain to a tax on land or
building but an activity like renting, leasing, licensing or other similar
arrangements of immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of
business or commerce, it would come within the residuary power of the
Parliament and the same should put the controversy to rest.

62\. As presently advised, we shall dwell upon the concept of value addition.
The hub of the matter is when a premise is let out for use, should a person
who rents an immovable property or renders any other WP(C) No.3398/2010 with
connected matters Page 88 of 100 service in relation to such letting for use
in the course or furtherance of business or commerce be liable to service tax.

63\. The Division Bench in the first Home Solution case (supra), as we have
reproduced hereinbefore, has opined that renting of immovable property for use
in the course or furtherance of business or commerce by itself would not
constitute service as there is no value addition. In the dictionary clause in
Section 65(90A), while defining renting of immovable property, it has been
stated that it includes renting, letting, leasing, licencing or other similar
arrangements for immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of
business or commerce. On a perusal of the decision in the first Home Solution
case (supra), it is discernible that the Division Bench has not appositely
adverted to the same. The contention that despite the amendment when the value
addition as a concept is not attracted to renting, letting, leasing and
licencing even for commercial purpose, the ingredients of service tax are not
satisfied is not well founded. In this context, it is to be appreciated that
the concept of service, as is understood in common parlance or common
understanding, would not be a factor to hold a provision as unconstitutional.
We need not advert WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 89 of 100 to
whether the Parliament has, by using of the definition, created a fiction. The
terms which are significant are renting, letting, leasing and licencing for
use in the course or furtherance of business or commerce. The legislature has
not merely said renting of immovable property. It has used the terminology
renting of property or any service in relation to such renting and that too in
the course or furtherance of business or commerce, the last part being
important. While understanding the concept of service tax, it is to be kept in
mind that it is both a general tax as well as a destination based consumption
tax levied on services. Sometimes services can be "property based services"
and "performance based services". The architects, interior designers and real
estate agents would come in the category of performance service providers.

64\. It is contended that when a property is leased or rented, the element of
service is absolutely absent. In this context, the concept of rent has to be
appositely understood. A rent is basically a reward paid for the use of the
land. The tenant or the occupant pays the same to use the premises. In the
economic concept, rent can be categorized into two heads, namely, contract
rent and economic rent. Contract rent WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 90 of 100 fundamentally refers to the total amount of money paid
for use of the land and economic rent is a part of the total payment which is
made for the use of land and it is estimated on many a ground. The economic
rent can be contract rent minus interest on the capital invested. To give an
example, a tenant pays Rs.20,000/- per year as contract rent but the interest
on capital invested is Rs.3,000/- per year. Thus, the remaining amount, that
is, Rs.17,000/- (Rs.20,000.00 - Rs.3,000.00) is paid for the use of the land.

65\. The concept of economic rent can also represent an amount which a factor
can earn in its next best alternative use. To give an example, a piece of land
yields in a particular use Rs.5,000 in a year. If it is transferred to its
next best use, it can earn a better income. At one point of time, the Theory
of Rent was propagated by David Ricardo. According to the Ricardian theory,
rent has differential surplus and the same arises due to certain facets
relating to fertility, productivity, extensive cultivation, quality, etc.
Ricardo fundamentally considered rent as a surplus accruing to superior land
over inferior land called "marginal land". It also depended upon shifting of
population. Be it noted, the rent varies depending upon advantages. To give an
WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 91 of 100 example, two decades
back, a market is established in zone „A‟, thereafter, a railway station
starts in another zone called „B‟. The cost of a particular item on being
transported from zone „A‟ to outside the city will cost more than the articles
transported from zone „B‟. Compared to zones „A‟ and „B‟, if there are other
zones which are farther away like zones „C‟ and „D‟, they will be less
advantageous. Thus, the lands or buildings located in zones „A‟ and „B‟ would
be more advantageous. The value difference comes into play because of
transport charges. The surplus arises because of the location and availability
of facilities. Appreciated in this context, economic rent is a surplus which
arises on account of natural differential advantages and can be treated as
„service‟. That apart, scarcity of premises, the pressure of demand and the
increase of population are also contributory factors. Consequently, any land
or building situated in a particular place does possess certain inherent
qualities which distinguishes it from land or building at other places. The
factors which really weigh are location, accessibility, goodwill, construction
quality and other advantages. A land or building in one area may fetch more
rent than in another area. When a particular building is rented or WP(C)
No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 92 of 100 leased or given under
arrangement for commercial or business purposes, many factors are taken into
consideration. Every building or premises cannot be utilized for commercial or
business purposes. When a particular building or premises has the "effect
potentiality" to be let out on rent for the said purpose, an element of
service is involved in the immovable property and that tantamounts to value
addition which would come within the component of service tax. To further
clarify, an element of service arises because a person who intends to avail
the property on rent wishes to use it for a specific purpose. The value of the
building gets accentuated because of scarcity of land or building, goodwill,
accessibility and similar ancillary advantages which constitute value
addition.

66\. The modern economic theory of rent also has a nexus with demand and
supply. In this analysis, rental is hiked because supply of land is scarce in
relation to its demand. This economic concept is called "scarcity theory of
rent". This includes the facet of competition and quality. According to the
modern theory, rent is not peculiar to land alone but arises in the case of
many a factor which earn over and above the transfer earnings. There is a
distinction between "actual WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 93
of 100 earnings" and "transfer earnings". According to the modern analysis of
rent, it is not peculiar to land alone and the concept of transfer earning is
more attracted towards the building depending upon its use. As an economic
concept, it has been developed that rent qua building or premises or, for that
matter, land has a nexus, an inseparable one, with the potentiality of its use
in a competitive market. The economic growth has an effect on rent. In this
regard, modern economists have evolved certain methods, namely, technical
progress in methods of production, development in means of transportation and
population growth. We have referred to these concepts only to highlight that
the legislature has not imposed tax on mere letting but associated it with
business or commercial use. Thus, it comes within the concept of activity and
the value addition is inherent. It is worth noting that the language employed
in the dictionary clause and the charging section, that is, "commercial use
for business purposes" have their own significance. In Black‟s law dictionary,
"commercial" has been defined as "relates to or is connected with trade and
traffic or commerce in general; is occupied with business and commerce". In
R.M. Investment and Trading Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Boeing Co. and WP(C) No.3398/2010
with connected matters Page 94 of 100 another, (1994) 4 SCC 541, while dealing
with the expression "commercial" it has been opined that the expression
"commercial" should be construed broadly having regard to the manifold
activities which are integral part of international trade today.

67\. In Stroud‟s judicial dictionary (5th Edition), the term „commercial‟ is
defined as traffic, trade or merchandize in buying and selling of goods.

68\. When premises is taken for commercial purpose, it is basically to
subserve the cause of facilitating commerce, business and promoting the same.
Therefore, there can be no trace of doubt that an element of value addition is
involved and once there is a value addition, there is an element of service.

69\. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we are disposed to think that the
imposition of service tax under Section 65(105)(zzzz) read with Section 66 is
not a tax on land and building which is under Entry 49 of List II. What is
being taxed is an activity, and the activity denotes the letting or leasing
with a purpose, and the purpose is fundamentally for commercial or business
purpose and its furtherance. The concept has WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 95 of 100 to be read in conjunction. As we have explained that
service tax is associated with value addition as evolved by the judgments of
the Apex Court, the submission that the base of the said decisions cannot be
taken away by a statutory amendment need not be adverted to. Once there is a
value addition and the element of service is involved, in conceptual
essentiality, service tax gets attracted and the impost gets out of the
purview of Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and
falls under the residuary entry, that is, Entry 97 of List I.

70\. In view of our conclusion, the decision in the first Home Solution case
does not lay down the law correctly inasmuch as in the said decision, it has
been categorically laid down that even if a building/land is let out for
commercial or business purposes, there is no value addition. Being of this
view, we overrule the said decision.

71\. The next limb of attack is with regard to the retrospective applicability
of the provision. The learned counsel for the petitioners have submitted that
the tax and the penalty could not have been imposed with retrospective effect.
It is worth noting that the Parliament, keeping in view the first Home
Solution case, substituted WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected matters Page 96
of 100 sub-clause (zzzz) in the present incarnation and gave retrospective
effect to cure the deficiency. It is well settled in law that it is open to
the legislature to pass a legislation retrospectively and remove the base on
which a judgment is delivered. The said view has been stated in Bakhtawar
Trust and others v. M.D. Narayan and others, (2003) 5 SCC 298. In the said
case, in paragraphs 20 and 26, it has been held thus:

> "20. In Vijay Mills Company Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Gujarat and Ors.,
> (1993) 1 SCC 345, it was held-

> "18. From the above, it is clear that there are different modes of
> validating the provisions of the Act retrospectively, depending upon the
> intention of the legislature in that behalf. Where the Legislature intends
> that the provisions of the Act themselves should be deemed to have been in
> existence from a particular date in the past and thus to validate the
> actions taken in the past as if the provisions concerned were in existence
> from the earlier date, the Legislature makes the said intention clear by the
> specific language of the validating Act. It is open for the legislature to

73\. On the question of penalty due to non-payment of tax, it is open to the
government to examine whether any waiver or exemption can be granted. It may
be noted that the appeal against Home Solutions-I is pending before the
Supreme Court but the operation of the said judgment has not been stayed.

74\. Quite apart from the above, as we have overruled the first Home Solution
case, we are disposed to think that the provisions would operate from 2007 and
the amendment brought by the Parliament is by way of ex abundanti cautela.

75\. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we proceed to enumerate our
conclusions in seriatim as follows:

(a) The provisions, namely, Section 65(105)(zzzz) and Section 66 of the
Finance Act, 1994 and as amended by the Finance Act, 2010, are intra vires the
Constitution of India.

(b) The decision rendered in the first Home Solution case does not lay down
the correct law as we have held that there is value addition when the premises
is let out for use in the course of or WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 99 of 100 furtherance of business or commerce and it is,
accordingly overruled.

(c) The challenge to the amendment giving it retrospective effect is
unsustainable and, accordingly, the same stands repelled and the retrospective
amendment is declared as constitutionally valid.

76\. Consequently, the writ petitions, being sans substratum, stand dismissed
without any order as to costs.
