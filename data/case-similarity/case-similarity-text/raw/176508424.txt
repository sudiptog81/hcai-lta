    1.            This is a suit filed by the plaintiff company/M/s Foundary
    
    Visionmongers Ltd. By the suit, the plaintiff seeks reliefs of permanent
    
    injunction etc with respect to the cause of action averred by the plaintiff in
    
    the plaint pertaining to infringement by the defendants of the Copyright of
    
    
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                              Page 1 of 18
     the plaintiff in plaintiff's various software programs with the principal
    
    program being 'NUKE'. The software programs of the plaintiff are used
    
    with respect to picture film, animation, commercials, and broadcast post-
    
    production. As per the suit plaint, the defendants are violating the Copyright
    
    of the plaintiff by using the software programs without obtaining the
    
    requisite licence from the plaintiff.
    
    
    2.            There are two defendants in the suit and addresses of both the
    
    defendants are of Hyderabad. Defendant no.1 is an individual and defendant
    
    no.1 is said to be carrying on its business in the name of the defendant no.2.
    
    Plaintiff has filed the suit claiming existence of territorial jurisdiction of the
    
    courts at Delhi in terms of averments of paras 1 and 6 of the plaint that
    
    plaintiff is carrying on business in Delhi because plaintiff has its exclusive
    
    reseller (i.e dealer) in Delhi. Paras 1 and 6 of the plaint read as under:-
    
         "1. The Plaintiff, The Foundry Visionmongers Ltd is a company
         registered under the laws of England of Wales having its registered office
         at 5 Golden Square Golden Square London W1F 9HT United Kingdom,
         The Plaintiff is carrying on business of marketing, selling and supporting
         services in India through its exclusive reseller ARK Infosolutions Pvt.
         Ltd. having its registered office located at 4428, Ganesh Bazaar, Cloth
         market, New Delhi - 110006. Col. J K Sharma (Retd.) is the duly
         authorized signatory of the Plaintiff and is competent to sign verify and
         institute the present proceedings. A copy of the Power of Attorney as
         executed in favour of Col. J K Sharma by the plaintiff has been filed in
         the present proceedings and may be kindly referred to.
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                                 Page 2 of 18
                                              xxxxx
                                             xxxxx
           6.     In India, Plaintiff carries on business through its exclusive
           reseller, ARK Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd (hereinafter ARK Info) having its
           registered office located at 4428, Ganesh Bazar, Cloth Market, Delhi-
           110006. ARK Info is the Plaintiffs exclusive reseller in the territory
           of India for the software program NUKE (including its various
           editions and versions). ARK Info Provides services of marketing
           promotion, training on the software programs for the customers, sale
           of software licenses of the Plaintiff as well as supporting the
           maintenance services of the Plaintiff. For its services, ARK Info is
           entitled to a commission on ever sale of software license or sale of
           maintenance services thereof. "
    
    
    3.            As per the territorial jurisdiction; para 33 of the plaint, this
    
    Court has territorial jurisdiction because of Section 62(2) of the Copyright
    
    Act, 1957 and because the plaintiff is carrying on business in Delhi. This
    
    para 33 of the plaint pertaining to territorial jurisdiction reads as under:-
    
                                    "JURISDICTION
           33.          This Hon'ble court has jurisdiction to entertain and try
           the present Suit by virtue of Section 62 (2) of the Copyright Act, 1957
           as the Plaintiff carries on its business for profit and gains in Delhi
           through its authorized reseller ARK Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd. who offer
           the whole range of the plaintiff's products and services. Amongst the
           several ways in which the Plaintiff carries on business are the
           following, though the list is not comprehensive and the Plaintiffs
           crave leave to rely on additional evidence at a later stage of the
           proceeding:
           i.   Through the distributor of Plaintiff which is located at 4428,
           Ganesh Bazaar, Cloth Market, New Delhi - 110006 to provide
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                                 Page 3 of 18
            marketing, demonstration of the Foundry solutions, technical support
           and channel sales management.
           ii.    Through a host of other activities as enumerated in para 6
           hereinabove which constitute and contribute in one-way or the other
           to the Plaintiffs' business thereby clothing this Hon'ble court with the
           necessary jurisdiction to entertain the present suit in terms of the
           guidelines laid down in the Supreme Court judgments in Dodha
           House vs. SK Mangi [2006 (9) SCC 41] and Indian Performing Rights
           Society Ltd. vs Sanjay Dalia [Civil Appeal No. 10643-44 of 2010]
           The Plaintiffs crave leave to refer to and rely upon detailed particulars
           and evidence in support of these."
    
    4.            The issue before this Court is that whether this Court has
    
    territorial jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit.
    
    
    5.            Territorial jurisdiction of a court exists in a case such as the
    
    present either by virtue of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
    
    (CPC) or on account of Section 62 of the Copyright Act. For the sake of
    
    convenience these two provisions are reproduced below:
    
            Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
            "Section 20. - Other suits to be instituted where defendants
            reside or cause of action arises. - Subject to the limitations
            aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local
            limits of whose jurisdiction -
                   (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are
            more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit,
            actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or
            personally works for gain; or
                   (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at
            the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                                  Page 4 of 18
             resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain,
            provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or
            the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or
            personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution;
            or
                   (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.
                    Explanation. - A corporation shall be deemed to carry on
            business at its sole or principal office in India or, in respect of any
            cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate
            office, at such place."
    
    
           Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957
            "62. Jurisdiction of court over matters arising under this
            Chapter. -- (1) Every suit or other civil proceeding arising under
            this Chapter in respect of the infringement of copyright in any work
            or the infringement of any other right conferred by this Act shall be
            instituted in the district court having jurisdiction.
            (2) For the purpose of sub-section (1), a "district court having
            jurisdiction" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
            of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), or any other law for the time
            being in force, include a district court within the local limits of
            whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other
            proceeding, the person instituting the suit or other proceeding or,
            where there are more than one such persons, any of them actually
            and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works
            for gain."                                       (underlining added)
    
    
    6.            In an ordinary civil suit, territorial jurisdiction of a court arises
    
    either because of residence of the defendant within the territorial jurisdiction
    
    of the court or because of arising of whole or part of the cause of action
    
    within the territorial jurisdiction of the court or on account of the defendant
    
    carrying on business at a particular place within the territorial jurisdiction of
    
    the court.     So far as a corporation or a company is concerned, the
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                                    Page 5 of 18
     Explanation to Section 20 CPC brings out a deeming provision that when the
    
    expression "carrying on business" is found in Section 20 CPC, then such
    
    expression of "carrying on business" with respect to a corporation has
    
    necessarily to be linked with respect to the carrying on business by the
    
    corporation by its principal office or a sole office or a subordinate office and
    
    that it is because of existence of any such office that the cause of action
    
    arises by the company/corporation carrying on its business through any such
    
    office. Putting it in other words, carrying on business by a corporation, in
    
    view of Explanation to Section 20 CPC, is not seen dehors existence of an
    
    office of a corporation but that the carrying on business is inextricably
    
    linked to existence of an office whether the office is a principal office or a
    
    sole office or a registered office or a subordinate office. This aspect will
    
    also become clear from the observations of the Supreme Court in the
    
    judgment in the case of Dhodha House & Patel Field Marshal Industries
    
    Vs. S.K. Maingi & P.M. Diesel Ltd. 2006 (32) PTC 1 (SC) and in which
    
    judgment the Supreme Court has referred to its earlier judgment in the case
    
    of Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund Vs. Kartick Das, (1994) 4 SCC 225, and
    
    which aspect is discussed in detail below.
    
    
    7.            On behalf of the plaintiff, it is strenuously argued that this
    
    CS(OS) No. 2660/2015                                               Page 6 of 18
     Court at this stage of the suit coming up for admission must take the
    
    contents of paras 1 and 6 of the plaint as true and once these contents of
    
    paras 1 and 6 are taken as true, the plaintiff is clearly carrying on business at
    
    Delhi because plaintiff has an exclusive reseller or dealer/distributor in
    
    Delhi. Leaned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff in this regard places very
    
    strong reliance on paras 48 to 50 of the judgment in the case of Dhodha
    
    House (supra) and these paras read as under:-
    
      "48. In Dhodha House (supra), admittedly the plaintiff-Appellant neither
      resided at Ghaziabad nor carried on any business at the place of residence of the
      respondent. In Patel Field Marshal (supra), the registered office of the

plaintiff-firm was at Rajkot. Ordinarily, the residence of a company would be
where registered office is [See Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das,
(1994)4SCC225].

49\. The expression 'carries on business' and the expression 'personally works
for gain' connotes two different meanings. For the purpose of carrying on
business only presence of a man at a place is not necessary. Such business may
be carried at a place through an agent or a manager or through a servant. The
owner may not event visit that place. The phrase 'carries on business" at a
certain place would, therefore, mean having an interest in a business at that
place, a voice in what is done, a share in the gain or loss and some control
there over. The expression is much wider than what the expression in normal
parlance connotes, because of the ambit of a civil action within the meaning
of section 9 of the Code. But it is necessary that the following three
conditions should be satisfied, namely:-

> "(1) The agent must be a special agent who attends exclusively to the
> business of the principal and carries it on in the name of the principal and
> not a general agent who does business for any one that pays him. Thus, a
> trader in the mufassil who habitually sends grain to Madras for sale by a
> firm of commission agents who have an independent business of selling goods
> for others on commission, cannot be said to "carry on business" in Madras.
> So a firm in England, carrying on business in the name of A.B. & Co., which
> employs upon the usual terms a Bombay firm carrying on business in the name
> of C.D. & Co., to act as the English firm's commission agents in Bombay,
> does CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 7 of 18 not "carry on business" in Bombay so
> as to render itself liable to be sued in Bombay.

> (2) The person acting as agent must be an agent in the strict sense of the
> term. The manager of a joint Hindu family is not an "agent" within the
> meaning of this condition.

> (3) To constitute "carrying on business" at a certain place, the essential
> part of the business must take place in that place. therefore, a retail
> dealer who sells goods in the mufassil cannot be said to "carry on business"
> in Bombay merely because he has an agent in Bombay to import and purchase
> his stock for him. He cannot be said to carry on business in Bombay unless
> his agent made sales there on his behalf. A Calcutta firm that employs an
> agent at Amritsar who has no power to receive money or to enter into
> contracts, but only collects orders which are forwarded to and dealt with in
> Calcutta, cannot be said to do business in Amritsar. But a Bombay firm that
> has a branch office at Amritsar, where orders are received subject to
> confirmation by the head office at Bombay, and where money is paid and
> disbursed, is carrying on business at Amritsar and is liable to be sued at
> Amritsar. Similarly a Life Assurance Company which carries on business in
> Bombay and employs an agent at Madras who acts merely as a Post Office
> forwarding proposals and sending moneys cannot be said to do business in
> Madras. Where a contract of insurance was made at place A and the insurance
> amount was also payable there, a suit filed at place B where the insurance
> Co. had a branch office was held not maintainable. Where the plaintiff
> instituted a suit at Kozhikode alleging that its account with the defendant
> Bank at its Calcutta branch had been wrongly debited and it was claimed that
> that court had jurisdiction as the defendant had a branch there, it was held
> that the existence of a branch was not part of the cause of action and that
> the Kozhikode Court therefore had no jurisdiction. But when a company
> through incorporated outside India gets itself registered in India and does
> business in a place in India through its agent authorized to accept
> insurance proposals, and to pay claims, and to do other business incidental
> to the work of agency, the company carries on business at the place of
> business in India."

[See Mulla on the Code of Civil Procedure (Act V of 1908) - Fifteenth Edition
- Volume I, Pages 246-247.]

50\. A corporation in view of Explanation appended to Section 20 of the Code
would be deemed to be carrying on business inter alia at a place where it has
a subordinate office. Only because, its goods are being sold at a place would
thus evidently not mean that it carries a business at that place."

(emphasis is of this Court) CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 8 of 18

8\. During the course of arguments, certain paragraphs of the recent judgment
of the Supreme Court in the case of Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. Vs.
Sanjay Dalia & Anr. 2015 (7) SCALE 574 were also referred to on behalf of the
plaintiff to argue existence of territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

9\. The neat issue before this Court is that whether plaintiff which is a
company/corporation can be said to be carrying on business in Delhi simply on
account of the fact that the plaintiff has an exclusive reseller in Delhi and
which exclusive reseller of the plaintiff sells plaintiff's products in India
and services the products of the plaintiff which are sold. I may note that
there is no dispute that neither whole or even a part of the cause of action
has not accrued in Delhi and this is because the infringement of Copyright
(and which is the cause of action for filing of the suit), is taking place not
at Delhi but at Hyderabad where the defendants are located and are said to be
infringing the Copyright works of the plaintiff. 10(i). One thing is clear
from the reading of paras 1 and 6 of the plaint alongwith para 33 of the
plaint that it is not the case of the plaintiff that the business of the
reseller of the plaintiff in India, M/s ARK Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd. is owned
by the plaintiff. Putting it in other words, the profit and loss CS(OS) No.
2660/2015 Page 9 of 18 of business of the exclusive reseller, M/s ARK
Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd. is not of the plaintiff. Putting it in the words of
the Supreme Court as used in para 49 of Dhodha House's case (supra), plaintiff
has no share in the gain or loss of its exclusive reseller and which is a
separate legal entity than the plaintiff and the plaintiff has no ownership
interest in the exclusive reseller. The exclusive reseller is only the
exclusive agent of the plaintiff and the products of the plaintiff are sold in
India through the exclusive reseller. The exclusive reseller, M/s ARK
Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd. is also not a subsidiary company of the plaintiff
company.

(ii) The question is that whether in such aforesaid facts and circumstances
where the plaintiff sells its products in India through an agent being an
exclusive reseller whether only on account of existence of such an aspect it
is sufficient to hold that the plaintiff carries on business in New Delhi and
thus this Court has territorial jurisdiction.

(iii). In my opinion, the answer to the above question has to be clearly in
the negative and for which purpose the very paragraphs of the judgment of the
Dhodha House's case (supra) which are relied upon by the plaintiff need to be
referred to because the observations in fact do not support the plaintiff but
on the contrary go against the plaintiff. CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 10 of 18
11(i) A reading of para 49 of the judgment in the case of Dhodha House (supra)
makes it clear that carrying on business can only be when a plaintiff which is
a company has an interest in the business which is carried on i.e a share in
the gain or loss AND some control thereof. Obviously control of the business
is alongwith share in the gain and loss and control is not a control of a
principal over an agent and this becomes clear from use of the expression
'and' after 'share in gain or loss' and before the words 'some control there
over'.

(ii) This conclusion also becomes clear when we refer to sub-para 1 of para 49
of Dhodha House's case (supra) and in which sub-para 1 the circumstances which
are identical to this case have been set out. In sub-para 1 of para 49 of
Dhodha House's case (supra) reference is made to the facts of the case where
the firm is in England in the name of A.B. & Co. and which firm employs in
Bombay another firm which carries on business in the name of C.D. & Co., for
the latter firm to act as the English firm's commission agents in Bombay, and
the Supreme Court in such facts held that it cannot be held that the London
firm is carrying on business in Bombay so as to render itself liable to be
sued in Bombay.

12\. Clearly, therefore, existence of a commission agent, i.e the CS(OS) No.
2660/2015 Page 11 of 18 exclusive reseller of the plaintiff, who acts on
behalf of the plaintiff/company which is not registered in India; plaintiff
being the registered company in U.K. and it has no registered office in India
or even a subordinate office for that matter; it cannot in such facts be said
that the plaintiff is carrying on business' in New Delhi. Sub-para 1 of para
49 of Dhoda House's case (supra) therefore clearly shows that as per the facts
of the present case merely because the plaintiff has an exclusive reseller at
Delhi in India, the courts at Delhi would not have territorial jurisdiction.

13\. Learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff argued that when the exclusive
reseller in Delhi sells the goods, the exclusive reseller sells the goods on
commission and plaintiff receives the sale consideration and hence the courts
at Delhi would have territorial jurisdiction, but I cannot agree that this
argument confers territorial jurisdiction to Delhi courts, inasmuch as, sub-
para 1 of para 49 of Dhodha House's case (supra) makes it clear that mere
receipt of sale consideration from a commission agent will not mean that
business of the commission agent will become business of the foreign company
which is not registered in India, once the foreign company does not
participate in the profit/loss of the agent/reseller. Also, the argument urged
on behalf of the plaintiff that the exclusive reseller provides after sale
CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 12 of 18 services and other related services on
behalf of the company and therefore plaintiff company carries on business in
India, is an argument only for being noted to be rejected because once again
the service business is not the business of the plaintiff company in the sense
that plaintiff has any interest in the profit or loss of this business. Once
the exclusive reseller is a totally separate legal entity in which the
plaintiff company has no ownership interest, therefore in such circumstances,
it cannot be said that the business of the exclusive reseller is the business
of the plaintiff company and therefore the plaintiff company is allegedly
carrying on business in Delhi through the exclusive reseller.

14\. I may further note that in sub-para 3 of para 49 of Dhodha House's case
(supra) it is mentioned that only when a company which is incorporated outside
India gets itself registered in India and then does business in that place in
India through its agent, in such circumstances, that court would have
territorial jurisdiction and to apply which condition, a company which is
incorporated outside India has to get itself registered in India. In the
present case, there is no case laid out before this Court that the plaintiff
company which is a registered corporation in U.K has got itself registered in
India. Also as per the facts stated in sub-para 3 of para 49 of CS(OS) No.
2660/2015 Page 13 of 18 Dhodha House's case (supra), the acceptance of the
insurance proposals and payment of claims was only for and on behalf of the
principal and the receipt of insurance proposal and payment of claims was not
as per the ownership rights in such actions/business of the agent.

15\. In my opinion, any doubt in this regard is removed by reference to para
50 of the judgment in the case of Dhodha House (supra) and last line of which
para 50 makes it absolutely and completely clear that merely because goods of
a company are sold at a particular place would not mean that company carries
on business at such place. Therefore, once plaintiff has no registered office
or principal office or a subordinate office in Delhi, Delhi courts would have
no territorial jurisdiction merely because goods of the plaintiff are sold in
Delhi through its exclusive reseller and the plaintiff has no ownership right
of profit/loss in the business of the exclusive reseller.

16\. No doubt, Section 62 of the Copyright Act allows a plaintiff to file a
suit where the plaintiff is carrying on business, however, what is carrying on
a business has been decided and pronounced upon in Dhodha House's case (supra)
and therefore even though plaintiff can file a suit where it carries on
business in infringement cases under the Copyright Act, however when a
plaintiff is a company, carrying on business by a company CS(OS) No. 2660/2015
Page 14 of 18 can only be where the plaintiff company has an office and it is
only through the office being the principal office or the sole office or the
registered office or the subordinate office that the company can be said to
carry on business ie a company's carrying of business is not seen
independently of existence of an office and merely selling of goods by a
company without office at the place where the goods are sold will not mean
that the company is said to be "carrying on business" simply because of
selling of goods.

17\. I may at this stage make reference to paras 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the
judgment in the case of Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. (supra) because
these paras in my opinion further make it clear that carrying on business of a
company is necessarily with respect to carrying on business only through an
office being a principal office or a subordinate office. These paras
reproduced below show that wherever the expression "carrying on business" is
used, after that expression there is a stroke showing an alternative that when
carrying on business of a company is concerned, carrying on business has
necessarily to be only through an office of a company. These paras are
therefore in accordance with paras 49 & 50 of the judgment in Dhodha House's
case (supra) which clarifies that a company cannot be said to be carrying on
business merely because it sells its goods at CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 15 of
18 a particular place. These paras read as under:-

> "14. 'Corporation' in the Explanation would mean not only the statutory

> (4) SCC 270] and New Moga Transport Co., through its Proprietor v. United
> India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. [2004 (4) SCC 677]. The domicile of the

18\. In view of the above, taking the averments in paras 1 & 6 of the plaint
as deemed to be correct, yet this Court would not have territorial
jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit. This suit can only be
instituted at Hyderabad where the cause of action arises, wholly or in part.
CS(OS) No. 2660/2015 Page 17 of 18 Plaintiff could have filed a suit in Delhi
if cause of action may not have arisen wholly or in part in Delhi and there
was no infringement in Delhi but that was subject to the condition that
plaintiff carries on business through its office at Delhi and which is not the
position in the present case.

19\. Accordingly, the suit plaint is directed to be returned to the plaintiff
for being filed in the court of correct territorial jurisdiction. In case the
plaintiff does not receive back the plaint from the Registry of this Court
within six weeks, the suit will stand dismissed.
