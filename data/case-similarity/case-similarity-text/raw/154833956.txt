     VIPIN SANGHI, J.
    

1\. The present appeals have been filed by the appellants Schering
Corporation, Schering-Plough Ltd. and Fulford (India) Ltd. under Order 43 Rule
1(r) CPC. They are directed against the identical orders dated 04th July, 2008
passed by the Learned Single Judge dismissing the appellants'/plaintiffs'
applications under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 in the two suits CS (OS) No.730/2007
(out of which FAO(OS) No. 313/2008 arises) and CS(OS) No.361/2007 (out of
which FAO(OS) 314/2008 arises) and vacating the ex parte ad interim orders of
injunction passed in the said suits.

2\. These interim applications had been filed to seek grant of an interim
injunction to restrain the Respondent Alkem Laboratories Ltd. (Defendant in
CS(OS) NO. 730/2007) (hereinafter referred to as ALKEM) and Getwell Sciences
India Pvt. Ltd ( Defendant in Suit No. 361/2007) (hereinafter referred to as
GETWELL) from using the marks TEMOKEM and TEMOGET respectively in relation to
their pharmaceutical products

\-- the active ingredient whereof is TEMOZOLOMIDE, a drug administered for the
treatment of brain cancer.

3\. The appellants filed the aforesaid two suits to, inter alia, seek
permanent injunction to restrain infringement of registered trademarks,
copyright, passing off, dilution, unfair competition, FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 2 of 64 rendition of accounts of profits, deliver-up etc.
against the aforesaid respondents ALKEM & GETWELL respectively.

4\. The appellants have disclosed the genesis of the TEMOZOLOMIDE molecule and
its marks TEMODAL and TEMODAR used by the appellants. In 1984 one Professor
Steven synthesized a molecule and named it TEMOZOLOMIDE. In 1991 the Cancer
Research Campaign Technology Ltd., UK acquired rights to the TEMOZOLOMIDE
technology from its maker, Prof. Stevens. In 1992 the appellants obtained
worldwide license for TEMOZOLOMIDE technology from the aforesaid Cancer
Technology Ltd. and initiated their research and development of a brain cancer
drug. The drug was approved as a medical drug for cancer treatment in 1999.
The appellants then filed for TEMODAL as their Trademark for their
TEMOZOLOMIDE-based drug. According to the appellants the drug is being sold in
India ever since 17.01.2000. Even the mark TEMODAL was registered in India in
favor of the appellant vide registration no.687936 w.e.f. 23.11.1995 in class
5, which, inter alia, relates to pharmaceuticals including alkylating
cytotoxic agents for the treatment of various types of cancer. Similarly,
TEMODAR is registered in name of appellant no. 3 vide registration no. 888816
w.e.f 29.11.1999.

5\. The appellants claim that they are global science-based health care
business entities with leading prescription, consumer and animal health
products. The mark TEMODAL existed in the appellants' portfolio since 1978 and
was first applied by them for FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 3 of 64
―Psychopharmaceutical Preparations‖ in Class 5 in Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
The appellants commenced sales in Europe and thereafter in other parts of the
world along with filing for registration of the mark TEMODAL in those
respective countries, which they successfully acquired too.

6\. The appellants claim to have came to know that the respondent ALKEM was
marketing and selling an almost identically positioned drug (for treatment of
brain cancer or glioblastoma multiforme) under the mark TEMOKEM which,
according to the appellants, was phonetically, linguistically, textually,
visibly, manifestly, confusingly and deceptively similar to their marks
TEMODAL/TEMODAR. They also came to know that the respondent ALKEM had
submitted a ―Proposed to be used‖ application bearing number 1348168 in class
5 for registration of the mark TEMOKEM and the same was advertised in
Trademark Journal no. 1335-0 dated 01.11.2006 made available to the public on
03.03.2007. In answer to this, the appellants have filed a notice of
opposition dated 23.03.2007 to the above application and the same is still
pending.

7\. The appellants alleged infringement of trademarks under section 29 of the
Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as ‗The Act') and also passing
off against the respondent ALKEM, in their civil suit, being CS(OS) No.730 of
2007 filed on the original side of this Court.

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 4 of 64

8\. It appears that the learned Single Judge passed an ex parte ad interim
order of injunction in favour of the appellants, and against the respondent
ALKEM on 23.04.2007 thereby restraining the respondent ALKEM from
launching/using, advertising, promoting, stocking, offering for sale or
distributing or otherwise using trademark ―TEMOKEM‖ or any other mark
deceptively or confusingly similar to that of the plaintiff's registered
trademark ―TEMODAL/TEMODAR‖ as a drug used especially for treatment of brain
cancer. However, after notice to the respondent ALKEM, and after hearing the
parties the learned Single Judge by the impugned order has vacated the
aforesaid order dated 23.04.2007 and dismissed the appellants' application
under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 CPC being I.A. No.4555/2007 while allowing
respondent's application being I.A. No.6041/2007 filed under Order 39 Rule 4
CPC.

9\. Similarly, in CS (OS) No.361/2007 wherein GETWELL is the defendant, the
appellants claimed that they came to know in December, 2006 of the
defendant/respondent marketing and selling an identically positioned drug by
GETWELL under the brand name ‗TEMOGET' in Delhi and also in other towns of
India. The appellants also stated that they had made enquiries with regard to
the making of an application for registration of the trademark ‗TEMOGET' by
the respondent GETWELL, but the search had produced no results.

10\. The learned Single Judge initially passed an ex parte ad interim
injunction order on 27.02.2007 thereby restraining GETWELL FAO (OS)
Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 5 of 64 from advertising, promoting, stocking,
offering for sale or distributing or otherwise using trademark ―TEMOGET‖ or
any other mark deceptively or confusingly similar to that of the plaintiff's
registered trademark ―TEMODAL/TEMODAR‖ as a drug used especially for treatment
of brain cancer. After notice to and hearing the respondent GETWELL the ex
parte ad interim order of injunction was vacated by the impugned order dated
04.07.2008 and the appellants application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC being
I.A. No.2226/2007 was dismissed.

11\. The learned Single Judge in his impugned orders observed that the term
‗TEMO' used in the appellant's registered trademarks as well as in the
respondent's trademarks are derived from the name of the chemical compound
TEMOZOLOMIDE. To the said term ‗TEMO' the appellants had added the suffix
‗DAL' and ‗DAR' to arrive at the trademarks ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR'
respectively. On the other hand, respondents had added the suffix ‗KEM' and
‗GET' which are the parts of the respondent's company names, to arrive at the
trademark ‗TEMOKEM' and ‗TEMOGET' respectively. The learned Single Judge held
that all the trademarks, as aforesaid, are portmanteau words. He further held
as follows:

> ―A portmanteau word is used to describe a linguistic blend, namely, a word
> formed by blending sounds from two or more distinct words and combining
> their meanings. Examples of portmanteau words are - brunch (breakfast +
> lunch); Tanzania (Tanganyika + Zanzibar). As per the Wikipedia, portmanteaus
> can also be created by attaching a prefix or suffix from one word to give
> that association to FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 6 of 64 other
> words. For example, the suffix ‗holism' or ‗holic' taken from the word
> ‗alcoholism' or ‗alcoholic' can be added to a noun, creating a word that
> describes an addiction to that noun. For example, chocoholic means a person
> who is addicted to chocolate and workaholic means a person who is addicted
> to work and so on.

> Portmanteau words can also be used to describe bilingual speakers who use
> words from both languages while speaking. For instance, a person would be
> considered speaking ‗Spanglish' if he is using both Spanish and English
> words at the same time. Similarly, the portmanteau word ‗Hinglish' would
> refer to the usage of Hindi and English words at the same time.‖

12\. He held that the respondents were able to show the derivation of the
trademarks ‗TEMOKEM' and ‗TEMOGET' by employing ‗TEMO' from TEMOZOLOMIDE and
‗KEM' from the name of the respondent ALKEM and, similarly, ‗GET' from the
name of the respondent GETWELL, respectively. The combined effect of ‗TEMO'
and ‗KEM' would be TEMOZOLOMIDE manufactured by Alkem Laboratories. Similarly,
the combined effect of ‗TEMO' and ‗GET' is TEMOZOLOMIDE manufactured by
Getwell.

13\. The learned Single Judge relied on the decision of this court in Kalindi
Medicure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited and Anr. 2007 (34) PTC 18
(Del) wherein this Court had taken note of the established practice that in
pharmaceutical trade names of various drugs are often almost similar to each
other, having common prefixes or suffixes, for the reason that the name of the
drug conveys as to which salt / compound it is a derivative of. In that case,
while one of FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 7 of 64 the products was
sold in the form of pills in aluminum foils, the other competing product was
sold in pre filled syringes. The price difference in the competing products
was also taken into account for vacating the ex parte injunction granted in
favour of the plaintiff in that case.

14\. The learned Single Judge heavily relied on the Division Bench Judgment of
this Court in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Orchid Chemicals &
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2007 (34) PTC 469 (DB) (Delhi) which concerned the claim
for infringement of the plaintiffs/appellants registered trademark ‗MERONEM'
by the defendants/respondents use of the trademark ‗MEROMER'. Both the
products were derived from the active ingredient ‗MEROPENEM'. The Division
Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that ‗MEROPENEM' is a molecule
which is used for treatment of bacterial infection and the term ‗MERO' being
an abbreviation of the generic term ‗MEROPENEM' was publici juris.
Consequently, the appellants/plaintiffs in that case were held not entitled to
claim exclusive rights to the use of the term ‗MERO' as a constituent of the
trademark in question as it was descriptive of the appellants'/plaintiffs'
drug. The Division Bench further held that the common feature in both the
competing marks ‗MERO' being descriptive and publici juris, the customers
would tend to ignore the common feature and would pay more attention to the
uncommon features namely ‗MER' and ‗NEM', which were clearly dissimilar. The
following paragraph from the said decision of the Division Bench was
particularly referred by the learned Single Judge : FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 8 of 64

> ―19. Admittedly, ‗Mero', which is common to both the competing marks, is
> taken by both the appellants/plaintiffs and the respondent/ defendant from
> the drug ―Meropenem', taking the prefix ‗Mero' which is used as a prefix in
> both the competing marks. Both the appellants/plaintiffs and the respondent/
> defendant are marketing the same molecule ‗Meropenem'. Neither the
> appellants/plaintiffs nor the respondent/defendant can raise any claim for
> exclusive user of the aforesaid word ‗Meropenem'. Along with the aforesaid
> generic/common prefix, ‗Mero', the appellants/ plaintiffs have used the
> syllables ‗nem', whereas, the respondent/defendant has used the syllable
> ‗mer'. It is true that the aforesaid words/trade names cannot be deciphered
> or considered separately, but must be taken as a whole. But even if they are
> taken as a whole, the prefix ‗Mero' used with suffix in the two competing
> names, distinguishes and differentiates the two products. When they are
> taken as a whole, the aforesaid two trademarks cannot be said to be either
> phonetically or visually or in any manner deceptively similar to each
> other.‖

15\. The learned Single Judge noted the view of the Division Bench in
Astrazeneca (supra) that in the trade of drugs it was a common practice to
name the drug by the name of the organ or ailment which it treated or the main
ingredient of the drug. The name of such an organ, ailment or ingredient being
publici juris or generic, could not be claimed by anyone exclusively for use
as a trademark. The argument of the appellant that it was the first to have
adopted and use the name ‗TEMO', and that the appellants had trans-border
reputation [which were claimed to be the distinguishing feature from the
Astrazeneca (supra) case] was rejected by the learned Single Judge as the
claim of the appellants was founded upon an alleged FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 9 of 64 infringement of registered trademark. It was also not a
case where the respondents had raised a defence of prior use under Section 34
of the Act, where again, the question of ―who used the mark first‖ would be
relevant. The case of the appellants was one of infringement under Section 29
of the Act and the only question which required consideration was whether the
respondent's trademarks were deceptively similar to the appellants registered
trademarks, which could lead to confusion in the mind of the purchaser to
purchase the drugs of the respondents, while intending to purchase the
appellants drugs.

16\. The learned Single Judge held that the present cases are squarely covered
by the decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca (supra).

17\. The learned Single Judge also took note of the decision in Bhagwan Dass
Gupta Vs. Shri Shiv Shankar Tirath Yatra Company Pvt. Ltd. 93 (2001) DLT 406
wherein a learned Single Judge of this court noted that the basic test to find
out whether a trademark is publici juris is whether the mark has come to be so
public because of its universal use that it does not confuse or deceive, by
the use of it, the purchasers of the goods of the original trader. The learned
Single Judge held that as TEMOZOLOMIDE is a generic word and is publici juris
and nobody can claim exclusivity in respect of the same. Consequently, the
clipped expression ‗TEMO' derived from clipping FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 10 of 64 word TEMOZOLOMIDE would also be publici juris over
which no person could claim exclusive proprietorship.

18\. The learned Single Judge also placed reliance on another decision of this
Court in Cadila Laboratories Ltd. V. Dabur India Ltd., 1997 PTC (17) 417. The
competing marks considered in the said case were `MEXATE' AND `ZEXATE'. The
suffix `EXATE' was common to both the marks, the only difference being in the
prefix `M' & `Z'. It was held in that case that where the suffix is common,
prefix would have to be compared to see whether the marks are deceptively
similar. The following extract from Cadila (supra) was quoted by the learned
single Judge in the impugned order:

> ―As has been settled, while ascertaining two rival marks, as to whether they
> are deceptively similar or not, it is not permissible to dissect the words
> of the two marks. It is also held that the meticulous comparison of words,
> letter by letter and syllable by syllable, is not necessary and phonetic or
> visual similarity of the marks must be considered.‖

19\. The learned single Judge rejected the appellants reliance on the decision
of the Supreme Court in Milment Oftho Industries & Ors V. Allergan Inc., 2004
(28) PTC 585 (SC) on the ground that the said decision was rendered in a case
of passing of and not in an action for infringement of trade mark. The
competing marks in the case of Milment (supra) were identical. Both the
plaintiff and the defendant had adopted `OCUFLOX' as their trade mark.
However, in the present cases the marks of the appellants and the respondents
are not FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 11 of 64 identical. For the same
reason, the decision in Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals V. Intas
Pharmaceuticals & Anr., (2004) 28 PTC 456 (Del) (The Lipitor v. Lipicor case)
was distinguished.

20\. Reliance placed by the appellants on the decision in Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd & Ors V. Government of India & Ors, 1983 PTC 265 (Del)
(DB) was also rejected as it proceeded on the assumption that the appellants
products are superior to that of the respondent. The said basis could not be
accepted at the prima facie stage, particularly, when the respondent had
obtained drug licence under the Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940. For the same
reason, the learned Single Judge rejected the appellants reliance on the
decision in Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. V. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel & Ors.,
(2006) 8 SCC 726.

21\. The learned single Judge also held that the trade marks `TEMODAL' &
`TEMODAR' of the appellants were not identical with the trademarks TEMOKEM and
TEMOGET. He held that there was no phonetic or visual similarity between the
marks. The Court prima facie came to the conclusion that the suffix `KEM' and
‗GET' are entirely different and distinct from the suffix `DAL' and ‗DAR' used
in the appellants trademarks. Prima facie the comparison of the competing
marks did not show phonetic or visual similarity between the respondent's
marks with the trademarks of the appellants and the respondents' marks were
not prone to deceive the consumers. He also took into account the fact that
TEMOZOLOMIDE is a schedule ‗H' drug FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 12
of 64 which could be sold in retail only on the prescription of a registered
medical practitioner. The same, though not sufficient to answer a case of ―no
deception‖, was an important factor considering the fact that the product in
question is a highly specialized drug and used for specific treatment of a
type of brain cancer. The Court also took notice of the fact that in the case
of both the respondents, their packaging of the drugs contained the warning
―to be supplied against demand from cancer hospitals, institutions and against
the prescription of a cancer specialist only."

22\. The immense price difference between the products of the appellants on
the one hand and those of the respondents was also taken note of by the
learned single Judge. Whereas a set of 5 capsules of 100 mg of TEMODAL/TEMODAR
are sold for Rs.33,602/-, 5 capsules of 100 mg each of TEMOKAM are sold for
Rs.6,300/- and a set of 5 capsules of 250 mg each of TEMOGET sell for
Rs.12,000/-.

23\. For the aforesaid reasons, the learned single Judge dismissed the interim
injunction applications filed by the appellants in the two suits.

24\. Learned counsel for the parties have made elaborate submissions in
support of their cases.

25\. As noted above, the learned Single Judge has held that the present cases
are covered by the Division Bench decision in Astrazeneca (supra). We have,
therefore, gone through the said FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 13 of
64 judgment. Before we proceed further, in our view it is essential for us to
deal with the appellants' submissions vis-à-vis Astrazeneca (supra), as the
scope of the parties' submissions which we need to consider in this appeal
would depend upon our understanding of the said judgment.

26\. In Astrazeneca (supra) both the appellant/plaintiff and the
respondent/defendant had got their marks registered, though the
appellant/plaintiff had moved an application for rectification in respect of
the respondents/defendants trade mark `MEROMER'. The appellant had contended
that since 1995-96, the drug under the brand name `MERONEM' was being marketed
by it in over 89 countries. On the other hand, the respondent/defendant had
launched their drug `MEROMER' in India sometime in November, 2004 and they
were granted registration of the trade name `MEROMER' on the basis of their
application for registration filed on 2.8.2004 in Class 5. The
appellant/plaintiff had contended that the trade name `MEROMER' of the
respondent as a whole be compared with the trade mark of the
appellant/plaintiffs i.e. `MERONEM' and on such comparison it would be clear
that both are deceptively similar. On the other hand, the respondent/defendant
had contended that an action for infringement was not maintainable in view of
the provisions contained in Section 29 & 32(e) of the Act which provide, inter
alia, that use of a mark by its registered proprietor shall not constitute
infringement. FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 14 of 64

27\. The learned single Judge held that the two trademarks are phonetically
not similar and that the two marks are distinct. He also held that if an
injunction as sought for is granted by restraining the respondents/defendants
from selling, marketing or in any manner dealing with the drug `MEROPENEM'
under the trade name `MEROMER' there would be irreparable inconvenience caused
to the respondents/defendants, whereas the loss of the appellants/plaintiffs
if any, which is more financial in nature could be safeguarded by directing
the respondent/defendants to maintain accounts of sale under the trade name
`MEROMER'. The appellant/plaintiff in Astrazeneca (supra) placed reliance on
the decision of the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. V. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 2001 PTC 541 (SC). The Division Bench in Astrazeneca
culled out the principles laid down by the Supreme Court which would be
applicable to a passing off action involving medicinal products. The Supreme
Court held that the test to be applied to adjudge the violation of trade mark
may not be at par with the case involving non- medicinal products. The
Division Bench then proceeded to take notice of an earlier Division Bench
judgment of this Court in SBL Limited. V. Himalaya Drug company, 1997 PTC (17)
540 and quoted the following observation of the Court:

> ―25.(3) Nobody can claim exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or
> acronym which has become publici juris. In the trade of drugs it is common
> practice to name a drug by the name of the organ or ailment which it treats
> or the main ingredient of the drug. Such an organ FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
> 314/2008 Page 15 of 64 ailment or ingredient being publici juris or generic
> cannot be owned by anyone for use as trade mark.‖

28\. The Division Bench in Astrazeneca (supra) also referred to two other
decisions in M/s Biofarma V, Sanjay Medical Stores, 1997 PTC (17) 355 and
Cadila Laboratories V. Dabur India Limited, 1997 PTC (17) 417 wherein Dr.
Mukundakam Sharma, J, as his Lordship then was, had occasion to deal with the
trade names `TRIVEDON' and `FLAREDON' in the first case and `MEXATE' and
`ZEXATE' in the second case. The Division Bench culled out the following
extract from the decision in M/s Biofarma (supra):

> ―Section 2(d) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958, (hereinafter
> referred to as the Act) defines the word ‗deceptively similar' as which
> would be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly
> resembles that other mark so as likely to deceive or cause confusion. For
> deciding the question of deceptive similarity the Courts have laid down the
> following factors to be considered:

> (a) The nature of the marks, i.e. whether the marks are world marks or level
> marks or composite marks, i.e. both world and level marks.

> (b) the degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and
> hence similar in idea

> (c) the nature of the goods in respect of which they are used to trade marks

> (d) the similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of
> the rival traders.

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 16 of 64

> (e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the
> marks they require on education and intelligence and a degree of care they
> are likely to exercise in purchasing the goods.

> (f) the mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods; and

> (g) Any other surrounding circumstances.‖

29\. In M/s Biofarma (supra) it was held that since the opening syllable of
the two competing trade marks in the said case are completely different and
distinct, and in pharmaceutical trade it is natural to find names of various
drugs almost similar to each other or having the same prefix or suffix, the
competing marks viz. ‗FLAREDON' and ‗TRIVEDON' are dissimilar as the two marks
start with distinct dis- similarities so far as the first syllable is
concerned. Similarly, in the other decision namely, Cadila Laboratories v.
Dabur India Limited (supra) it was held that there is no possibility of
‗Mexate' being pronounced and read as ‗Zexate'. It was also laid down that
meticulous comparison of words, letter by letter and syllable by syllable, is
not necessary and phonetic or visual similarity of the marks must be
considered.

30\. The observation of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca (supra) in paragraph
19 has been taken note of by the learned single Judge and has been extracted
by us above. The Division Bench also took note of the fact that there are
other similar names with the prefix `MERO'. The Division Bench further
observed: -

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 17 of 64

> ―20. ........................... In the decisions of the Supreme Court and
> this Court also, it has been clearly held that nobody can claim exclusive
> right to use any word, abbreviation, or acronym which has become publici
> juris. In the trade of drugs, it is common practice to name a drug by the
> name of the organ or ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the
> drug. Such an organ ailment or ingredient being publici juris or generic
> cannot be owned by anyone exclusively for use as a trade mark. In the
> Division Bench decision of this Court in SBL Limited (supra) it was also
> held that possibility of deception or confusion is reduced practically to
> nil in view of the fact that the medicine will be sold on medical
> prescription and by licensed dealers well versed in the field and having
> knowledge of medicines. It was further held that the two rival marks,
> ‗Liv.52' and ‗LIV-T', contain a common feature, ‗Liv' which is not only
> descriptive, but also publici juris and that a customer will tend to ignore
> the common feature and will pay more attention to uncommon features i.e.
> '52' and 'T' and that the two do not have such phonetic similarity so as to
> make it objectionable.

> 21\. In our considered opinion the facts of the said case are almost similar
> and squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. 'Meropenem' is the
> molecule which is used for treatment of bacterial infections. In that view
> of the matter, the abbreviation ‗Mero' became a generic term, is publici
> juris and it is distinctive in nature. Consequently, the
> appellants/plaintiffs cannot claim exclusive right to the use of ‗Mero' as
> constituent of any trademark. The possibility of deception or confusion is
> also reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the medicine is
> sold only on prescription by dealers. The common feature in both the
> competing marks i.e. ‗Mero' is only descriptive and publici juris and,
> therefore, the customers would tend to ignore the common feature and would
> pay more attention to the uncommon feature. Even if they are expressed as a
> whole, the two did not have any phonetic similarity to make it
> objectionable. There are at least four other FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
> 314/2008 Page 18 of 64 registered users of the prefix ‗Mero' in India
> whereas the names of 35 companies using ‗Mero' trademarks, which have been
> registered or applied for registration, have been furnished in the
> pleadings.‖

31\. The Division Bench held that the two names, namely, ‗MERONEM' and
‗MEROMER' were prima facie dissimilar to each other. They were Schedule-H
drugs available only on doctor's prescription. The factum that the same were
available only on doctor's prescription and not as an over the counter
medicine was also considered relevant and it was held to have been rightly
taken note of by the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench also opined that
in its opinion, where the marks are distinct and the features are found to be
dis-similar, they are not likely to create any confusion. It was also admitted
by the parties that there was a difference in the price of the two products.
This fact was also considered relevant by the Division Bench. It was held that
the very fact that the two pharmaceutical products, one of the
appellants/plaintiffs and the other of the respondent/ defendant, were being
sold at different prices itself would ensure that there was no possibility of
any deception/confusion, particularly in view of the fact that customer who
came with the intention of purchasing the product of the appellants/plaintiffs
would never settle for the product of the respondent/defendant which was
priced much lower. The Bench held that it was apparent that the trademarks of
the two products in question were totally dissimilar and different.

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 19 of 64

32\. No doubt, in Astrazeneca (supra) the additional factor in favour of the
respondent/defendants that weighed in the mind of the Court was that the mark
of the respondent/defendant had also been registered, in respect whereof the
appellant/plaintiff had applied for rectification. However, to us it is clear
that the salient features which led the Court to deny the grant of interim
injunction to the appellant/plaintiff were:-

> a) The admission that `MEROPENEM' was the active salt/drug in the medicines
> manufactured by both the parties which was publici juris;

> b) That nobody could claim exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or
> acronym which has become publici juris and which is used descriptively;

> c) In the trade of drugs it is common practice to name a drug by the name of
> the organ or ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug. The
> name of an organ, ailment or ingredient being publici juris or generic if
> the use of the name is descriptive, the generic name cannot be claimed by
> anyone for exclusive use as a trade mark;

> d) `MERO' which was common to both the competing marks was taken from
> `MEROPENEM' in respect whereof neither party could claim exclusive user for
> ‗MEROPENEM' based drug. Both the parties had used FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
> 314/2008 Page 20 of 64 three letter suffixes i.e. `NEM' had been used by the
> appellant/plaintiff and `MER' had been used by the respondent/defendant,
> which were distinct and not deceptive;

> e) Even if the competing marks were to be taken as a whole, the suffixes
> ‗NEM' and ‗MER' distinguish and differentiate the two products. When they
> are taken as a whole, the aforesaid two trademarks could not be said to be
> either phonetically or visually, or in any manner deceptively similar to
> each other;

> f) The possibility of deception or confusion is reduced to practically `Nil'
> in view of the fact that the medicine would be sold by medical prescription
> and by licenced dealers well versed in the field and having knowledge of
> medicines. When two rival marks contain a common feature, which is not only
> descriptive but also publici juris, the consumer will tend to ignore the
> common feature and will pay more attention to the uncommon feature (for
> example in the case of Liv-52 V. Liv-T). If the uncommon features do not
> have phonetic similarity, the offending mark cannot be objected to. The
> drugs in question are Schedule H drugs available only on Doctor's
> prescription and are not over the counter medicines;

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 21 of 64

> g) There was a vast difference in the prices of the two products. This fact
> by itself would ensure that there is no possibility of any
> deception/confusion, particularly, in view of the fact that the customer who

33\. The fact situation in the two cases in hand are starkly similar to the
fact situation in Astrazeneca (supra). If one were to replace ‗MEROPENEM' with
‗TEMOZOLOMIDE', ‗MERO' with ‗TEMO', ‗MERONEM' with ‗TEMODAL'/'TEMODAR',
‗MEROMER' with ‗TEMOKEM'/'TEMOGET', ‗NEM' with ‗DAL'/'DAR' and ‗MER' with
‗KEM'/'GET', and proceed on the basis that ‗TEMO' is publici juris for
TEMOZOLOMIDE, each of the aforesaid factors (a) to (g) would hold true, in
principle, in the present cases as well.

34\. Mr. Datta submits that the following are the distinguishing features of
the present appeals from the decision in Astrazeneca (supra):

> i. Plaintiff conceded in Astrazeneca (Supra) that they were not claiming
> monopoly over just ―mero‖. But the appellants herein are asserting their
> exclusive right to use ―TEM‖/ ―TEMO‖.

> ii. Plaintiff did not specifically dispute that Mero was generic for
> Moroprenem-based drugs but FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 22 of 64
> argued that even if so, Meronem be compared to Meromer, both as a whole.
> However, the appellants dispute that TEM/TEMO is publici juris for
> TEMOZOLOMIDE.

> iii. Internationally a third party (other than plaintiff) had first adopted
> `Mero'. But in the present cases, it is the appellants alone who have
> adopted TEM/TEMO for their TEMOZOLOMIDE based drugs.

> iv. No pleading of transborder reputation was made in Astrazeneca (supra).
> Not a single piece of evidence filed in this regard. But the appellants have
> not only pleaded, but also demonstrated their transborder reputation.

> v. In Astrazeneca(supra), plaintiffs admitted that there were many other
> Meroprenem-based drugs incorporating `Mero' as part of the mark but took no
> action was taken against them. However, the appellants do not admit the use
> of TEM/TEMO for TEMOZOLOMIDE based drugs and have zealously protected their
> trademarks.

> vi. Plaintiffs disentitled themselves from discretionary relief by filing
> rectification after filing suit without taking statutory S. 124 permission.
> However, that is not the case in hand.

> vii. Court found that `Mero' was commonly used;

> that `Mero' became publici juris for Meroprenem-based drugs. No such
> conclusion can be drawn in respect of TEM/TEMO for TEMOZOLOMIDE.

> viii. Plaintiffs did not dispute that drugs are the same except only for
> shelf life owing to different buffering agent. No plea of superior
> formulation and better therapeutic effect was made in Astrazeneca (supra).
> However, the appellants' case is that their drug has a narrow therapeutic
> index and works differently than the products of the respondents.
    
    
    
          ix.     In Astrazeneca (supra), there was no recordal
                  of     assignment      in   favour   of     the
    

> appellants/plaintiffs. So none of the Plaintiffs were the recorded
> proprietors of the registration of `Meronem'. There is no dispute FAO (OS)
> Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 23 of 64 in the present cases with regard to
> the rights of the appellants to their trademarks.

> x. In Astrazeneca (supra), plaintiffs disentitled themselves from
> discretionary relief by concealing facts/details of assignment of
> registration. There is no such allegation against the appellants.

> xi. In Astrazeneca (supra), plaintiffs did not dispute that different
> formulations of the same molecule can be different in therapeutic value and
> thus legitimately different in price. Thus Cadila judgment was applicable.
> That is not the position in the present cases.

35\. The differences enumerated at sl. Nos.(i), (ii) and (vii) pertain to the
appellants' submission that ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' are not publici juris. We will deal
with this submission of the appellants. However, the so called differences at
sl. Nos.(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii), (ix), (x) and (xi) above, in our view,
are not material for the present purpose. These so called differences, in
fact, had no bearing on the decision in Astrazeneca (supra), even if it is
assumed that they existed, as they did not form the basis of the decision in
Astrazeneca (supra). Since in Astrazeneca (supra) it was not asserted by the
appellants/plaintiffs that ‗MERO' is not publici juris, whereas in the present
cases it is asserted by the appellants that TEM/TEMO is not publici juris, and
the decision in Astrazeneca was primarily founded upon the premise that ‗MERO'
is publici juris being an abbreviation of ‗MEROPENEM' (which admittedly was
generic), in our view that would be the only aspect which would require our
consideration to conclude whether or not the decision in Astrazeneca (supra)
would apply to the present case. If we FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page
24 of 64 conclude that ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' is publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE, even
the so called differences at sl. Nos.(i), (ii) and (vii) above would not
survive and the decision in Astrazeneca (supra) would become applicable
squarely to the present cases.

36\. We may note that the Division Bench decision in Astrazeneca (supra) has
also been followed in a recent decision of this Court in the case of Rhizome
Distilleries P. Ltd. and Ors. V. Pernod Ricard S.A. France and Ors,
MANU/DE/2742/2009 in FAO(OS) 484/2008 decided on 23.10.2008 by the Division
Bench comprising of Vikramajit Sen and V.K.Jain, JJ. In this decision, the
Division Bench observed as follows:-

> ―23. .............In Astrazeneca UK Limited v. Orchid Chemicals and
> Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2007(34) PTC 469 another Division Bench was called upon
> to decide the dispute in the use of the trademarks MEROMER and MERONEM, in
> respect of which the learned Single Judge had vacated the ad interim
> injunction granted earlier. The Division Bench observed that MERO was
> generic in character and concluded that the suffix in both the rival
> trademarks were sufficient to draw a distinction between the two. The Bench
> drew support from the LIV-52 and LIV-T litigation to uphold the refusal of
> an interim injunction. We can do no better than reproduce a passage from SBL
> Limited v. Himalaya Drug Company 1997 (17) PTC 540 in which Justice R.C.
> Lahoti, as his Lordship Chief Justice of India then was, spoke for the Bench
> in these words - "Nobody can claim exclusive right to use any generic word,
> abbreviation, or acronym which has become publici jurisdiction. In the trade
> of drugs it is common practice to name a drug by the name of the organ or
> ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug. Such an organ
> ailment or FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 25 of 64 ingredient being
> public jurisdiction or generic cannot be owned by anyone for use as a
> trademark". The jural message, therefore, is clear and unequivocal. If a
> party chooses to use a generic, descriptive, laudatory or common word, it
> must realize that it will not be accorded exclusivity in the use of such
> words.

> At the most, it may bring a challenge in the nature of passing off and in
> such an event the Court would look at the rival labels/packagings/trade
> dresses in order to determine whether a customer possessing a modicum memory
> and ordinary intelligence may be so confused as to purchase one product
> believing it to be the other.‖

37\. We are, therefore, of the view that to get out of the said decision in
Astrazeneca (supra), it is essential for the appellant to establish that
TEM/TEMO is not publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE.

38\. There is one other submission urged by Mr. Datta, which we would need to
address even if we hold against the appellants that, prima facie, ‗TEM'/'TEMO'
are publici juris, and the decision in Astrazeneca (supra) applies to and
binds the appellants' cases. He has submitted that even if ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' are
considered publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE, ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' have acquired a
secondary meaning for ‗TEMODAL'/‗TEMODAR' on account of the registration and
use of the said marks in over 100 countries, and on account of the
uninterrupted, longstanding use by the appellants.

39\. Mr. Datta submits that a word fragment of the word which denotes the
ingredient/pharmaceutical substance, may or may not be generic or publici
juris for that pharmaceutical substance. He submits FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 26 of 64 that even if the word fragment is publici juris, such
word fragment may acquire distinctiveness for that pharmaceutical substance in
the context of certain formulations containing that pharmaceutical substance
for certain indications i.e. for the particular goods, by acquiring a
secondary meaning from registrations and use, ceasing thereby to be
generic/publici juris for that pharmaceutical substance in that limited
context. He , therefore, argues that even if it is assumed for the sake of
argument that ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR' were originally generic/publici juris
for TEMOZOLOMIDE, TEM/TEMO as incorporated in ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR' have
since acquired distinctiveness by acquiring secondary meaning through,
registrations and use of ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR' in over 100 countries, and
thereby TEM/TEMO have ceased to be generic/ publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE in
the limited context of TEMOZOLOMIDE based brain cancer drugs, and ‗TEM/‗TEMO'
have acquired secondary meaning i.e. as abbreviations for ‗TEMODAL' and
‗TEMODAR'. In support of this submission, Mr. Datta cites example of
―Naukri.com‖, ‗Superflame' and ‗Ayur' and placed reliance on Glaxo Group Ltd.
& Ors. v. Vipin Gupta & Ors. 2006 (33) PTC 145 (Del). He also places reliance

40\. Mr. Datta submits that even if the adoption of the respondents marks is
assumed to be honest, it can be injuncted if the marks the appellants have
acquired distinctiveness. He cites the example of ―Dr. Reddy‖, which was
protected in Dr. Reddy's Lab. Ltd. v. Reddy Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2004 (29) PTC
435. He submits that a word-fragment that is generic/ publici juris for a word
which is descriptive for certain goods can and does sometimes acquire
distinctiveness as a source-cue for those goods. He refers to Plastindia
foundation v. Ajeet Singh 2002 (25) 71 (Del).

41\. The appellants have also contended that TEMODAL and TEMODAR are valid
trademarks and their registrations do not in any way, contravene Section 9 of
the Act. It is contended that these registrations are in accordance with the
WHO recommendation that the pharmaceutical trademarks ―should not be derived
from‖ the INN stems of the constituting chemical salts. It is argued that the
marks in FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 29 of 64 question, TEMODAL and
TEMODAR cannot be said to be derived from the chemical TEMOZOLOMIDE because: -

a. They are not trivial modification of the word TEMOZOLOMIDE; b. They are not
obtained by the elision of a single syllable from the word TEMOZOLOMIDE;

c. They are not substantially identical to the word TEMOZOLOMIDE; d. They are
not actually descriptive and not merely suggestive of the word TEMOZOLOMIDE;

e. They are not the legal equivalent of the word TEMOZOLOMIDE; f. They are not
so utterly descriptive so as to be disqualified.

42\. It is further submitted that the respondents have never filed any
rectification or opposition before the Registrar of Trademarks questioning the
registration of the appellants on the ground of they being ―derived from‖
TEMOZOLOMIDE.

43\. On the other hand, the respondents submit that they have adopted the
trademark TEMOKEM/TEMOGET bonafide and have merely followed the practice of
the pharmaceutical industry of deriving the name of the medicine from its
chemical molecule viz. TEMOZOLOMIDE, which is obviously generic. It is,
therefore, contended that the abbreviation or word-fragment, that is, TEM/TEMO
of that generic term would also be generic.

44\. The next line of argument of the respondent is that, as provided for
under Section 17 of the Act, registration of a trademark FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008
& 314/2008 Page 30 of 64 confers on the proprietor an exclusive right to the
use of the trademark taken as a whole and not for parts or fragments of the
mark. So the appellants cannot claim exclusivity in respect of word- fragments
which are publici juris and descriptive of the generic substance.

45\. The respondents also contend that there is no likelihood of confusion
between the drugs in question because of the vast price difference in the
drugs of the appellants on the one hand, and of the two respondents on the
other hand. They also contend that the drugs in question are Schedule-`H'
drugs and that the drugs of the respondents come with a medical warning that
they are to be sold only against demand from cancer hospitals, institutions
and against the prescription of a Cancer Specialist.

46\. The respondents have sought to place reliance on various decisions and
upon various published articles and text books on the relevant subject, which
shall be referred to a little later.

47\. We first proceed to deal with the submissions of Mr. Datta, which relate
to his argument that TEM/TEMO is not publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE.

48\. The crux of the appellants contention is that the word- fragment TEM/TEMO
of the word-name TEMOZOLOMIDE Is not generic/ publici juris, as it is not so
recognized either by: FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 31 of 64

> i) The WHO (in its notified list of INN-Stems or in its List of Radicals-
> Groups);

> ii) A standard dictionary or medical dictionary;

> iii) The market proliferation of brands of formulations of the
> pharmaceutical substance incorporating the word-fragment TEM/TEMO, which
> market proliferation is a) uncontested; b) longstanding (c) extensive and
> (d) significant.

49\. The expression "publici juris" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary
(Eighth Edition ) as-

> ‖of public right; of importance to or available to the public <a city holds
> title to its streets as property publici juris> <words that are in general
> or common use and that are merely descriptive and publici juris and cannot
> be appropriated as a trademark>.‖

50\. The concept of ‗public', for the purpose of determining whether a word is
publici juris for an article or thing would depend on what that article or
thing is. For example, if the article or thing is one typically belonging to
the field of aeronautics, the knowledge of the general public i.e. the common
man on the street, of the meaning of the word would not be relevant. The
meaning of the word would have to be gathered from the knowledge of the
‗public' knowledgeable in the field of aeronautics, to determine whether the
word is publici juris for the article or thing for which it is claimed to be
publici juris. Similarly, to determine whether ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' is publici juris
for TEMOZOLOMIDE, the query would have to be directed to those who would
normally be expected to have knowledge of what FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 32 of 64 TEMOZOLOMIDE and ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' mean. If people engaged
in the treatment of, and research in the field of brain cancer use the word
‗TEM'/‗TEMO' for TEMOZOLOMIDE, in our view, it would be fair to conclude that
‗TEM'/‗TEMO' are publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE.

51\. The submission of the appellants that ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' is not generic/
publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE because it is not notified as a INN STEM or is
not listed as one of the radical groups by the WHO; that it is not so
mentioned in a standard dictionary or medical dictionary is fallacious, as it
proceeds on the assumption that for a medicine related word/term to become
publici juris, it must either to listed as an INN Stem or a radical group by
the WHO or by a standard dictionary or medical dictionary. There is nothing to
suggest that these sources are exhaustive of medical terms which are publici
juris. Whether or not a medical term is publici juris is an issue of fact,
which would have to be established at the trial of the suits. At this stage
only a prima facie view has to be formed, which is not the final view.
Therefore, if there is some material available to show that TEM/TEMO has been
used to describe TEMOZOLOMIDE or any other chemical compound, TEM/TEMO would,
prima facie, be publici juris.

52\. The respondents have placed on record a medical study published in the
journal of nuero-oncology by the Duke University, wherein TEMO has been used
for TEMOZOLOMIDE. There is another article on the subject of ―Synthesis and
antibacterial activity of dual- action agents of a β-lactam antibiotic with
cytotoxic agent FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 33 of 64 mitozolomide or
TEMOZOLOMIDE, wherein TEMOZOLOMIDE has been denoted by TEMO.

53\. It is also interesting to note from the above mentioned latter article
that there is another chemical compound by the name of MITOZOLOMIDE. The
extension ‗ZOLOMIDE' itself appears to be publici juris for a group of
chemical compounds having some common features/properties. Therefore, it
appears to be quite natural to refer to TEMOZOLOMIDE as ‗TEMO' just as
MITOZOLOMIDE is described as ‗MITO'.

54\. We may also take note of the fact that on the website www.allacronyms.com
on keying the abbreviation ‗TEM', the same leads to, inter alia, TEMOZOLOMIDE.
On the website www.medilexicom.com a search for medical abbreviation ‗TEM',
inter alia, results in ‗TEMOZEPAM' and TEMOZOLOMIDE. We are not suggesting
that these instances establish that ‗TEM'/'TEMO' are publici juris for
TEMOZOLOMIDE. But these are instances, which establish that the materials and
documents produced by the appellants, to show that ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' refer to
TEMODAL and/or TEMODAR are not exhaustive to conclude, at this interlocutory
stage, that ‗TEM'/'TEMO' is not publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE, and that they
necessarily refer exclusively to TEMODAL and TEMODAR.

55\. McCarthy in Trademarks and Unfair Competition, inter alia, states:

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 34 of 64

> ―Clearly, one seller cannot appropriate a previously used generic name of a
> thing and claim exclusive rights in it as a ―trademark‖ for that thing.
> Similarly, if one seller develops trademark rights in a term which a
> majority of the relevant public then appropriates as the name of a product,
> the mark is a victim of ―genericide‖ and trademark rights may cease.‖ ―An

> generic connotation of the abbreviated name is still generic.‖

56\. The Madras High Court in Indo-Pharma Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd., Mumbai
v. Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Madras 1998 (18) PTC (DB) (Mad) while
dealing with two marks ‗Enerjex' and ‗Enerjase' held that the abbreviation of
a generic word will also be generic. Reliance was placed on the aforesaid
extract from McCarthy in Trademarks and Unfair Competition. Since the
components ‗Jase' and ‗Jex' were completely dissimilar, injunction was refused
by the Court to the plaintiff. The Madras High Court held as follows:

> ―The two rival marks ‗ENERJEX' and ‗ENERJASE' contain the common feature
> ‗ENERJ' which is not only descriptive but also publici juris. Therefore a
> customer will tend to ignore the common feature and will pay more attention
> to uncommon features i.e `JEX' and `JASE'. These two cannot be said to have
> such phonetic similarity so as to make it objectionable.‖ ―So the word
> `ENERG/J' used as a prefix in both the trade names is the abbreviation of
> the generic term of the English word `energy'. As such, it is descriptive in
> nature and common in usage. Nobody can claim an exclusive right to FAO (OS)
> Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 35 of 64 the use of the word `ENERG/J' as the
> constituent of any trademark.‖

57\. In The Cellular Clothing Company (supra), the Court held the following:-

> ―If a man invents a new article and protects it by a patent then during the
> term of the patent, he has of course a legal monopoly, but when the Patent
> expires all the world may make the article, and for that purpose use the
> name which the Patentee has attached to it during the time when he had the
> legal monopoly of the manufacture. But my Lords, the same thing in principle
> must apply where a man has not taken out a Patent, as in the present case,
> but has a virtual monopoly because other manufacturers, although they are
> entitled to do so, have not in fact commenced to make the article.‖(emphasis
> supplied).

58\. The argument of the appellants that to establish that the term TEM/TEMO
is publici juris, there should be market proliferation of various brands of
‗TEMOZOLOMIDE' incorporating the word fragment TEM/TEMO, which market
proliferation is un-contested, longstanding, extensive and significant, cannot
be accepted in our view, particularly in the light of the fact that the
products of the appellants' enjoyed a patent and, consequently, the appellants
enjoyed a statutory monopoly. It is only on account of the fact that the
product patent in this country was not protected till the amendment in the law
in 2005, that the respondents' have been able to manufacture the said drug.
FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 36 of 64 Obviously, during the tenure of
the said statutory monopoly, none could validly manufacture and sell the said
drug by whatever name.

59\. Therefore, merely because the molecule TEMOZOLOMIDE may have been
patented and commercially pioneered by the appellants, they do not become
entitled, on the statutorily protected monopoly disappearing, to prevent
others from calling, what the molecule is, by its generic name, and such other
names which are ―publicly‖ known to describe and denote it.

60\. In McCain International Limited (supra), the Court held:

> ―Here the plaintiffs have brought the article oven chips before the world,
> they have given it a name descriptive of that article, they have had a
> monopoly in it before other persons have entered into competition with them
> and they cannot now claim a monopoly of that name. All they can claim is
> that other person who make the same article shall distinguish their products
> by the appropriate means, which the defendants have adopted in this case, of
> making it quite clear that the products they produce come from County Fair
> and Birds Eye respectively.‖

61\. TEMO has been used for TEMOZOLOMIDE by several parties apart from the
respondents, namely, Cipla Limited, who use the brand name ‗TEMOSIDE', Netco
Pharma Limited, who use the brand name ‗TEMONET' and Dabur Pharma Limited, who
use the brand name ‗TEMOZEM'. There are a number of other similar marks with
the prefix TEM/TEMO for drugs, which are present in the market. The appellants
FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 37 of 64 have themselves pointed out
that TEM/TEMO is contained as a part of the trade mark of a variety of
different pharmacological groups, such as (i) TEMSIROLIMUS (an anti kidney-
cancer agent); (ii) TEMOPORFIN (a photosensitizing anti cancer agent like
TEMOZOLOMIDE); (iii) TEMOCILLIN (antibiotic); (iv) TEMOCAPRIL (anti
hypertensive). We may also notice that from the documents filed by the
appellants it appears that there are various other drugs having the prefix
TEM/TEMO such as TEMARIL- trademark for preparations of trimeprazine tartrate;
TEMAZEPAM- a benzodiazepine used as a sedative and hypnotic in the treatment
of insomnia, administered orally; TEMEFOS- USAN for temephos; TEMEPHOS- an
organophosphorous insecticide used a a larvicide for control of mosquitoes and
blackflies and as a veterinary ectoparasiticide; TEMODOX- a veterinary growth
stimulant; TEMOVATE- trademark for preparations of clobetasol propionate.

62\. It has been repeatedly recognized that in the trade of drugs it is a
common practice to name a drug on the basis of the name of its active chemical
compound or salt, or the disease it seeks to remedy, or the particular organ
it is intended to treat. The name of such an ingredient or compound, ailment
or organ being in the public domain and of generic nature, which has been used
descriptively, cannot be claimed by anyone for use exclusively as only his/her
trademark.

63\. From the materials produced by the respondent, it is evident that
TEM/TEMO have been employed in place of TEMOZOLOMIDE or as abbreviations for
certain other medicines. No doubt TEM/TEMO have FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 38 of 64 also been used in place of ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR'.
However, there is nothing to suggest that TEM/TEMO mean, and only mean,
TEMODAL/TEMODAR and nothing else. Even when TEM/TEMO is used in relation to
‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR', the reference is actually to the chemical compound
TEMOZOLOMIDE, which is the active ingredient in ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR'.

64\. Consequently, in our view, prima facie the word fragment TEM/TEMO is
publici juris and also generic for and descriptive of the chemical compound,
TEMOZOLOMIDE, and, therefore, the appellants cannot claim the exclusive right
to use thereof. The decision in Astrazeneca (supra) has rightly been held to
apply on all fours to the cases in hand.

65\. As the appellants have chosen to brand their product with a generic and
descriptive prefix ‗TEMO', any other person entering the market would be
entitled to use the said term to identify the product in question. If the
appellants were desirous of avoiding such a situation they should have branded
their drug with a unique name instead of a descriptive name. [see Rhizome
Distilleries P. Ltd. (supra)]

66\. We now proceed to consider the second plea of Mr. Datta, that assuming
that ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' are publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE, ‗TEM'/‗TEMO' have
acquired a secondary meaning for TEMODAL and TEMODAR for the reasons stated by
him and that, therefore, the appellants alone are entitled to the exclusive
use of the same. Since FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 39 of 64 various
cases have been cited in this regard, we proceed to deal with each one of
them.

67\. In Glaxo Group (supra), the court was dealing with the plaintiff's marks
‗BETNOVATE' and ‗CROCIN' on the one hand and ‗BETAVAT' and ‗CORINAL' on the
other hand. The court held on a comparison of the various features in the get
up of the competing products, that the products of the defendants could be
passed off as that of the plaintiff. The court held that the mark ‗CORINAL'
does not appear to be deceptively or confusingly similar to the trademark
‗CROCIN', but confusion is sought to be created by adopting similar
strip/packaging as that of the plaintiff. The defendant was found to be using
the logo ‗SGS' in the same manner as the plaintiff's logo ‗GSK' within a heart
shaped device. The court found that even though the competing marks were not
identical, the marks used by the defendants so nearly resembled the
plaintiff's trademarks as was likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation
to the similar goods, on account of the adoption of the similar getup by the
defendant in respect of its products. The above was the basis for the grant of
injunction by the Court in favour of the plaintiff.

68\. This decision does not advance the proposition canvassed by the
appellants that even if TEM/TEMO were originally generic/publici juris for
TEMOZOLOMIDE, TEM/TEMO as incorporated in ‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR' have since
acquired distinctiveness and that TEM/TEMO have acquired a secondary meaning
through registration and use of FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 40 of 64
‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEOMDAR' in over hundred countries and thereby ceased to be
generic/publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE in the context of TEMOZOLOMIDE based
brain cancer drugs. The position in the following cases cited by the
appellants is the same, which are discussed below in paragraphs 69 to 88. The
grant of injunction in all these cases, it would be seen, was, inter alia,
either on account of similar get up or on account of minimal difference in the
trade name leading to structural and/or phonetic and/or visual similarity in
the competing marks, and not on account of the Court allowing appropriation of
a term which is publici juris by the plaintiff on the ground that the publici
juris term has acquired a secondary meaning to denote the product of the
plaintiff alone.

69\. In Win-medicare Limited (supra) the plaintiff had brought the action for
passing off. The competing trademarks were ‗DICLOMOL' of the plaintiff and
‗DICMOL' of the defendant. It was not an action founded upon Section 29 of the
Act for infringement of registered trademark. Neither of the two trademarks in
question in that case were registered. The court concluded that the two marks
were structurally and phonetically similar which gave the impression that the
defendant had copied the mark of the plaintiff. It was on this basis that the
court had granted the injunction. The difference in ‗DICLOMOL' and ‗DICMOL'
was only that the two letters ‗LO' had been removed from the plaintiff's mark
by the defendant while coining its FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 41 of
64 own mark ‗DICMOL'. On account of the structural and phonetic similarity the
court had granted the injunction.

70\. Similarly, in Wyeth Holdings (supra) while considering whether the mark
―FOLV' of the defendant was deceptively similar to the mark ‗FOLVITE' of the
plaintiff, the court held that the two competing marks have to be considered
as a whole. The structure of the mark visually and phonetically must be borne
in mind. The image that the court must have is that of the quintessential
common man. It was held: "when the Judge looks at phonetics, the sound which
accompanies the pronunciation of the mark is the sound of the mark to an
ordinary purchaser bereft of the niceties of language." Neither the term ‗FOL'
derived from ‗FOLIC ACID'; nor the term ‗VITE' derived from ‗VITAMIN' were
treated as being the proprietary of the plaintiff and that was not the basis
of the said decision.

71\. In USV Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd (supra) the Intellectual
Property Board was considering the two competing marks ‗PIOZULIN' and ‗PIOZ'.
Both were held to be structurally one and the same and they even looked alike.
It was for this reason that the Appellate Board declared the registration
obtained by the respondent to be invalid.

72\. In USV Ltd. v. IPCA Lab. Ltd. (supra) the Madras High Court was
considering the two competing marks namely, ‗PIOZ' of the plaintiff and
‗PIOZED' of the defendant. Since they were found to be FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 42 of 64 phonetically similar and were drugs intended to be used
for the same disease, the court injuncted the defendant from adopting the mark
‗PIOZED'. The active ingredient in the two drugs in question was ‗PIOGLITAZONE
HYDROCLORIDE'. It was held that the prescription given by the doctors for
purchase of medicines ‗PIOZ' or ‗PIOZED' will be in scribbling and the
spelling normally written by doctors may not be read by common man and even by
the English knowing literates. Even the chemists in the drug stores may not be
able to make out a distinction between the ‗PIOZ' and ‗PIOZED' scribbled by
the doctors. It was on this account that the court granted injunction in
favour of the plaintiff. The court even in this case did not hold that the
plaintiff was entitled to the exclusive use of the abbreviated version of the
generic active compound in the medicine namely ―PIOGLITAZONE HYDROCLORIDE‖.

73\. In Anglo French Co. (supra) the Punjab and Haryana High Court was
concerned with the plaintiffs registered mark ‗BEPLEX' and the defendant's
mark ‗BELPLEX' being used for vitamin ‗B COMPLEX' tablets. Even in this case
the court concluded that there was deceptive similarity both phonetic and
visual in the goods manufactured by the parties which is likely to cause
confusion and deception in the minds of the purchasers. On this account the
court granted injunction in favour of the appellant/plaintiff. This decision
also, therefore, is of no avail to the appellants.

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 43 of 64

74\. In Water Bush Well (supra) a learned Single Judge of this court was
dealing with a claim for infringement of trademark ‗AMCLOX' of the plaintiff,
by the defendant who had adopted ‗AMPCLOX'. The court granted injunction on
the ground that ‗AMCLOX' and ‗AMPCLOX- 500' were both visually and
phonetically similar to deceive and to cause confusion amongst the buyers of
the products. The court also took into account that the mere insertion of the
letter ‗P' in the defendant's mark would not make a difference while hearing
the name of the mark. The court also compared the colour combination of the
capsules. No doubt, the argument that the drug was a Schedule-H drug was
advanced by the defendant, and the same was rejected by the court on the
ground that for a minor complaint or indisposition one does not always go to
the medical practitioner and the same medical preparation (even though they
are Schedule H drugs) would be administered by a patient/person by directly
approaching the chemist, in our view the said distinction cannot be held good
in the present case as we are dealing with a drug meant for treating brain
cancer which, by no means, can be described as a minor complaint or
indisposition. As noticed by the learned Single Judge the medicines/drugs in
question contain a warning that the same can be sold only on the prescription
of not just any ordinary medical practitioner, but on the prescription of only
a Cancer Hospital or Cancer Specialist. We may hasten to add that we are not
commenting on the view of the learned Single Judge, as aforesaid, one way or
another, as it is not necessary for us to do so FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 44 of 64 in view of the materially different factual context.
This decision also, therefore does not support the appellants cases.

75\. In Biochem Pharmaceuticals Limited (supra) the learned Single Judge of
this Court was concerned with the trademarks ‗BIOCILIN' and ‗BICILLIN' in
respect of the same drug. Once again the court concluded that there was
phonetic deceptive similarity in the two marks which is likely to lead to
confusion and deception. Though the relief of injunction was granted, it was
not on the basis that the appellant was entitled to appropriate the generic
name of the two drugs in question namely ‗AMPICILLIN' and ‗CLOXACILLIN'. In
this case both the parties were manufacturing the drug by combining
‗AMPICILLIN' and ‗CLOXACILLIN'. The appellant had used the mark ‗BIOCILLIN' as
it was a combination of two drugs. Consequently, ‗Bio', of which ‗Bi' means
two, was used as a prefix to coin the word ‗BIOCILLIN'. The respondent had
done the same and had merely dropped the letter ‗O' and introduced an extra
‗L' in the trademark adopted by it. This case, therefore, has no relevance.

76\. Beecham Group PLC (supra) is a decision of Intellectual Property Board,
Chennai in respect of the application made by the applicant for registration
of the mark ‗LYMOXYL'. The trademark ‗AMOXIL' belonged to the objector. Once
again the court held that the mark adopted by the applicant was phonetically,
structurally and deceptively similar to that of the objector. The only
difference in the applicants trade name was the employment of the letters ‗LY'
and ‗M'. FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 45 of 64 Like the earlier
decisions this decision does not advance the proposition propounded by the
appellants, and is, therefore, of no relevance.

77\. In Obsurge Biotech Limited (supra) the common trademark was ‗SERADIC'.
Since the two marks were identical in respect of medicinal preparations, the
rectification application was allowed. This case has absolutely no relevance
for our purpose.

78\. Lyka Labs (supra) also is a decision of IPAB, Chennai dealing with the
marks ‗TAMIACIN' and ‗TAMNIFO' on the one hand and the mark ‗TAMIN' on the
other hand. The Appellate Board was examining whether ‗TAMIN' is deceptively
similar to the registered marks ‗TAMIACIN' and ‗TAMNIFO'. The Board held that
the mark ‗TAMIN' was phonetically, visually or structurally similar to the
respondents mark ‗TAMIACIN'. Once again this decision did not proceed on the
basis that a party could appropriate to itself the generic name or the
abbreviation of the chemical active compound in a drug.

79\. Baroda Pharma Private Limited (supra) is also a decision of the IPAB,
Chennai dealing with the mark ‗TENOREX' and ‗TENORMIN'. ‗TENOREX' was not
permitted to be registered on the opposition of the proprietor of the mark
‗TENORMIN' on the ground of deceptive and phonetic similarity which was likely
to cause confusion. We find that though the argument of publici juris in
respect of the FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 46 of 64 prefix ‗TENOR'
did arise, the same was not gone into by the Appellate Board. Consequently,
this decision does not help the appellants.

80\. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited (supra) is a decision of the Gujarat High
Court dealing with the mark ‗TROVIREX', which was objected to by the
proprietor of the mark ‗ZOVIREX'. The registration of ‗TROVIREX' was denied on
the ground that ‗TROVIREX' had the highest degree of resemblance, visually and
phonetically and the same was likely to deceive or cause confusion in the
minds of the purchasers of the drug. The Gujarat High Court does not appear to
have gone into the issue of publici juris in respect of the concerned active
chemical compound, disease, organ on the basis of which the drug ‗ZOVIREX'
might have been named. This judgment is, therefore, of no assistance to the
appellants.

81\. Ranbaxy Laboratories (supra) is also a case decided by the IPAB, Chennai.
The trademark under examination was ‗LEVASOL', in respect whereof opposition
was filed by the proprietor of the trademark ‗LEMASOL'. ‗LEVASOL' was a
veterinary medicine, whereas ‗LEMASOL' was a pharmaceutical preparation for
human use. The IPAB held that there was phonetic and visual identity, inasmuch
as, for the letter ‗M' in the objector's drug, the letter ‗V' had been
substituted by the applicant. The drug of both the parties fell within the
same class 5 and the distribution channel of the goods being the same, there
was likelihood of confusion. This case also does not throw any light on the
FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 47 of 64 generic chemically active
compound on which either of the two drugs were based. It has absolutely no
relevance to the cases in hand.

82\. Allergen Inc. v. Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (supra) is the
decision of the Calcutta High Court. The suit had been filed alleging passing
off of the ophthalmic solution under the trademark name ‗OCUFLOX'. The
defendant was also marketing its product, which could be used both for
treatment of eyes as well as ears with the same tradename ‗OCUFLOX'. It was
for this reason, the Court had granted the injunction. This case, therefore,
has absolutely no bearing on the present appeals.

83\. Allergen Inc. v. Chetana Pharmaceuticals (supra) is a case decided by the
Calcutta High Court in respect of the trademark ‗OXYLINE'. The plaintiff was
the proprietor of the said mark in relation to a drug for ophthalmic use. The
defendant used the identical mark in relation to its drug i.e. nasal drops.
Since the marks were identical, injunction followed. This case too has no
bearing on the issue in hand.

84\. Remidex Pharma Private Ltd. (supra) is a decision of a learned Single
Judge of this Court. The competing marks were ‗ZEVIT' and ‗EVIT'. The
defendant had adopted ‗EVIT' in respect of its vitamin tablets. The defence of
the defendant was that the clipping ‗VIT' had been taken from word vitamin and
was, therefore, generic. Since the product of the defendant was vitamin E
tablets, the defendant claimed bonafide adoption of the mark ‗EVIT'. The
learned Single Judge while FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 48 of 64
confirming the injunction in favour of the plaintiff observed that on
comparison of ‗ZEVIT' with ‗EVIT', the prefixes ‗ZE' and ‗E' of ‗ZEVIT' and
‗EVIT', respectively, are phonetically similar. It was, on this account that
the Court held that the mark ‗EVIT' is deceptively similar to the registered
mark ‗ZEVIT' of the plaintiff. It is not that the Court proceeded on the basis
that the plaintiff had the right to appropriate to itself the generic and
phonetic term ‗VIT' derived from vitamin. Consequently, this case too does not
advance the case of the appellants.

85\. In Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals (supra) the Court was dealing with the
passing off action. The court found that there was phonetic and visual
similarity between ‗LIPITOR' and ‗LIPICOR', inasmuch as, only one letter i.e.
‗T' had been replaced by ‗C'. It was, on this account, that the Court had
granted the requisite injunction in favour of the plaintiff.

86\. In Heinz Italia & Anr. (supra) the Supreme Court was dealing with the
marks ‗GLUCON-D' of the appellant/plaintiff and ‗GLUCOSE-D' of the
respondent/defendant. The injunction granted in this case was, again, not
founded upon the recognition of any exclusive right of the plaintiff to
appropriate the word ‗GLUCOSE' which is generic. The injunction was granted on
the basis that ‗GLUCON-D' and ‗GLUCOSE-D' appear to have phonetic similarity.
The color scheme in the packaging of the two competing products was also found
to be more or less identical. The court found that the packaging FAO (OS)
Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 49 of 64 and getup of the two competing products
was almost identical. It was on this basis that the injunction was granted.

87\. The decision in Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd. (supra) is also of no use
to the appellants. The court while recognizing the legal principle that a
party cannot have any monopoly right to use a generic word, concluded in the
facts of that case that the plaintiff had not used a generic word and on that
basis the defence of the defendant was rejected in respect of the defendant's
marks ‗ODOJA' in comparison with the plaintiff's registered trademarks
‗ODONIL', ‗ODOPIC' and ‗ODOMOS'. The Court held that ‗ODO' was an adoption
and/or coinage of the plaintiff and was not a dictionary word. Consequently,
the court, in fact, rejected the argument that ‗ODO' was publici juris for
‗ODOUR'. This case too has no application in the facts of the present cases.

88\. Syncom Formulations (India) Ltd. (supra) was a case of passing off in
respect of the plaintiff's trademark ‗REGULIN FORTE' by the defendant who
adopted the mark ‗REGU-30'. This Court dismissed the first appeal preferred by
the defendant against the grant of injunction by the Trial Court in favor of
the plaintiff. In the facts of that case the Court found that the mark of the
defendant was confusing and deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff and
the product of the defendant could be passed off as that of the plaintiff.
This case also has absolutely no bearing on the present appeals.

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 50 of 64

89\. The decision in Ciba Geigy Ltd.(supra), in our view, is also of no
assistance to the appellants, as this case proceeded on the foundation that
the medicine vendor may not know the difference, and he may unknowingly give
the product of the defendant (‗VOLTA-K' in this case) in place of the product
of the plaintiff i.e. ‗VOLTAREN'. In the facts of the present cases,
considering the nature of the drug, the warning endorsed on the drugs of the
respondents, and the price difference in the drugs of the appellants on the
one hand and those of the respondents on the other hand, in our view, there is
no scope for any such confusion, and this decision has no bearing on the
present appeals.

90\. Corn Products Refining Co. (supra) was a case where the Supreme Court was
concerned with the claim for registration made in respect of the mark
‗GLUVITA' in respect of the biscuits made by the respondent. The appellant
before the Supreme Court had got the mark ‗GLUCOVITA' registered in respect of
‗DEXTROSE', a substance used as food or as an ingredient in food; glucose and
food. This is not a decision dealing with medicines/drugs. The relief granted
to the appellant in the said case was primarily founded upon the similarity in
the marks in question namely ‗GLUVITA' and ‗GLUCOVITA'. The letters `CO' alone
had been dropped by the respondent from the mark of the appellant to coin the
mark `GLUVITA'. It does not advance the submission of the appellants, as the
ratio of this decision is not to the effect that the word fragment of a
generic/publici juris word can be FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 51 of
64 appropriated by the person who may have used the word fragment as a part of
a descriptive trademark.

91\. The State of Maharashtra v. Jethmal Himatmal Jain (supra) is not a case
dealing with infringement of trademark or even with passing off. The same is,
therefore, of no relevance whatsoever.

92\. The appellants have relied upon the decision Plastindia Foundation
(supra) in support of their submission that a word fragment of a word that is
generic/publici juris which is descriptive of certain goods, can and does
sometimes acquire distinctiveness as a source que for those goods. In
Plastindia Foundation (supra) the plaintiff had adopted the name ‗Plastindia
Foundation' for its trust, which was an apex body of associations of all the
leading organizations and institutes concerned, directly or indirectly, with
the manufacture, sale or promotion of plastics in India. The defendant adopted
the same mark ‗PlastIndia' for their magazine. The court granted an injunction
in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant from using the said mark
on the basis that the adoption of ‗PlastIndia' by the defendant may lead to
the confusion that the magazine ‗PlastIndia' has its source at, or that it has
connection with Plastindia Foundation i.e. the plaintiff.

93\. We do not see the relevance of this decision in the present context.
Plastindia was a coined word derived from generic words Plastic and India. The
Court did not hold that the Plaintiff alone was entitled to appropriate
‗Plast' or ‗India', which are publici juris/generic. FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 52 of 64 Pertinently, the Court permitted the defendant to use,
inter alia, ―PLAST WORLD‖ and ―WORLD PLAST‖. It follows that others too would
be entitled to use these generic and descriptive words. However, that does not
mean that another person can use the identical or deceptively similar
name/mark which is likely to cause confusion and deception. Because the Court
found that the defendants mark was more or less identical with that of the
plaintiff, and could lead to confusion and deception with regard to the source
of the defendants' magazine, the Court granted the injunction in favour of the
plaintiff. Pertinently, this is also not a case relating to drugs.

94\. TEMOZOLOMIDE is a generic word. TEM/TEMO, as we have already seen, is
publici juris for TEMOZOLOMIDE. TEM/TEMO is not generic for the trademarks
‗TEMODAL' and ‗TEMODAR' of the appellant, but for TEMOZOLOMIDE. The use of
TEM/TEMO in TEMODAL/TEMODAR is descriptive of ‗TEMOZOLOMIDE'. The use of the
marks TEMOKEM and TEMOGET by the respondents, therefore, possibly cannot lead
to the inference that TEMOKEM and TEMOGET have been sourced from the
manufacturers of TEMODAL and TEMODAR i.e. from the appellants. Such a
conclusion is also contra-indicated by the vast difference in price of the
products of the appellants and the respondents.

95\. The SUPERFLAME case (Globe Super Parts v. Blue Super Flame Industries AIR
1986 DELHI 245) was a passing off action by the plaintiff who was the
proprietor of the unregistered mark FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 53
of 64 ―SUPERFLAME‖. The defendants were using the mark ―SUPERFLAME‖ for the
same articles, namely, gas appliances. The Court held that the mark
―SUPERFLAME‖ was a coined word. It was held that ―SUPERFLAME‖ was not
descriptive of gas stoves. For this reason, the Court granted permanent
injunction to restrain the defendants from using the word ―SUPERFLAME‖, as the
plaintiff was the prior user of the said coined word. Such is not the claim in
the present appeals.

96\. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. v. Reddy Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2004 (29) PTC
435 (Del) was a case of passing off. The Court came to the conclusion that the
adoption of the mark ―REDDY‖ by the defendant was fraudulent to encash upon
the trade reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff built over two decades. The
Court found that there was phonetic similarity between ―DR. REDDY‖ and ―REDDY‖
capable of creating confusion. The Court also found deceptive similarity in
the names and packaging of the drugs of the defendant with those of the
plaintiff. It is for this reason that the Court had granted injunction. The
Court did not declare that ―REDDY‖ could not be used by another person by that
name bonafide, even if such user is not deceptively similar to that of the
plaintiffs. This case, therefore, has no relevance in the present context.

97\. Ayurherbs Pharmaceuticals Private Limited v. Three-N- Products Private
Limited 2007 (35) PTC 261 (Del) was a case where the plaintiff, the proprietor
of the mark ―AYUR‖ initiated an action against the defendant, who had adopted
a business/tradename FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 54 of 64 ―Ayurherbs
Pharmaceuticals Private Limited". The defendant was also in the same trade,
namely, manufacture and sale of ayurvedic products, as the plaintiff, who was
selling its ayurvedic products under the trademark ―AYUR‖. The Court dismissed
the defendant's first appeal against the grant of injunction by the trial
Court, on the premise that the use of the name ―AYUR‖ by the appellant is
likely to cause confusion in the mind of the ordinary purchaser and,
consequently, it was held that the adoption of the name ―AYUR‖ by the
appellant in its trade name amounts to passing off. In this case the Court did
not hold that ―AYUR‖ was publici juris for ayurveda or that the plaintiff was
exclusively entitled to appropriate to itself the use of the generic term
ayurveda or its abbreviation ―AYUR‖.

98\. The second ‗Ayur' case reported as Three-N-Products Private Ltd. v.
Karnataka Soaps & Detergents Ltd. & Anr. 2007 (34) PTC 515 (Cal) was also a
passing off action. As the plaintiff was the prior user of ―AYUR‖, the
defendant was injuncted from using the said mark for soaps. This case too is
of no relevance for our purpose.

99\. In Indo Edge (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Shailesh Gupta & Anr. 2002 (24)
PTC 355 (Del) the plaintiff had developed the domain name ―NAUKRI.COM‖ used to
provide job placement services and employment with the peculiarity that the
plaintiff had adopted a Hindi word with English script. It was held on the
basis of press reports and write ups that the domain name of the plaintiff is
unique and distinct which has a distinctive character and which has assumed a
reputation FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 55 of 64 in the market. The
defendant, who had a similar business with the domain name
―jobsourceindia.com‖, had also adopted ―naukari.com‖. The Court held that ―If
a product of a particular character or composition is marketed in a particular
area or place under a descriptive name and gained a reputation thereunder,
that name which distinguished if from competing products of different
composition, the goodwill in the name of those entitled to make use of it
there was protected against deceptive use there of the name by competitors‖.
The Court referred to McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition Vol.2, 3rd
Edition, wherein in para 12.5(2) it was stated that in order to obtain some
form of relief on a ―passing off‖ claim, the user of the generic terms must
prove some false or confusing usage by the newcomer above and beyond mere us
of generic name. The only difference between the plaintiff's and the
defendant's domain names was the insertion of the letter ‗A' between the
letters ‗K' and ‗R' in the word ―Naukri‖. It was further held that even if
―Naukri‖ is assumed to be a generic word, the adoption of a similar mark by
the defendant, when the plaintiff's mark had attained distinctiveness and was
associated with the business of the plaintiff for a considerable time, was
dishonest and in bad faith. It is for these reasons that the Court had granted
the injunction in favour of the plaintiff. In our view, this decision does not
advance the case of the appellants, as, in our opinion, the marks of the
appellants on the one hand and those of the respondents on the other hand are
not phonetic and visually similar.

100\. In Cadila Health Care Ltd. V. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) the
two competing trademarks were ‗FALCIGO' of the plaintiff and ‗FALCITAB' of the
defendant. Both the drugs were meant to cure cerebral malaria commonly known
as ―falcipharum‖. The drugs were schedule ‗L' drugs which means, that the
drugs were not at all available for sale in retail and could be supplied only
to hospitals and clinics. Consequently, there was even stricter regime for the
sale of such drugs when compared to Schedule ‗H' drugs. There was also
substantial price difference in the two drugs. The Trial Court as well as the
High Court (in First Appeal) found that the packaging and getup of the two
products was not deceptively similar or confusing. The extra Assistant Judge,
Vadodra declined the interim injunction sought by the plaintiff. This order
was upheld in First Appeal. The Supreme Court also declined to interfere with
the order. The reasons given by the Supreme Court for its decision, and the
principles to be kept in mind while dealing with an action for infringement or
passing off, specifically in the cases relating to medical products, were
subsequently set out by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment. The Court
did not grant the interim injunction for the reason that it felt that there
was possibility of evidence being required on merits of the case. The Court
felt that expression of opinion on merits of the case by the Supreme Court at
the interlocutory stage would not be advisable.

101\. In the above decision, the action was brought by the plaintiff alleging
passing off. It appears that the same was not an action for FAO (OS)
Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 57 of 64 infringement of trademark under Section
29 of the Act. The Supreme Court in this decision overruled its earlier
decision in S. M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. (2000) 5 SCC 573 in so
far as it has been held in S.M. Dyechem (supra) ―Where common marks are
included in the rival trade marks, more regard is to be paid to the parts not
common and the proper course is to look at the marks as whole, but at the same
time not to disregard the parts which are common.‖ The Supreme Court held that
"............the decisions in the last four decades have clearly laid down
that what has to be seen in the case of a passing off action is the similarity
between the competing marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of
deception or causing confusion............Having come to the conclusion, in
our opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential features is
relevant, this Court in Dyechem case (supra) sought to examine the difference
in the two marks "PIKNIK" and "PICNIC"......................‖.

102\. The Supreme Court then proceeded to refer to American Court's decisions
relating to medicinal products. In paragraphs 35 and 36 the Supreme Court laid
down the factors to be considered by the Court in an action for passing off on
the basis of unregistered trademark. The said paragraphs reads as follows:

> ―35. Broadly stated in an action for passing off on the basis of
> unregistered trade mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive
> similarity the following factors to be considered:

FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 58 of 64

> a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label
> marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label works.

> b) The degree of resemble ness between the marks, phonetically similar and
> hence similar in idea.

> c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.

> d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of
> the rival traders.

> e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks
> they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they
> are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.

> f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods and

> g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent
> of dissimilarity between the competing marks.

> 36\. Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depends upon
> facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in
> every case.‖

103\. As we have already noticed, the present is an action for infringement
under Section 29 of the Act and not an action for passing off. In any event,
on consideration of the various factors set out by the Supreme Court, as
aforesaid, to us it is clear that keeping in view the nature of the marks-
which are word marks; the lack of resemblance between the marks-phonetic or
otherwise; the fact that the word fragment ‗TEMO' is publici juris for the
generic term TEMOZOLOMIDE, which is the active ingredient in the appellants
drugs and the use of FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 59 of 64 ‗TEMO' is,
therefore, descriptive; the fact that the appellants cannot appropriate to
themselves the exclusive use of a generic term which is publici juris and
descriptive; the fact that the drugs in question are Schedule-H drugs and that
there are vast price differences, we are of the view that the injunction
earlier granted in favour of the appellants in the two cases have rightly been
vacated by the learned Single Judge.

104\. Learned counsel for the appellants has also sought to urge that the
trademarks of the appellants are valid, and the respondents have not
challenged the registration of the appellants' marks by seeking rectification.

105\. The issue before us is not with regard to the validity of the
appellants' trademarks TEMODAL and TEMODAR. Merely because the said trademarks
may be valid and legally registered and their registrations may not contravene
Section 9 of the Act, it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the
appellants would be entitled to claim proprietary over a word fragment of
their marks, particularly when the said word fragment is publici juris for a
generic compound TEMOZOLOMIDE, and is used descriptively for the active
chemical compound in the appellants products and is descriptive in nature.

106\. Mr. Datta submits that the appellants would fail in their action only if
the appellants trademarks are a trivial modification of the word TEMOZOLOMIDE;
the appellants' trademarks are obtained by FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008
Page 60 of 64 elision of a single syllable from the word TEMOZOLOMIDE; the
appellants' trademarks are substantially identical to the word TEMOZOLOMIDE;
the appellants' trademarks are legal equivalent of the word TEMOZOLOMIDE.

107\. These may be some of the grounds for the appellants to fail in their
action against the respondents, but these are not the only grounds why the
Court would deny interim relief of injunction in cases like these. For the
appellants to succeed, they must also establish that the respondents have no
right to use the generic name/abbreviation of the compound ‗TEMOZOLOMIDE' in
their drugs, and that the appellants have an exclusive right in this regard.
This, unfortunately for the appellants, they have failed to show. In our view,
for the appellants to fail it is enough that the appellants' trademark have
been coined by combining the publici juris abbreviation TEM/TEMO for
TEMOZOLOMIDE with the suffix ‗DAL' in one case and ‗DAR' in the other case,
the marks of the appellants are descriptive, and the marks of the respondents
do not bear phonetic or visual similarity which could be said to be deceptive
or confusing for the purchasers of the drugs in question.

108\. The registration of the appellants marks is in respect of TEMODAL and
TEMODAR. By virtue of Section 17 of the Act, it is the said marks and not
parts of the said marks, which stand protected. Consequently, TEM/TEMO cannot
be claimed to enjoy protection by virtue of Section 17 of the Act. Section 17
of the Act confers on the proprietor the exclusive right to the use of the
trademark as a whole. FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 61 of 64 It
provides: "Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) when a
trademark contains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of
a non-distinctive character, the registration thereof shall not confer any
exclusive right in the matter forming only a part of the whole of the
trademark so registered" (See Section 17 (2) (b)).

109\. The packaging in which the products of the appellants, namely, ‗TEMODAL'
is marketed and the products of the respondents' ALKEM and GETWELL are
marketed, have been placed on record. ‗TEMODAL' is marketed in 20 mg tablets,
each bottle containing 5 tablets. On the other hand ‗TEMOKEM' is marketed in
an aluminum strip of five tablets and the potency of the tablets is 100 mg.
There is absolutely no similarity in the getup of the packaging adopted by the
appellants and the respondents. Similarly, ‗TEMOGET' is sold in an aluminum
strip of five capsules of either 20 mg or 250 mg. The colour of the capsules
of the appellants is green for the 5 mg capsule, brown for the 20 mg capsule,
blue for the 100 mg capsule and black for the 250 mg capsule. The product of
the respondent GETWELL is sold in capsules of 20 mg of blue colour, 100 mg in
while colour and 250 mg in green colour. Therefore, there is no similarity in
the getup of either the packaging or the product itself.

110\. In our view, the factors that the products of the respondent contain the
warning ―To be supplied against demand from cancer hospitals, institutions and
against a prescription of a cancer patient only" and the huge price difference
(about 600%) in the product of the FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 & 314/2008 Page 62 of
64 appellants on the one hand, and the respondents on the other hand, are
extremely germane considerations to rule out the possibility of any confusion
or deception in the minds of the purchasers of the drugs in question.

111\. The drugs of the respondents can be bought only against prescriptions
from cancer hospitals, institutions and cancer specialists and not otherwise.
The appellants have not produced any credible material to show actual
confusion or that their product is, in any way, superior to that of the
respondents which could be relied upon at this stage of the proceedings.

112\. The aforesaid trademarks cannot be deciphered or considered separately
i.e. by fragmenting them, but must be taken as a whole. But even if they are
taken as a whole, the prefix TEMO used with suffix KEM and GET in the two
competing names distinguish and differentiate the products of the appellants
from those of the two respondents. When they are taken as a whole, the
aforesaid two trademarks of the two respondents cannot be said to be either
phonetically or visually or in any manner deceptively similar to the
trademarks of the appellants i.e TEMODAL and TEMODAR.

113\. The common feature in the competing marks i.e. TEMO is only descriptive
and publici juris and, therefore, the customers would tend to ignore the
common feature and would pay more attention to FAO (OS) Nos.313/2008 &
314/2008 Page 63 of 64 the uncommon feature. Even if they are expressed as a
whole, the two do not have any phonetic similarity to make them objectionable.

114\. Consequently, we find no infirmity with the findings arrived at by the
learned Single Judge at this stage. The learned Single Judge was justified in
not continuing the temporary injunction in favour of the
appellants/plaintiffs. We, therefore, dismiss these appeals but with no orders
as to costs. However, we direct the respondents Alkem and Getwell in the two
appeals to maintain detailed accounts of the sales of their respective drugs
‗TEMOKEM' and ‗TEMOGET' and to regularly file half yearly statements in the
suit, till the disposal of the suit. It goes without saying that any
observation made by us on the merits of the cases of either party is only
tentative, and the learned Single Judge shall decide all issues arising in the
suit without being influenced one way or another by our said findings.
