Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.

1\. Leave granted.

2\. These appeals are filed against the final judgment and order dated
13.02.2017 in APOT No.274 of 2016 and dated 02.05.2017 in RVWO Signature Not
Verified No.16 of 2017 passed by the High Court at Calcutta Digitally signed
by ASHOK RAJ SINGH Date: 2019.03.07 17:29:14 IST Reason:

1 whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal and review petition filed by the
appellant herein.

3\. These appeals involve a short point as would be clear from the facts
stated infra.

4\. The appellant is the plaintiff whereas the respondents are the defendants
in a civil suit out of which these appeals arise.

5\. The appellant filed a civil suit (Civil Suit No.88/2016) against the
respondents for a declaration, damages and for grant of injunction etc. in the
High Court at Calcutta on its original side.

6\. The suit was filed inter alia for a declaration that the termination of
two agreements dated 11.07.2007 and 21.05.2008 made by respondent No.1 was
wrongful and, therefore, both the agreements be declared as being bad in law.
The  2 other reliefs claimed in the suit were consequential in nature to the
main relief.

7\. The appellant (plaintiff) also filed an application and sought leave to
file the civil suit as required under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent Act,
1865\. The Single Judge by order dated 18.03.2016 granted leave to the
appellant as prayed for.

8\. The respondents, on entering their appearance in the suit, filed an
application and prayed therein for revocation of the leave granted to the
appellant (plaintiff) for filing a civil suit by order dated 18.03.2016.

9\. The respondents­defendants, in substance, sought revocation of leave on
the ground that since no part of cause of action arose within the territorial
jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court but it arose at Bangalore and hence
the civil suit could not have been filed in Calcutta High Court for want of  3
territorial jurisdiction. It was, therefore, prayed that the leave granted to
the appellant to file and prosecute the civil suit in the Calcutta High
Court(original side) is liable to be revoked.

10\. The appellant (plaintiff) also filed their reply and contested the said
application. By order dated 28.07.2016, the Single Judge allowed the
application of the respondents(defendants) and revoked the leave. The
appellant felt aggrieved and filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the
High Court. By impugned order, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal and
affirmed the order of the Single Judge, which has given rise to filing of this
appeal by way of special leave by the appellant(plaintiff) in this Court.

11\. So, the short question, which arises for consideration in this appeal, is
whether the High Court (Single Judge and Division Bench) was  4 justified in
allowing the respondents’ (defendants’) application and thereby was justified
in revoking the leave granted to the appellant (plaintiff) by order dated
18.03.2016.

12\. Heard Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, learned senior counsel for the appellant and
Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel and Mr. Rajesh Singh Chauhan, learned
counsel for the respondents.

13\. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the
record of the case including the written submissions filed by the parties, we
are inclined to allow these appeals and while setting aside the impugned order
and the order of the Single Judge dated 28.07.2016, remand the case to the
Single Judge for deciding the issue in question afresh in accordance with law
as directed hereinbelow.

14\. The question arose as far back as in the year 1932 before the Calcutta
High Court in the case of Secretary of State vs. Golabrai Paliram (AIR 1932
Calcutta 146) as to how the Court should approach the application for
revocation of leave when it filed in a civil suit.

15\. Justice Rankin, learned the then Chief Justice, laid down the following
principle of law in the case while answering this question in the following
words at page 147:

> “I do really protest against questions of difficulty and importance being
> dealt with by an application to revoke the leave under clause 12 of the
> Letters Patent and to take the plaint off the file. Normally it is well
> settled that the proper way to plead to the jurisdiction of the court is to
> take the plea in the written statement and as a substantive part of the
> defence. Except in the clearest cases that should be the course.”

16\. This question came up for consideration before this Court in Indian
Mineral & Chemicals Co. & Ors. vs. Deutsche Bank [(2004) 12 SCC 376]. The  6
learned Judge Ruma Paul J. speaking for the Bench in Para 15 approved the law
laid down in Secretary of State (supra) as laying down the correct principle
of law and observed as under:

> “15. The observations of Rankin, C.J. in Secy. of State v. Golabrai Paliram
> correctly represents the law as to how the Court should approach an
> application for revocation of leave: (AIR p. 147) “I do really protest
> against questions of difficulty and importance being dealt with by an
> application to revoke the leave under clause 12 of the Letters Patent and to
> take the plaint off the file. Normally it is well settled that the proper
> way to plead to the jurisdiction of the court is to take the plea in the
> written statement and as a substantive part of the defence. Except in the
> clearest cases that should be the course.”

17\. In other words, the law laid down in Secretary of State (supra) by the
Calcutta High Court is now the law laid down by this Court in view of its  7
affirmation by this Court in Indian Mineral & Chemicals Co. (supra).

18\. Coming now to the facts of this case, since in this case the respondents
did not file any written statement and instead raised the plea of territorial
jurisdiction by filing the application for revocation of leave, in our view,
the High Court should not have entertained the said application and instead
should have granted liberty to the respondents(defendants) to file the written
statement in the suit and to raise therein a plea of territorial jurisdiction
of the Court.

19\. An issue of such nature, in our view, cannot be tried by filing an
application for revocation of leave. Indeed, this is what Rankin, the then
CJ., held for the Bench in Secretary of State (supra) and which received
approval of this Court in Indian Mineral & Chemicals Co.(supra).

8

20\. In our opinion, a plea of territorial jurisdiction is essentially a mixed
question of law and fact. It is for this reason, the respondents(defendants)
should be allowed to raise such plea in the written statement to enable the
Court to try it on its merits in accordance with law in the light of the
requirements of Order 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and other
relevant provisions governing the issue on merits.

21\. Learned counsel for the respondents cited several decisions in support of
his submissions. Having gone through them, we are of the opinion that these
decisions are distinguishable in the light of the law laid down by this Court
in Indian Mineral & Chemicals Co. (supra).

22\. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we allow the appeals, set aside
the impugned orders as also the order of the Single Judge dated 28.07.2016  9
and while dismissing the application filed by the respondents (defendants) for
revocation of grant of leave, grant liberty to them to file their written
statement in answer to the plaint and raise therein the plea in question along
with all other pleas relating to the facts and law as the case may be.

23\. On such written statement being filed, the Single Judge will frame
appropriate issues arising in the suit and proceed to answer them in
accordance with law keeping in view the procedure laid down in Order 14 of the
Code of Civil Procedure.

24\. We, however, make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the
merits of the controversy having formed an opinion to remand the case to the
Single Judge for deciding the issue afresh as directed above.

25\. The Single Judge of the High Court will accordingly decide the issue
strictly in accordance  10 with law on its merits without being influenced by
any observations made by him, the Division Bench in the impugned order and
this Court.
