    B.N. KIRPAL & S. RAJENDRA BABU
    
    JUDGMENT:
    

JUDGMENT 2000 (1) SCR 26 The following Order of the Court was delivered :

It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that redemption fine
could not be imposed because the goods were no loger in the custody of the
respondent-authority. It is an admitted fact that the goods were released to
the appellant on an application made by it and on the appellant executing a
bond. Under these circumstances if subsequently it is found that the import
was not valid or that there was any other irregularity which would entitle the
customs authorities to confiscate the said goods, then the mere fact that the
goods were released on the bond being executed would not take away the power
of the customs authorities to levy redemption fine.

The appeal is dismissed.
