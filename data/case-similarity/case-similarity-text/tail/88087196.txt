District and Sessions Judge, Ahmadabad (Gujarat) for the plaint to be
presented in that jurisdictional court for further proceedings in accordance
with law.
30\. Since this court is of the view that the case at hand was wrongly
instituted here and that the court at Ahmadabad (Gujarat) would be the
appropriate court of jurisdiction, it being the principal place of business of
the plaintiffs (as indeed of the defendants) as also the place where the cause
of action has arisen and consequently the plaint is liable to be returned in
terms of Rule 10 of Order VII CPC, the plaintiffs, through counsel, was
informed accordingly, in response to which the learned counsel submitted that
the plaintiff does not wish to avail of the provision contained in Rule 10A of
Order VII CPC for the plaint to be returned so as to be presented again in the
court referred to earlier. In this view, no opportunity for moving an
application under Order 7 Rule 10 A (2) CPC having been sought or availed by
the plaintiff, it is directed that the plaint be returned under Order VII Rule
10 CPC for being presented to the appropriate court of jurisdiction.
31\. Interim orders passed by this court earlier are vacated. The proceedings
in the suit and the applications filed therein in this court stand disposed of
in above terms.
