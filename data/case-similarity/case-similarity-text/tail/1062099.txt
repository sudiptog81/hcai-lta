42\. For the reasons stated in the aforesaid discussion, the appeals are
partly allowed. The High Court has already granted interim relief to the
plaintiff- appellants by directing that though the respondent- defendants
shall be entitled to sell their CD-ROMS with the text of the judgments of the
Supreme Court along with their own head notes, editorial notes, if any, they
should not in any way copy the head notes of the plaintiff-appellants; and
that the defendant-respondents shall also not copy the footnotes and editorial
notes appearing in the journal of the plaintiff-appellants. It is further
directed by us that the defendant-respondents shall not use the paragraphs
made by the appellants in their copy-edited version for internal references
and their editors judgment regarding the opinions expressed by the Judges by
using phrases like `concurring, `partly dissenting, etc. on the basis of
reported judgments in SCC. The judgment of the High Court is modified to the
extent that in addition to the interim relief already granted by the High
Court, we have granted the above-mentioned additional relief to the
appellants.
43\. In view of the decision rendered by us in the civil appeals, we do not
think it necessary to pass any order on the contempt petition. The contempt
petition stands disposed of accordingly.
44\. There shall be no order as to costs.
