product” as:
“a medicinal product which has the same qualitative and quantitative
composition in active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the
reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence with the reference
medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability
studies. The different salts, esters, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes
or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same
active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard
to safety and/or efficacy. In such cases, additional information providing
proof of the safety and/or efficacy of the various salts, esters or
derivatives of a authorized active substance must be supplied by the
applicant.” He pointed out that the expressions used in a different context in
the European Drug Regulatory Directive were incorporated in the Patents Act
for an altogether different purpose and raised some important and interesting
points for interpretation of section 3(d) but in this case we see no reason to
go into those aspects of the matter. [52] 42 FR 1640 (1977). Cf. Moffitt,
