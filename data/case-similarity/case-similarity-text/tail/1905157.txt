For all the reasons aforesaid, we have no hesitation in holding that the
learned Judges of the Appellate Bench were in error in reversing the findings
of the trial Court on Issues 1 and 1-A. The learned trial Judge was right in
holding that the patented machine was neither a manner of new manufacture or
novel improvement, nor did it involve any inventive step, having regard to
what was publicly known or used at the date of the patent. The grant of the
patent in question was therefore, invalid and was liable to be revoked on the
grounds mentioned in Clauses (d) and (e) of Section 26(1) of the Act.
Before parting with this judgment, we will like to dispose of another argument
of Mr. Mehta. The argument is that since the Courts below have concurrently
held that the invention had utility, the patent should be sustained. We are
unable to accept this contention. As pointed out already, the crucial test of
the validity of a patent is whether it in voices novelty and an 'inventive
step' ? That test goes against the patentee.
In the result, the appeals are allowed, the judgment of the Appellate Bench is
set aside and that of the trial Court restored. In the peculiar circumstances
of the case, the parties are left to bear their own costs throughout.
