contract cannot be permitted to raise this grievance.
Shri Shanti bhushan has lastly urged that the interim injuction granted by the
High Court is in very wide terms because not only GBC but also those to whom
the shares have been sold and also subsewquent trnasferees, their servants,
agents nominees, employees, subsidiary companies. controlled companies.
affiliates or associte companies or any person acting for and on their behalfd
are restrained by the interim injuction from using the plants of GBC. It is no
doubt true that the interim injuction is widely worded to cover the persons
aforementioned but in its operation the order only restrains them from using
the plants of GBC at Ahmedabad anbd RAjkot for manufacturing, bottling or
selling or dealing with or concerning in any manner whatsoever with the
beverages of any person till January 25, 1996, the expiry of the period of one
year from the date of notice dated January 25, 1995. The interim injuction is
thus confined to the use of the plants at Ahmedabad and Rajkot by any of these
persons and it is in consonance with the negative stipulation contained in
paragraph 14 of the agreement dated September 20, 1993.
For the reasons aforementioned we do not find any infirmity in the impugned
order of the high Court dated March 31, 1995 granting an interim injuction in
terms of prayers (a) (ii) and (a) (iii) of the Notice of motion as amended.
The appeals, therefore, fail and are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
