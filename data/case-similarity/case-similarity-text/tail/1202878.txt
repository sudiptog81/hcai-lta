therefore, order accordingly.
Lastly, it is urged on behalf of the respondents that as all the workmen
concerned were taken back in service they should be paid full wages for the
interim period as their re-employment means that the decision to dismiss them
and the consequent order of suspension were waived. This is a matter on which
we do not propose to express any opinion. The proceedings are so far at the
initial stage and the effect of re-empolyment, in the absence of full facts,
on the question of waiver cannot be determined at this stage. It is enough to
point out that the order we have passed above is an interim relief and it will
be liable to be modified one way or the other, when the Industrial Tribunal
proceeds to make the final determination of the questions referred to it in
the light of the observations we have made on the matter of suspension. The
appeals are partly allowed and the order dated December, 5, 1955, granting
interim relief is modified in the manner indicated above. In the
circumstances, we order the parties to bear their own costs of this Court. As
more than three years have gone by in these preliminaries since the references
were made, we trust that the Industrial Tribunal will now dispose of the
matter as expeditiously as possible.
Appeals allowed in part.
