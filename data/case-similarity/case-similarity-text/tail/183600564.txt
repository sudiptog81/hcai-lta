further, that the admissibility of evidence is dependent on receipt of further
evidence. This Court is of the view that in the interest of justice, the said
objections can be taken at the time of final arguments. Even for the sake of
argument, inadmissible documents were received in evidence, subject to
objections, still, it is open to the Court to eschew those documents for
consideration, and give a decision based on the quality of evidence tendered
by the respective parties.
35.In the light of the factual aspect coupled with the legal position, except
the objections raised by the applicant/defendant with regard to the marking of
photocopies of certain documents and clippings of newspapers and press
reports, the rest of the objections with regard to the marking of other
documents, can be decided at the time of final arguments to be advanced by the
respective parties.
36.In the result, both the applications are disposed of accordingly.
37.The objections with regard to the receipt of photocopies of certain
documents as well as clippings of newspapers and press reports, can be taken
up for consideration by this Court before directing the learned Commissioner
to proceed further with the recording of evidence. Call the suit on 20.4.2016.
