This Court in Municipal Corporation vs. Sri Niyamatullah S/o Masitulla 1970 2
SCR 47 interpreted Section 135(2) of the Indore Municipal Act, 1909 which is
similar to Section 253(a) of the Act in the following term:
> "The provisions contained in section 135 of the Indore Municipal Act will be
> applicable to things done under the Act. It is manifest that in the present
> case the order of dismissal passed by Shri Ghatpande was beyond his
> jurisdiction and is therefore not an act done under the Act."
The dismissal order in the present case could only be passed by following the
procedure laid down under rule 35 of the Rules. The Municipal Board had no
jurisdiction or authority to dismiss the appellant without following the
mandatory procedure. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court was
not justified in reaching the conclusion that the order dismissing the
appellant was within the provisions of the Act. We allow the appeal, set aside
the impugned judgment of the High Court and decreed the suit of the appellant
with costs. We quantify the costs as Rs.20,000/-.
