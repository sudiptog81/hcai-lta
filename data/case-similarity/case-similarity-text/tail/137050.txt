> Register of Firms as partners in the firm."
In the present case the suit filed by the appellants is clearly hit by the
provisions of sub-section (2) of section 69 of the said Partnership Act, as on
the date when the suit was filed, two of the partners shown as partners as per
the relevant entries in the Register of Firms were not, in fact, partners, one
new partner had come in and two minors had been admitted to the benefit of the
partnership firm regard- ing which no notice was given to the Registrar of
Firms. Thus, the persons suing, namely, the current partners as on the date of
the suit were not shown as partners in the Register of Firms. The result is
that the suit was not maintainable in view of the provisions of sub-section
(2) of section 69 of the said Partnership Act and the view taken by the Trial
Court and confirmed by the High Court in this connection is correct. Although
the plaint was amended on a later date that cannot save the suit. Reference
has been made to some decisions in the judgment of the Trial Court; however,
we do not find it necessary to refer to any of them as the position in law, in
our opinion, is clear on a plain reading of sub-section (2) of section 69 of
the said Part- nership Act.
In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
    N.P.V.				      Appeal dismissed.
