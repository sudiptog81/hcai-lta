made on 27th November, 2004 i.e. after more than six years of communication of
the said order. Hence, it was clearly time barred.
16\. From the records, it appears that the appellate order passed on 31st
August, 1998 was communicated to the assessing authority vide Memo No. 2177
dated 5th November, 1998. The respondent obtained a certified copy of the same
in January, 1999. Memo No. 204 dated 6th August, 2003, as referred to by the
counsel for the State is the second time communication, which was only a
reminder. Thus, the appellate order having been communicated to the assessing
authority vide Memo No. 2177 dated 5th November, 1998 for the purposes of
limitation the period will start from 5th November, 1998 and will be complete
on 5th November, 2000 i.e. two years from the date of communication of such
order to the assessing authority. We accordingly hold that the assessment
order made after remand on 27th November, 2004 and the consequential demand of
notice raised in pursuance of such order of re- assessment, all dated 29th
November, 2004 are time-barred under Section 24 of the Bihar Finance Act.
17\. However, the contention of the respondent herein is that the assessment
should be directed to be completed on the basis that the rate of tax would be
8%. As at present advised, this Court need not go into the said question.
18\. Thus we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment. The appeal is
accordingly dismissed. No costs.
