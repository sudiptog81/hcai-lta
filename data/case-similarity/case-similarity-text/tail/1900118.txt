order under proviso (c) to Article 311(2).
In our view, this was not a case where there was no relevant material. The
Tribunal could not have substituted its own judgment for the satisfaction of
the President of India. The Tribunal is under a misapprehension when it holds
that if the respondent could be criminally prosecuted a Departmental Enquiry
could have been held on the basis of this same material. The respondent placed
reliance on the observations to this effect made by the Andhra Pradesh High
Court in B. Bhaskara Reddy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh (1981 (1) SLR 249.
The Tribunal has not noted that the material which was placed by the
Intelligence Bureau before the Advisory Committee and the President did not
relate merely to the assassination of the Prime Minister. It related to
various other activities of the respondent as well, which the authorities
considered as prejudicial to the security of the State. The fact that the
respondent was subsequently acquitted by this Court in the criminal trial will
not make any difference to the order which was passed by the President on the
totality of material which was before the authorities long prior to the
conclusion of the criminal trial.
The appeal is, therefore, allowed. The impunged order of the Tribunal is set
aside and the application filed by the respondent before the Tribunal is
dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.
