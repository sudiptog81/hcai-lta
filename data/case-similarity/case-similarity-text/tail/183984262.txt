clause (a), (b) and (c). I will confirm that as the final order on this Notice
of Motion.
43\. The Suit, in my view, will need to be registered in the Commercial
Division. The Registry will take the necessary steps in that regard acting on
an authenticated copy of this order.
44\. In view of the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 brought by
the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division & Commercial Appellate Division of
High Courts Act 2015, and in particular the amendments to Section 35 and 35A
of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, this would mean that costs would follow
the event, and an award of costs would have to be made against the Defendants.
The amended Act requires me to give reasons for not awarding costs and,
therefore, this: in view of the fair approach of Mr Tolia and Mr Soman
throughout, and noting they have argued their case with admirable economy of
time, I believe this is not a fit case for the award of costs.
