to the revenue and it is open to the revenue to invoke the bank guarantee and
demand payment thereon. The bank guarantee is security for the revenue, that
in the event the revenue succeeds its dues will be recoverable, being backed
by the guarantee of a bank. In the event, however unlikely, of the bank
refusing, to honour its guarantee it would be necessary for the revenue or,
where the bank guarantee is in favour of the principal administrative officer
of the court, that officer to file a suit against the bank for the amount due
upon the bank guarantee. The amount of the disputed tax or duty that is
secured by a bank guarantee cannot, therefore, be held to be paid to the
revenue. There is no question of its refund and Section 11-B is not attracted.
11\. We find, therefore, no merit in the review petition. We reiterate out
finding that the bank guarantees given by the appellants were not properly the
subject-matter of the writ petition before the High Court and the High Court
was in error in directing the appellants to renew the same. We reiterate 551
our direction to the first and second respondents forthwith to repay to the
State Bank of Patiala, Overseas Branch, Millar Gang, Ludhiana, the amount of
Rs 1, 18,00,000 collected upon the bank guarantees within two weeks.
12\. The review petition is dismissed. The first and second respondents shall
pay to the appellants costs quantified in the sum of Rs 5000.
13\. This order will also dispose of I.A. No. 3 in the appeal.
