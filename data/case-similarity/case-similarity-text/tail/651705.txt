counter-affidavit that this order had been approved on February 18, 1972. We
feel that the counter-affidavit produced in this Court in answer to the
challenge to the preventive detention of the detenu should contain all the
facts correctly and full disclosure must be made without any reservation. It
must be remembered that the personal liberty of an individual has been given
an honoured place in the fundamental rights which our Constitution has
jealously protected against illegal and arbitrary deprivation, and that this
Court has been entrusted with a duty and invested with a power to enforce that
fundamental right. It is, therefore, obligatory on the part of the State to
place before this Court all the relevant facts relating to the impugned
detention truly, clearly and with the utmost fairness. This Court normally
accepts without reservation the sworn affidavits by responsible officers on
the assumption that the facts stated therein are absolutely true and that
there is no misstatement or concealment of relevant facts. It is, therefore,
incumbent on the officer concerned swearing the counter-affidavit to take good
care to satisfy himself that what he states on oath is absolutely true
according to the record.
This petition fails and is dismissed.
    V.P.S.			   Petition dismissed.
