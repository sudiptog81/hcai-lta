flights can not be a ground to prevent the passengers on board from returning
to the airport lounge when there is a delay of more than two hours after
completion of boarding. While the guidelines issued by the DGCA cover the
responsibilities of the airlines, DGCA and other concerned authorities should
also specify the responsibilities of the airport and the ATC authorities to
ensure that no aircraft  41 remains on tarmac for more than three hours after
the boarding is closed and that if it has to so remain, then permit the
passengers to return to the airport lounge from the aircraft, till the
aircraft is ready to take off. DGCA shall also ensure that the conditions of
carriage of all airlines in India is in consonance with its Civil Aviation
Directives.
42\. In view of our findings, this appeal is allowed. The order of the
Permanent Lok Adalat affirmed by the High Court awarding damages and costs to
the respondent is set aside and the application of respondent for compensation
is rejected. We place on record, our appreciation for the assistance rendered
by Shri V. Giri, senior counsel, as amicus curiae.
