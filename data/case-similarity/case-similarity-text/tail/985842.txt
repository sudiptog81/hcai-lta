effect and retroactive operation, if any power in this behalf is contained in
the main act. Rule making power is a species of delegated legislation. A
delegatee therefor can make rules only within the four-corners thereof.
It is a fundamental rule of law that no statute shall be construed to have a
retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the
terms of the Act, or arises by necessary and distinct implication. [See West
v. Gwynne, (1911) 2 Ch. 1] A retrospective effect to an amendment by way of a
delegated legislation could be given, thus, only after coming into force of
sub-section (2A) of Section 64 of the Act and not prior thereto.
By reason of Note 2, certain rights were conferred. Although there lies a
distinction between vested rights and accrued rights as by reason of a
delegated legislation, a right cannot be taken away. The amendments carried
out in 1996 as also the subsequent amendments made prior to 2001, could not,
thus, have taken away the rights of the appellant with retrospective effect.
For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained
which is set aside accordingly. The appeals are allowed and the matter is
remitted to the Director of Industries to consider the matter afresh.
In view of our findings aforementioned no direction is required to be issued
in the writ petition filed by the appellants. The writ petition is disposed of
accordingly.
