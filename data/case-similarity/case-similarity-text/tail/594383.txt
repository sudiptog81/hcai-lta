authorities that the assessee was entitled to these patent rights, and no
investigation was permissible on that question in the High Court.
Suit No. 890 of 1946 was filed before the assessee was registered. By paying
to the Swiss Company the share of costs in that Suit No. 890 of 1946, the
assessee was not seeking to protect its trading interest.

We also agree with the High Court that it is not proved that the obligation of
the Swiss Company to pay a share of the costs ill Suit No. 890 of 1946
incurred by May and Baker was transmitted from Ciba (India) Ltd. to the
assessee. We are unable to agree with the contention of counsel for the
assessee that the Tribunal had found that liability of the Swiss Company in
regard to the payment of share of costs of May and Baker devolved upon the
assessee. The Tribunal has riot expressly so found and there is no evidence in
support of that view. In our view the High Court was right in answering the
second question against the assessee. Both the sets of appeals fail and are
dismissed with costs. One hearing fee in each set.
    V.P.S.						     Appeals
    dismissed.
