service in question could not be put to nay lawful use. Finally, when the
ultimate offence consists of a chain of actions, it would not be necessary for
the prosecution to establish, to bring home the charge of conspiracy, that
each of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do,
so long as it is known that the collaborator would put the goods or service to
an unlawful use." [Also see State of Kerala v. P.
Sugathan and Anr. (2000 (8) SCC page 203); and Devender Pal Singh v. State of
N.C.T. of Delhi and Anr. (2002 (5) SCC 234)] Even in the light of the
principles highlighted above when the evidence is tested, the inevitable
conclusion is that the trial Court was justified in holding that accusations
under Section 120B were not made out so far as the offences under IPC are
concerned. So far as the motive for the killing is concerned, the evidence is
clear to the extent that A-1 wanted removal of the deceased from the bodies of
various trusts and educational institutions and not his removal from this
world. In the absence of adequate material to establish commission of offences
punishable under Section 302 or 302 read with Section 120B and Section 3(3), 5
and 6 of TADA and Section 27 of the Arms Act, as rightly held to have been not
established by the trial Court, the appeals filed by the State and Balbir
Singh are without merit. In the ultimate, all the three appeals are without
merit and are dismissed.
