his award on January 31, 1986 under Section 11. On reference under section 18
at the instance of some claimants, the reference Court, by its award and
decree dated November 21, 1988, enhanced the compensation. The application
under Section 28-A was filed on October 1, 1991\. The written application can
be filed by some who had not sought the reference under Section 18. Though
they are entitled to make the application, the application should be filed
within three months from the date of the award of the reference Court
excluding the time taken for obtaining the certified copy of the award as
provided under proviso to Section 28-A. Since the application under section
28-A was filed beyond three months, on the above facts, the same is barred by
limitation. The award of the enhanced compensation to the respondents in this
appeal is clearly illegal and without jurisdiction.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. The order of the reference Court as well as
of the High court stand set aside. No costs.

These appeals are in the nature of cross appeal and relate to further
enhancement of the compensation granted by the High court.
In view of the fact that the Union of India's appeals have been allowed, these
appeals stand dismissed. No costs.
