point of view of a man with average intelligence and imperfect re-collection,
it does not get proved that the trademark of the respondent is deceptively
similar to the trademark of the appellant. In view of the aforesaid,
submissions made by the appellant are of no help to the case of the appellant.
17\. Therefore having said so, I do not find any infirmity in the order passed
by the Learned Additional District judge. In view of the aforesaid, I find no
infirmity in the order passed by the learned FAO No.95/2005 Page 9 of 10
Additional District Judge in having dismissed the application filed by the
appellant under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC. Consequently, the appeal is
dismissed with no orders as to costs. It is however made clear that nothing
stated herein would cause any prejudice or any aspersion on the merits of the
case. The Additional District Judge is however directed to dispose of the suit
itself within one year from the date of the appearance of the parties, who
shall appear before the Additional District Judge on the date already fixed
before the Additional District Judge.
18\. A copy of this order be sent to the trial Court along with record.
C.M.5391/2005(stay) Interim orders stand vacated.
Application is disposed of.
