Andal and Ambal. The words have no direct reference to the character and
quality of snuff. The customers who use the respondent's goods will have a
recollection that they are known by the word Ambal. They may also have a vague
recollection of the portrait of a benign goddess used in connection with the
mark. They -are not likely to remember the fine distinctions between a
Vaishnavite goddess and a Shivaite deity. We think the judgment appealed from
is right and should be affirmed. We are informed that the appellant filed
another application no. 212575 seeking registration of labels of which the
expression "Radha's Sri Andal Madras Snuff" forms a part. The learned
Registrar has disposed of -the application in favour of the appellant. But we
understand that an appeal is pending in the High Court. It was argued that
there was no phonetic similarity between Sri Ambal and Radha's Sri Andal and
the use of the expression Radha's Sri Andal was not likely to lead to
confusion. The Divisional Bench found force in this argument. But as the
matter is sub-judice we express no opinion on it.
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
