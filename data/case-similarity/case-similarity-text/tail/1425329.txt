so as to cover the extended sense. But our duty is to interpret the law as we
find it, and having anxiously considered the question, we are of opinion that
there is no sale as such of materials used in a building contract, and that
the Provincial Legislatures had no competence to impose a tax thereon under
Entry 48, (1) [1946] F.C.R. 67. 84.

To avoid misconception, it must be stated that the above conclusion has
reference to works contracts, which are entire and indivisible, as the
contracts of the respondents have been held by the learned Judges of the Court
below to be. The several forms which such kinds of contracts can assume are
set out in Hudson on Building Contracts, at p.
165\. It is possible that the parties might enter into distinct and separate
contracts, one for the transfer of materials for money consideration, and the
other for payment of remuneration for services and for work done. In such a
case, there are really two agreements, though there is a single instrument
embodying them, and the power of the State to separate the agreement to sell,
from the agreement to do work and render service and to impose a tax thereon
cannot be questioned, and will stand untouched by the present judgment.
In the result, the appeal fails, and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
