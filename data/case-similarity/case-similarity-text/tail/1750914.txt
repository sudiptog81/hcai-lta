If on the facts proved, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are justified
and could not be considered to be based upon `no evidence, there is no
justification for the High Court in exercising writ jurisdiction to interfere
with the same. The promoters of the canteen being permanent employees in the
service of the Bank, permitted to run the canteen, by merely being in control
of the day-to-day affairs of the canteen, the Bank cannot absolve of its
liabilities when it was really using the canteen management as its
instrumentality and agent. The cloak apart, the `voice definitely is that of
Jacobs. Consequently, we could neither find any error of law or other
vitiating circumstances in the judgment of the Division Bench nor any
infirmities in the process of reasoning or gross unreasonableness and
absurdities in the conclusions arrived at to restore the Award, so as to
justify and warrant our interference in the matter.
The claim of the appellants to consider the question of awarding compensation
than to allow them to be reinstated, does not also appeal to us. The canteen
services have to be necessarily provided throughout for the staff and the Bank
can always utilise the services of the workers for the purpose and there is no
justification to deny them of the hard earned benefits of their service.
For all the reasons stated above, we see no merit in the appeals and the
appeals shall stand dismissed. No costs.
