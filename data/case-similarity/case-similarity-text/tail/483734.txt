retrenchment compensation payable to the retrenched workers in accordance with
the provisions of section 25FFF of the Central Act, namely, the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947, without the aid of the proviso to that section. After the
retrenchment compensation is so fixed, a copy of the decision fixing the
compensation payable to each of the workers will be sent by the respondent to
the appellant Union. The workers or their legal representatives, as the case
may be, will then be entitled to receive the retrenchment compensation from
the respondent, which agrees to pay the same to them. The respondent will be
entitled to set off of the amounts of retrenchment compen-
133
(Chandrachud, C.J.) sation already paid to the workers against the amounts
found due to them under this settlement. On receiving the retrenchment
compensation the workers concerned shall withdraw the applications, if any,
filed by them for relief in that behalf.
We would only like to add that the compensation which will be paid to the
workers will be without prejudice to their right, if any, to get employment
from the respondent in the new business as and when occasion arises.
The appeals are accordingly dismissed but there will be no order as to costs.
    N.V.K.					  Appeals dismissed.
