construed, as it must, it would mean that the Food (Health) Authority was the
972 person authorised by the State Government to initiate prosecutions. It was
also permissible for the Food (Health) Authority being the person authorised
under s. 20(1) of the Act to give his written consent for the institution of
such prosecutions by the Food Inspector, Faridkot as laid down by this Court
in State of Bombay v. Parshottam Kanaiyalal, [1961] 1 SCR 458 and The
Corporation of Calcutta v. Md. Omer Ali & Anr., [1976] 4 SCC 527.
In the premises, the impugned notification dated September 7, 1972 issued by
the Food (Health) Authority must be declared as ultra vires the Food (Health)
Authority insofar as the purported to delegate his powers to institute
prosecutions for an offence under the Act under s. 20(1) to the Food
Inspector, Faridkot. It must accordingly follow that the Food Inspector,
Faridkot was not competent to lodge the complaint against the appellants for
having committed an offence punishable under s. 16(1) (a) (ii) read with s. 9
of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
In the result, the appeal must succeed and is allowed. The judgment and order
passed by the High Court and that of the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate,
Moga are set aside.
    P.S.S.					     Appeal allowed.
