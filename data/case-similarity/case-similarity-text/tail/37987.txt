31\. In Master Marine Services (P) Ltd. v. Metcalfe & Hodgkinson (P) Ltd. and
Anr. , the Supreme Court observed:
The modern trend points to judicial restraint in reviewing administrative
actions. Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the
administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure. Even when
defect is found in the decision making process, the court must exercise its
discretionary powers under Article 226 with great caution and should exercise
it only in furtherance of public interest and not merely on the making out of
a legal point. The court should always keep the larger public interest in mind
in order to decide whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when it
comes to a conclusion that overwhelming public interest requires interference,
should the court interfere.
At any event, this is not a fit case for exercise of my discretion under
Article 226 of the Constitution.
32\. In view of all the above, the findings written in the orders dated 4th
September, 2002 and 30th June, 2004 cannot be assailed on any legally tenable
grounds.
The writ petition is wholly devoid of merits and is hereby dismissed.
The respondent no. 2 shall be entitled to costs of the present proceedings
which are quantified at Rs. 10,000/-
