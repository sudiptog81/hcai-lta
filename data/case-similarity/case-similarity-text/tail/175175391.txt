198\. Lastly, a word of caution is necessary that our findings or ratio should
not be construed as an attempt to impart a talismanic precision to this
complex issue which would to a large extent depend on the factual matrix of a
given case. Disputes of such nature, highlight importance of ‗safe harbour
rules', for they instil certainty and curtail litigation.
199\. We must, at the conclusion, commend and acknowledge the contemplative
and epiphanic arguments put forth by the learned counsels of the assessed and
the Revenue. We had the benefit of the meticulous and intensive research and
study by the counsel for the assessed along with their associates, and the
Revenue, who were ably assisted by a team of officers.
200\. The appeals are accordingly disposed of. No costs.
201\. In order to cut short delay, the parties are directed to appear before
the Tribunal on 20th April, 2015, when a date of hearing will be fixed.
