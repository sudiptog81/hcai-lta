contained in Article 14 of the Constitution of India, resort to the theory of
"take it or leave it". The bargaining power of the State and the newspapers in
matters of release of advertisements is unequal. Any unjust condition thrust
upon the petitioners by the State in such matters, in our considered opinion,
would attract the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as also
Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. See Central Inland Water Transport
Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Delhi Transport Corpn. v. D.T.C. Mazdoor
Congress. It is trite that the State in all its activities must not act
arbitrarily. Equity and good conscience should be at the core of all
governmental functions. It is now well settled that every executive action
which operates to the prejudice of any person must have the sanction of law.
The executive cannot interfere with the rights and liabilities of any person
unless the legality thereof is supportable in any court of law. The impugned
action of the State does not fulfil the aforementioned criteria."
We, however, accept the submission that Rule 4(2) of the Rules must be held to
be ultra vires in its entirety as even that part of it, vis-`-vis, the toddy
workers, is not severable. Hence Rule 4(2) is declared ultra vires in its
entirety.
For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. It
is set aside accordingly. The appeals are allowed. No costs.
