observations of the Supreme Court in Durga Dutt Sharma v. N.P. Laboratories
wherein para 29 their Lordships observed as follows:-
"Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the
plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,
packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he
offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade
origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
immaterial: whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape
liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish
his goods from those of the plaintiff."
18\. In the result, I find that this is a case of deceptive similarity and
definite misrepresentation. The consequent damages by way of loss of sale,
goodwill, reputation, etc. are, therefore, bound to follow. The plaintiff,
therefore, have a prima facie case for the grant of an injunction. Having come
to this conclusion, the question of balance of convenience loses significance.
Thus, I consider it appropriate in the interest of justice to allow the Notice
of Motion. Accordingly, the Notice of Motion is allowed in terms of prayer
Clause (c).
19\. Certified copy expedited.
20\. P.S. to give ordinary copy of this judgment to the parties concerned.
