judgment of a court having no territorial jurisdiction, the judgment has to be
set aside. However, the special civil applications cannot be dismissed on this
ground because it has been the contention of the appellants themselves in the
objections filed by them before the High Court, that these applications ought
to be transferred to the High Court at Chennai, in the interest of justice, we
agree with this plea.
For the reasons stated above, these appeals succeed and the same are hereby
allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. We further direct that Special
Civil Application Nos. 3282/99 and 3279/99 filed by the respondents are hereby
directed to be transferred to the High Court of Madras at Chennai forthwith
and on receipt of the papers, we request the Chief Justice of the High Court
of Madras to place them before an appropriate Bench for disposal in accordance
with law. We are also of the opinion that since the parties have already
undergone one round of litigation before the High Court at Ahmedabad and
thereafter in these appeals before us, it is appropriate to request the High
Court to dispose of these appeals as early as possible. The appeals are,
accordingly, allowed.
