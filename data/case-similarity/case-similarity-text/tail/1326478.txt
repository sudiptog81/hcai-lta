petitioner-Company. Moreover, as already noted, the contemptuous stance of
these officials has emanated to a large extent from the illegal instructions
given by the then District Collector. In these circumstances, we would not
like to impose the sentence of imprisonment or fine. We admonish them and warn
them to be careful in future. We further direct that the said two officials
should pay exemplary costs of Rs.1,000/-cach. These amounts shall be remitted
to the credit of the District Legal Services Authority, Guntur, within two
weeks. The said amount shall be paid from out of their own funds.
16\. In the normal course, we would have thought of initiating proceedings
against the District Collector who by his illegal instructions put the
respondents 3 and 4 on a wrong track. But in view of the fact that nearly two
years have elapsed from the date on which the District Collector sent the
offending communication and in view of the period of limitation prescribed in
Section 20, we refrain at this stage to take action against the District
Collector under Contempt of Courts Act.
17\. The contempt case is disposed of accordingly.
18\. The writ petition is allowed with costs quantified at Rs.2,000/- and the
respondents are directed to take steps for the refund of the tax paid by the
petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of this
judgment.
