Nos. 44/56 and 85/56, the Central Board of Revenue or the Commissioner of
Income-tax, as the case may be, instructed the Income-tax Officers concerned
to minimise the inconvenience caused to the assessees and even proceed to
their respective residences or places of business in order to examine the
accounts and evidence. Inspite of the denials of the assessees in the
affidavits which they filed in  273 rejoinder, we presume that such facilities
will continue to be afforded to them in the future and the inconvenience and
harassment which would otherwise be caused to them will be avoided. A humane
and considerate administration of the relevant provisions of the Income-tax
Act would go a long way in allaying the apprehensions of the assessees and if
that is done in the true spirit, no assessee will be in a position to charge
the Revenue with administering the provisions of the Act with " an evil eye
and unequal hand ". We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that there is
no substance in these petitions and they should be dismissed with costs. There
will, be, however, one set of costs between respondents in each of the
petitions and one set of costs in each group of these petitions, viz., (1)
Petitions Nos. 97 & 97-A of 1956, (2) Petitions Nos. 44/56 and 85/56, (3)
Petitions Nos. 86/56, 87/56, 88/56, 111/56, 112/56 and 158/56, (4) Petitions
Nos. 211 to 215 of 1956, and (5) Petitions Nos. 225 to 229 of 1956.
Petitions dismissed.
