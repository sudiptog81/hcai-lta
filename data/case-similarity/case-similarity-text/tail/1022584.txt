parties Would have been well advised to adduce better evidence and therefore
when the first defendant prays for a further opportunity to adduce evidence we
are inclined to view it favourably. It is not that merely for the asking we
are inclined to give an opportunity. That should not be the case. But taking
into account the circumstances and the nature of the evidence in the case, we
are not happy that the matter should be left as it is and in the interests of
justice, we are inclined to grant an opportunity to the first defendant
provided he is agreeable to comply with the heavy terms that we propose to
impose. In case the entire costs of the appellant in this appeal is paid by
the first defendant to the appellant's counsel in this Court within one month
from this date, the decree of the Court below will stand set aside and the
case will stand remitted to the Court below for enabling the parties to adduce
evidence and in that event the Court below will take up the matter immediately
and post the case day-to-day and dispose it of within four months from the
date of receipt of records in that Court. In case the condition is not
complied with, there is no question of further opportunity and on the evidence
the first defendant must lose his case on the merits. Now that we have found
that the suit is maintainable that would mean that the plaintiff would be
entitled to a decree in terms of the plaint. In that event the plaint will
stand decreed with costs throughout.
