expansive and is becoming wider day by day. The traditional limitations have
been vanishing and the sphere of judicial scrutiny is being expanded. State
activity too is becoming fast pervasive. As the State has descended into the
commercial field and giant public sector undertakings have grown up, the stake
of the public exchequer is also large justifying larger social audit, judicial
control and review by opening of the public gaze; these necessitate recording
of reasons for executive actions including cases of rejection of highest
offers. That very often involves long stakes and availability of reasons for
action on the record assures credibility to the action; disciplines public
conduct and improves the culture of accountability. Looking for reasons in
support of such action provides an opportunity for an objective review in
appropriate cases both by the administrative superior and by the judicial
process. The submission of Mr. Dwivedi, therefore, commends itself to our
acceptance, namely, that when highest offers of the type in question are
rejected reasons sufficient to indicate the stand of the appropriate authority
should be made available and ordinarily the same should be communicated to the
concerned parties unless there be any specific justification not to do so.
11\. We do not intend to go into matters any further in as much as we do not
propose to apply this test to the present appeals. These appeals fail but we
make no order as to costs.
