to sound a word of caution against intervening at the interlocutory stage in
matters of economic reforms and fiscal statutes.
A number of petitions had been filed in this Court seeking transfer of writ
petitions pending in different High Courts. By order dated 17.2.2000, those
Transfer Petitions were dismissed as not pressed. Besides the writ petitions,
in respect of which, those transfer petitions had been filed, a number of
other petitions are pending disposal in various High Courts. In quite a few of
them the High Courts have granted an interim injunction staying the operation
of the implementation of the amended Section 45-S of the Act. For the view we
have taken now, it is imperative that these petitions, pending in the
different High Courts, are formally disposed off at an early date. We,
therefore, request all the High Courts, in which the petitions are pending
challenging the provisions of Section 45-S, to dispose them of within a period
of three months. Needless to say inasmuch as the validity of Section 45-S has
been upheld by us, the said provision shall be liable to be enforced
notwithstanding any interim orders to the contrary which may have been passed
by any High Court, which interim order must necessarily now loose all its
significance.
For the aforesaid reasons, this writ petition is dismissed. The respondents
will be entitled to costs.
