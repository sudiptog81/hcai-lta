In the face of overwhelming evidence, the entry in the respondent's record
indicating that letter NO. 2776 was issued cannot be accepted. Significantly,
the copy of the disputed letter bears and endorsement of "Receipt and Rubber
Stamp" allegedly of the appellant but the copy of the admitted letter No. 2775
does not bear any endorsement of receipt which the respondent had acted.
43\. In view of the above, and if the letter No. 2776 (forged by the
respondent) is excluded from the evidence, there remains only the letter No.
2775 of 26.8.1991 in which is was not indicated by the respondent to the
appellant to write to the French Bank to deliver the documents only on co-
acceptance by it. The appellant, in the circumstances, was justified in not
mentioning co-acceptance by the French Bank. The case of the respondent being
false and based on fabricated evidence has to be dismissed.
The appeals are consequently allowed, and both the judgments of the
Commission, namely judgments dated 16.11.1993 and 13.12.1994 are set aside and
the Original Complaint of the respondent is dismissed with costs quantified at
Rs. 25,000/-.
