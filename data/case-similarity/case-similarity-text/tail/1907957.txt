circumstance which should be taken as a mitigating factor for quantification
of the damage. In the impugned order the National Commission taking note of
the stipulations in the delivery receipt which was signed by both the parties,
confined the amount of damages to the value of the consignment destroyed/ not
delivered. This contention in our view needs no in-depth consideration for the
reason that there is no material placed before us to show that at the time of
booking of the consignment any representation as stated by Shri Desai was
given by the respondent to the appellant. Shri Shanti Bhushan pointed out that
the question regarding insuring the consignment was raised after the incident
of non-delivery or loss of the consignment took place when the respondent
asked the appellant to issue a certificate of non-delivery of the
consignments. Then the respondent ascertained though it had insured all its
consignments in bulk the amount stated in the policy had been exceeded by the
date the consignments in question were booked, and therefore the insurance
policy was not of any avail so far as non-delivery/loss of the consignments in
question is concerned. It follows that this contention raised by Shri Desai is
also to be rejected. On the discussion in the foregoing paragraphs all the
contentions raised on behalf of the appellant having been negatived the appeal
is dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs. .J (S.SAGHIR
