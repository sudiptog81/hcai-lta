plaintiff's copyright. The only difference is that instead of numeral 1001,
the defendant has used the numeral 9001. In all other respects, the container
of the defendant is a substantial reproduction of the plaintiff's copyright
and thus under Section 55 of the Act, the plaintiff is entitled prima facie to
the relief of permanent injunction for the infringement of his copyright.
(16) The infringement of copyright being prinia facie established. the
plaintiff is entitled to interim relief for the infringement of the copyright
as well.
(17) The principle which applies to the present case for the grant of interim
relief is the same as laid down by Deshpande, J. in Wearwell Cycle Co. (India)
Limited v. Wearwell Industries, Ludhiana and others : (1969) D.L.T. 469(5). No
question of even balance of convenience arises. The defendant has used the
plaintiff's trade-mark only for three months and the balance of convenience is
in favor of the plaintiff that the defendant should be injuncted by temporary
injunction till the disposal of the suit from dealing in white zinc paint
under the containers bearing numeral '9001' having the colour combination of
violet, grey and white as those of the applicant's containers bearing numeral
1001' and from 'passing off' the goods as those of the applicants in any
manner. It is ordered accordingly. Costs of the application will be costs in
the suit.
