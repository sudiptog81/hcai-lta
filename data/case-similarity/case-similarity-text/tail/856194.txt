Reduction of punishment in a case like this is bound to have demoralizing
effect on the women employees and is a retrograde step. There was no
justification for the High Court to interfere with the punishment imposed by
the departmental authorities. The act of the respondent was unbecoming of good
conduct and behaviour expected from a superior officer and undoubtedly
amounted to sexual harassment of Miss X and the punishment imposed by the
appellant, was, thus, commensurate with the gravity of his objectionable
behaviour and did not warrant any interference by the High Court in exercise
of its power of judicial review. At the conclusion of the hearing, learned
counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent was repentant of his
actions and that he tenders an unqualified apology and that he was willing to
also go and to apologize to Miss X. We are afraid, it is too late in the day
to show any sympathy to the respondent in such a case. Any lenient action in
such a case is bound to have demoralizing effect on working women. Sympathy in
such cases is uncalled for and mercy is misplaced. Thus, for what we have said
above the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the punishment as
imposed by the Disciplinary Authority and upheld by the Departmental Appellate
Authority of removal of the respondent from service is upheld and restored.
The, appeals, thus succeed and are allowed. We, however, make no order as to
costs.
