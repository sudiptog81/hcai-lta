1 FAC 4 : 1983 Cri LJ 1801 has held that the aforesaid provisions are
directory and not mandatory. The decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court
in Om Parkash v. State of Punjab (1984) 2 FAC 136 is, however, diametrically
opposite. In that case, the High Court permitted the accused to take benefit
of the violation of the provisions in question and acquitted him. There are a
number of other High Courts as well who have held likewise. The impugned
judgment is, in fact, based on the law laid down in State of Maharashtra v.
Chandanmal Bhanindwal (1979) 1 FAC 235 (Bom). However, the decisions in Om
Parkash's case (supra) as well as in Chandanmal's case (supra), with all
respect, are not good law.
18\. In the above view of the matter, it is clear that the learned Sub-
Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dalhousie has fallen into an error in
discharging the respondent merely on the ground that the time limit prescribed
in R. 7(3) had not been strictly adhered to. As a result, this revision
petition is accepted, the impugned order is set aside and the case remanded to
the trial Court with the direction to proceed with the trial of the case in
accordance with law from the stage it was left.
19\. The parties are directed to appear in the Court of the Sub-Divisional
Judicial Magistrate, Dalhousie on Feb. 22, 1985 after the winter vacation. The
learned Court below is directed to complete the trial at an early date.
