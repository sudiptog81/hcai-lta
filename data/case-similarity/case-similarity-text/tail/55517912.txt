related with the disclosure of the names and addresses of the interviewers.
Bias is not a ground which can be considered for or against a party making an
application to which exemption under Section 8 is pleaded as a defence. We are
unable to accept this reasoning of the High Court. Suffice it to note that the
reasoning of the High Court is not in conformity with the principles stated by
this Court in the CBSE case (supra). The transparency that is expected to be
maintained in such process would not take within its ambit the disclosure of
the information called for under query No.1 of the application. Transparency
in such cases is relatable to the process where selection is based on
collective wisdom and collective marking. Marks are required to be disclosed
but disclosure of individual names would hardly hold relevancy either to the
concept of transparency or for proper exercise of the right to information
within the limitation of the Act.
31\. For the reasons afore-stated, we accept the present appeal, set aside the
judgment of the High Court and hold that the Commission is not bound to
disclose the information asked for by the applicant under Query No.1 of the
application.
