by the trial Court at this stage without expressing any opinion on the
question whether the user of the word 'RUPA-DON' as suggested by the
defendants at this stage in future would amount to infringement or not, except
to that in the circumstances of this pending litigation, if such permission is
granted, the apprehension of the plaintiff that it is likely to cause
confusion and give wrong signals is justified.
84\. However, the prayer for expeditions trial of the suit appears to be
reasonable.
85\. In view of the statement made about the confining the precincts of
evidence to be led before the trial Court, the suit itself shall be put on the
Board of hearing of the trial Court in the month of July 1998. The evidence,
documentary or oral, whatever, shall be produced by the plaintiff, as far as
possible, by 30th October, 1998 and the evidence by the defendants in
rebuttal, if any, shall be produced within two months thereafter by 31st
December, 1998. The trial should be completed by the Court as far as possible
by 3 1st January, 1999.
86\. As a result, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed with costs
subject to the aforesaid directions.
87\. Appeal dismissed.
