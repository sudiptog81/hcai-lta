to abdicate the terms of the contract or what the parties desired under the
contract and not beyond the same. As a matter of fact in Associated
Engineering (supra) the Umpire has, as regards the claim, directed payment of
a sum of Rs, 4.25 (Rupees four and paise twenty-five) per sq. metre of napa
slab lining towards escalation in the cost of napa slabs and there was, in
fact, no provision in the contract allowing escalation for napa slabs and it
is on this score, this Court came down heavily upon the authority of the
arbitrator to direct payment of escalation charges when the agreement does not
provide for the same. The decision thus in Associated Engineering (supra) also
is of no assistance to the respondents herein.
Presently in the contextual facts, there is no evidence on record that the
umpire has overstepped his jurisdiction or has travelled beyond the agreement
and it is in this perspective that the court ought not to have entertained the
objection and set aside the award as passed by the chosen forum of the
parties. The High Court thus was in manifest error in entertaining the appeal
and setting aside the awards. The order as passed by the High Court cannot be
sustained and the law being well settled on the score should not have been
misread and misapplied by the High Court.
The appeal is allowed. The order of the 1st Sub-Divisional Judge. Bokaro
stands restored. There shall however be no order as to costs.
