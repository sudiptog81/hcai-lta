assuming that the company had established a prima facie case, about which we
do not express any opinion, we do not think that it was sufficient
justification for granting the interim orders as was done by High Court. There
was no question of any balance of convenience being in favour of the
respondent-Company. The balance of convenience was certainly in favour of the
Government of India. Governments are not run on mere Bank Guarantees. We
notice that very often some courts act as if furnishing a Bank Guarantee would
meet the ends of justice. No governmental business or for that matter no
business of any kind can be run on mere Bank Guarantees. Liquid cash is
necessary for the running of a Government as indeed any other enterprise. We
consider that where matters of public revenue are concerned, it is of utmost
importance to reales that interim orders ought not to be granted merely
because a prima facie case has been shown. More is required. The balance of
convenience must be clearly in favour of the making of an interim order and
there should not be the slightest indication of a likelihood of prejudice to
the public interest. We are very sorry to remark that these considerations
have not been borne in mind by the High Court and interim order of this
magnitude had been granted for the mere asking. The appeal is allowed with
costs. E N.V.K. Appeal allowed.
