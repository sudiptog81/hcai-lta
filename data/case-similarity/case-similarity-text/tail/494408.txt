The point came up again for consideration before this Court in The State of
Mysore v. Mysore Spinning & Manufacturing Co. (2) and it was held following
the decision cited above that Art.286((1)(b) could be invoked only in respect
of the sale which occasions the export, and not of any sales precedent to it.
On these authorities the law must be taken to be well settled that it is only
the sale under which the export is made that is protected by Art.. 286 (1)(b),
and that a purchase which precedes such a (1) A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 158. (2) A.I.R.

sale does not fall within its purview though it is made for the purpose of, or
with a view to export. The impugned legislation must accordingly be held not
to contravene Art. 286(1)(b).
In the result both the contentions urged by the appellants fail and the
appeals must be dismissed with costs, one hearing fee.
Appeals dismissed.
