discretion and pass orders based solely on their personal predilections and
peculiar dispositions. Judicial discretion wherever it is requires to be
exercised has to be in accordance with law and set legal principles."
31\. Where the lower court acts arbitrarily, capriciously or perversely in the
exercise of its discretion, the appellate court will interfere. Exercise of
discretion by granting a temporary injunction when there is 'no material', or
refusing to grant a temporary injunction by ignoring the relevant documents
produced, are instances of action which are termed as arbitrary, capricious or
perverse. When we refer to acting on 'no material' (similar to 'no evidence'),
we refer not only to cases where there are total dearth of material, but also
to cases where there is no relevant material or where the material, taken as a
whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the exercise of discretion. In
this case, there was 'no material' to make out a prima facie case and
therefore, the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, was justified in
interfering in the matter and vacating the temporary injunction granted by the
trial court.
32\. We find no reason to interfere with the order of the High Court in the
seven appeals. We accordingly dismiss these SLPs. as having no merit. The
petitioners are granted 15 days time to make alternative arrangements. Parties
to bear their respective costs.
