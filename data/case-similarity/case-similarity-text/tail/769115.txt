former is sold as pills in aluminium foils, the latter is sold in prefilled
syringe. Price difference is huge. Over 52 times.
39\. A word on balance of convenience. Defendant has sales of nearby Rs. 8
crores in less than a year. The product is in the market since October, 2005.
Ex-facie, defendants have built a good market. Balance of convenience lies in
favor of the defendants.
40\. Issues of the Business Transfer Agreement not subjected to payment of
stamp duty and effect of subsequent assignment deed are not being dealt with
by me as I am of the opinion that at this stage it is not necessary to
consider the said issues. Similarly, I have not considered effect of
impleadment sought by Unichem Laboratories Ltd. Needless to state, issue of
interim relief has to be predicated on prima facie findings.
41\. The two applications are disposed of vacating the ex-parte injunction
granted on 6.9.2006. But on terms. Defendant shall file yearly statement of
sale of LOPARIN.
42\. The usual mantra. Nothing contained in this order shall be construed as
an expression on the merits of the case. Observations made in the order are
only prima facie findings to decide the fate of the interlocutory application.
Final adjudication would be as per evidence led.
42\. No costs.
