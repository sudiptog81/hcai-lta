signed in all the relevant papers as Nalini and made the insurance company
believe that her name was Nalini, but the said , deceit did not either secure
to her advantage or cause any non-economic loss or injury to the insurance
company. The charge does not disclose any such advantage or injury, nor is
there any evidence to prove the same. The fact that Dr. Vimla said that the
owner of the car who sold it to her suggested that the taking of the sale of
the car in the name of Nalini would be useful for income-tax purposes is not
of any relevance in the present case, for one reason, the said owner did not
say so in his evidence and for the other, it was not indicated in the charge
or in the evidence. In the charge framed, she was alleged to have defrauded
the insurance company and the only evidence given was that if it was disclosed
that Nalini was a minor, the insurance company might not have paid the money.
But as we have pointed out earlier, the entire transaction was that of Dr.
Vimla and it was only put through in the name of her made minor daughter for
reasons best known to herself. On the evidence as disclosed, neither was she
benefited nor the insurance company incurred loss in any sense of the term. In
the result, we allow the appeal and hold that the appellant was not guilty of
the offence under 600 ss. 467 and 468 of the Indian Penal Code. The conviction
and sentence passed on her are set aside. Fine, if paid, is directed to be
refunded to the appellant, Appeal allowed.
