p.a. from the date of deposit till the actual payment is made, which would be
payable to the auction purchaser, which in our opinion is just and reasonable.
The principle that such direction can be issued by this Court in exercise of
its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India would appear
from a decision of this Court in Kishori Lal v. Sales Officer, District Land
Development Bank and Ors. [2006 (8) SCALE 521], wherein it was directed :
"However, with a view to do complete justice between the parties, in our
considered opinion, the appellant should be directed to deposit the entire
auction money with interest thereupon @6% per annum. This order is being
passed by us under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Such amount
should be deposited within eight weeks from this date before respondent No.1,
Sales Officer. On such deposit being made, the auction shall stand set aside
and the possession of the property shall be restored to the appellant herein.
However, in the event the appellant fails and/or neglects to deposit the said
amount within the aforementioned period, these appeals shall stand dismissed."
Following the said decision, herein also we would direct that in the event of
compliance of the aforementioned directions, the auction shall stand set aside
and the decree for partition shall stand satisfied. The appeal is allowed
subject to the aforementioned observations and directions. However, in the
facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
