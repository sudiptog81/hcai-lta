offence. Besides the fact of agreement the necessary mens rea of the crime is
also required to be established.
We have perused the judgments of both the Courts below and considered the
entire case on the touch-stone of well recognised principles for judging a
case of criminal conspiracy. The prosecution has been able to unfold the case
relating to the criminal conspiracy to eliminate Hamza (deceased) by placing
on record the chain of circumstances. We find that both the trial Court and
the High Court discussed the relevant evidence on record taking care to
exclude the portions not acceptable and /or tenable in law. The courts below
have also been fair in discussing the contentions raised on behalf of the
defence in some detail and have given cogent reasons for rejecting the same.
We do not find that the judgments of the Courts below suffer from any
illegality in the approach to the case or any perversity in appreciation of
the evidence on record. We have no hesitation to hold that the judgment of the
High Court confirming the judgment/order of the trial Court convicting and
sentencing the appellants, does not call for any interference. Accordingly the
appeals are dismissed.
