11\. As pointed out in the earlier part of this order the decision to cancel
the tender process was in no way discriminatory or mala fide. On the contrary,
if a contract had been awarded despite the deficiencies in the tender process
serious questions touching the legality and propriety affecting the validity
of the tender process would have arisen. In as much as the competent authority
decided to cancel the tender process, it did not violate any fundamental right
of the appellant nor could the action of the respondent be termed unreasonable
so as to warrant any interference from this Court. The Division Bench of the
High Court was, in that view, perfectly justified in setting aside the order
passed by the Single Judge and dismissing the writ petition.
12\. In the result this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed with costs
assessed at Rs.25,000/-
