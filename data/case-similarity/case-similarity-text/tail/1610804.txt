period of limitation could be extended, the corresponding provisions in the
Limitation Act prescribing the period of limitation for filing an application
for setting aside an award [Article 119(b) of the Schedule to Limitation Act]
and for extending the period of limitation for sufficient cause (section 5 of
the Limitation Act), were inapplicable. It did not relate to applicability of
section 14(2) of Limitation Act. Nor did this Court consider the applicability
of section 14(2). Therefore, the decision in Popular Construction will not
apply. Fairgrowth merely reiterates the principle in Popular Construction in
regard to the exclusion of section 5 of Limitation Act, as is evident from the
following observations :
" the general rule as far as special and local Acts are concerned is that the
specified provisions including Section 5 of the Limitation Act will apply
provided the special or local Act provides a period of limitation different
from that prescribed under the Limitation Act. There is an additional
requirement viz. that the special local Act does not expressly exclude the
application of the Limitation Act."
Therefore it has to be held that section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 is
applicable to proceedings under section 34(1) of the AC Act.
16\. I agree that the appeal arising from SLP (C) No.10311/2005 is to be
dismissed and appeal arising from SLP (C) No.15619/2005 is to be allowed.
