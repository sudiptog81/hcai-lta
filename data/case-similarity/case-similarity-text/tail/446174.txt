No.85.24 which is for levying duty on records, tapes and other recorded media
for sound or other similarly recorded phenomena. As mentioned in the
Notification dated 16th March, 1995, computer software is covered by Heading
No.85.24. The said notification also covers computer software imported in the
form of printed books, pictures, manuscripts and typed scripts covered by
Chapter 49. Computer software can be brought either on a floppy or magnetic
tape or on a hard disk or in a printed form and hence, what is imported is
software on a container which is a hard disk drive. The value of the
containers (hard disks) approximately in the present case is Rs.60000/- or
Rs.65000/-. As against this, the cost of the computer software is roughly
Rs.67 lakhs. Therefore, it can be said that what is imported by the appellant
is essentially a computer software.
In this view of the matter, the order dated 25th March, 1996 of the
Commissioner of Customs and the order dated 14th May, 1999 of the Tribunal
confirming the said order in Appeal No.161/96-B2 are quashed and set aside. It
is held that computer software imported by the appellant on a hard disk drive
is assessable at the rate of 10% as per Heading 85.24 with the Exemption
Notification stated above because what was imported by the appellant was
software on a hard disk and it was not hard disk in the garb of software.
In the result, the appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.
