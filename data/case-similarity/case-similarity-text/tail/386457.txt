provisions of the Act. So too, in regard to the payment made by the assessees
towards such debts they could claim relief by way of deductions only if such
deductions were permissible under the Act.
The High Court held that the assessees who had received repayments would not
be liable to tax in respect of amounts they had received towards principal but
they would be so liable in respect of moneys which they had received towards
interest. It further held that those assessees who had made payments towards
the 826 debts would be entitled to deduct from their income and claim
exemption from tax only such amounts as they had paid on account of interest
but they would not be entitled to deduct any payment made on account of
principal. The High Court also gave a direction that in the case of open
payments the respective amounts paid towards principal or interest should be
ascertained in accordance with the law of appropriation of payments. Neither
the learned Solicitor- General, who appeared for the Revenue, nor the learned
counsel, who appeared for the assessees, questioned the correctness of the
said directions if the construction we placed on the Ordinance was correct.
The directions given by the High Court will, therefore, stand. In our view,
the High Court gave correct answers to the questions referred to it.
In the result the appeals are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.
Appeals dismissed 827
