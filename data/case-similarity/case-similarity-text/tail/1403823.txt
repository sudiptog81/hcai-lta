respondent rested his claim to recover possession, and that was as follows.
While the respondent himself was in phvsical Possession of the property he had
to leave Calcutta on medical advice in or about December 8, 1948 and at that
date he put the defendant Gupta into possession on the understanding that on
the respondent's return to Calcutta the defendant would hand over to the
plaintiff possession of the premises and the management of the business. The
respondent further stated that he returned to Calcutta in or about December,
1949 and occupied one of the rooms of the suit property and made demands on
the defendant to hand over possession and management which he failed to do.
This case of the respondent has been concurrently found to be true by both the
Courts. It would be seen that the basis of the respondent's claim to
possession is independent of and wholly dissociated from the illegal
transaction of the original benami purchase and falls into line with Sajan
Singh's case(1). Not being tainted with illegality, the respondent's claim on
this footing is not open to objection and as it has been upheld by both the
Courts I agree that the appeal should stand dismissed and also to the order
for costs proposed by my learned brother.
Appeal dismissed.
