We are not concerned with the particular incumbents of the office. So long as
the office was validly created, it matters not that the incumbent was not
validly appointed. A person appointed as a Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions
Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge, would be exercising jurisdiction in the
Court of Session, and his judgments and orders would be those of the Court of
Session. They would continue to be valid as the judgments and orders, of the
Court of Session, notwithstanding that his appointment to such Court might be
declared invalid. On that account alone, it can never be said that the
procedure prescribed by law has not been followed. It would be a different
matter if the constitution of the Court itself is under challenge. We are not
concerned with such situation in the instant cases. We, therefore, find no
force in any of the submissions of the learned counsel.
Shri Govindan Nair attempted to argue that the confiscation was not justified
on the merits. We find no reason to interfere with 488 the concurrent findings
of fact arrived at by the lower Courts. Shri Phadke requested us to widen the
scope of the appeals and to permit him to canvas the correctness of the
convictions and sentences also. We declined to do so. All the appeals are
dismissed.
P.B.R Appeals dismissed.
