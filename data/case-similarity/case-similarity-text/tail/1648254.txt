Judges of this Court and the present impugned order passed by another learned
Single Judge have held that since the offending goods are being sold by the
appellant / defendant at a particular place, it shall definitely give
jurisdiction to the court of such a place, which is also what was held in M/s
Jawahar Engineering Company (supra). It is necessary to mention at this stage
that in view of the decision rendered in Dhodha House (supra), the Supreme
Court held that the decision in M/s Jawahar Engineering Company (supra) will
not be applicable to the facts of the case before it. Since the application
for registration of trademark in the cases before it had not been made within
the territory of Delhi, the Supreme Court in the case of Dhodha House (supra)
found and held that the decision in the case of Jawahar Engineering Company
(supra) would be inapplicable to the facts of the said case before it. In the
said case, the Division Bench of this Court also held that such court will
have jurisdiction where the trade mark is sought to be sold and if such trade
mark is being sought for sale in Delhi amongst other places, Delhi shall also
have jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.
20\. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered
opinion that the order dated 28th April, 2006, passed by the learned Single
Judge does not suffer from any infirmity. We find no merit in this appeal and
the same is dismissed. No order as to costs.
