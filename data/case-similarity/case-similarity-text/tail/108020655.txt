law so as to attract Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 in these
appeals. We are afraid that we cannot agree. One substantial question of law
is whether, when public interest is involved, waiver can at all take place of
a right in favour of the generator of electricity under a PPA if the right
also has an impact on consumer interest. This substantial question of law has
been answered by us in the course of the judgment. We have also pointed out
that the Appellate Tribunal’s finding that the Independent Engineer’s test
certificate can pass muster and that there is a waiver on facts is not a
possible conclusion, and such finding is, therefore, perverse and hence set
aside. That apart, we have also pointed out the contradictory nature of the
judgment of the Appellate Tribunal, when it points out that the requirement of
Article 6.3.1 is not merely for the private benefit of the procurers of
electricity, but is as a matter of general policy; and then later on in the
judgment finds that no question of public interest or public policy arises in
the present case. In these circumstances, this plea must also be turned down.
In the result, the appeals are allowed but with no order as to costs.
