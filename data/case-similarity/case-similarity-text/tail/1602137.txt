(2003 (8) SCC 311), Ram Chandra Singh's case (supra) and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v.
State of T.N. and Another (2004 (3) SCC 1).
Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the court.
(see Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust (1996 (3) SCC 310) and
S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu's case (supra).
"Fraud" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other person
or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the
conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is not
fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav's case
(supra).
In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning observed at
pages 712 & 713, "No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be
allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."
In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ observed that fraud vitiates all
transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity.
Considering the aforesaid principles of law and the background facts, the
Tribunal was justified in modifying the earlier order and varying it. The
Appellate Tribunal did not commit any error in upholding it. The High court's
order is clearly unsustainable and is set aside.
The appeal is allowed with no orders as to costs.
