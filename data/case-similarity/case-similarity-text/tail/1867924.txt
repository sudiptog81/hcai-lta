On conclusion of the enquiry charge No. 1 was found to have been established
while charge No. 2 was partially proved. In his report to the State Government
the Collector of Kolhapur held that the respondent's action was helpful to
Shri Khatavane to sell the sugar in the black market, and it amounted to a
serious default on his part as a Government servant. He recommended that since
the respondent had already retired from service a lenient view should be taken
and reduction in pension to the extent of Re. 1 per month be made The State
Government accepted the findings and passed the impugned order reducing the
pension by 50 per cent In our view the reduction of pension 50 per cent was
too harsh and disproportionate to the misconduct proved against the
respondent. The State Government should have taken into consideration the fact
that the respondent had retired from service and the reduction of pension by
50 per cent would seriously affect his living.
Accordingly, we allow the appeal partly, and set aside the order of the High
Court dated February 13, 1987, and the State Government's order dated December
4, 1982 and direct the State Government to reconsider the question of
reduction of respondent's pension. There will be no order regarding costs.
    N.P.V.					Appeal allowed.
