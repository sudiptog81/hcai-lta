are noted, it must be held that the direction contained in paragraph 7 of the
PFA of the Arbitral Tribunal was duly carried out by the appellant based on
the first request of the respondent themselves as made on 19.1.2012 and as per
the modified request dated 3.4.2012. If that was the real fact situation in
regard to the execution of the transfer deed, which was completely omitted to
be noted by the learned Single Judge, it must be held that there was no
occasion for the respondent to have any grievance in regard to the execution
of the transfer deed as directed in paragraph 7 of the PFA of the Arbitral
Tribunal dated 23.12.2011. The failure on the part of the learned Judge in
having noted the fact that the transfer deed dated 4.4.2012 was as per the re-
draft forwarded by the respondent themselves which was duly executed and sent
back by the appellant by 9.4.2012 and the original by 12.4.2012 unfortunately
resulted in the passing of the impugned order. In the light of the said patent
illegality in the impugned order, the same is liable to be set aside.
In the said circumstances, the impugned order of the learned Judge cannot be
sustained, the same is set aside and the appeals stand allowed.
