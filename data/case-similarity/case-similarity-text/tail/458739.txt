and, therefore, the very foundation for proceeding for contempt of court is
completely absent in such cases. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that
unless there is an express undertaking given in writing before the court by
the contemner or incorporated by the court in its order, there can be no
question of wilful disobedience of such an undertaking. In the instant case,
we have already held that there is neither any written undertaking filed by
the appellant nor was any such undertaking impliedly or expressly incorporated
in the order impugned. Thus, there being no undertaking at all the question of
breach of such an undertaking does not arise.
For these reasons, therefore, we are of the opinion that however improper or
reprehensible the conduct of the appellant may be yet the act of the appellant
in not complying with the terms of the consent order does not amount to an
offence under section 2(b) of the Act and his conviction and order of
detention in civil prison for four months is wholly unwarranted by law. The
appeal is accordingly allowed. The judgment of the High Court is set aside and
the order passed by the High Court directing the appellant to be detained in
civil prison for four months is hereby quashed and the appellant is acquitted
of the offence under section 2(b) of the Act.
N.V.K. Appeal allowed.
