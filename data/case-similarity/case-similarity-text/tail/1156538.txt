28\. It is, however, amply clear that even if the Court does not grant interim
relief in favour of the plaintiffs, some directions must be issued to ensure
that in the event of his success in the action, his interests are protected.
We, therefore, direct that the respondent shall maintain full and complete
accounts of all the sales made of the Kiltas manufactured by it. The defendant
shall submit the returns in this Registry of this Court every quarter. A copy
of this return shall also be handed over to Mr. Vinay Kuthiala, counsel for
the appellants/plaintiffs. The defendant shall file a consolidated return for
all the Kiltas sold by it from the date of institution of the suit till
30-9-2007 by 31st October, 2007. Thereafter the defendant shall file quarterly
returns depicting the sales of each quarter within 30 days of the ending of
each quarter. The defendant shall also file copies of the complete accounts
with regard to sale of the Kiltas made during the pendency of the suit duly
certified by the Chartered Accountant of the defendant-company in a similar
manner. The respondent/defendant shall furnish a surety bond in the sum of Rs.
20 lacs to the satisfaction of the Registrar (Inspection) of this Court
undertaking to pay the decretal amount, if any, which may be decreed in favour
of the plaintiffs and against the defendant. This order has been passed to
protect the interest of the plaintiffs in case they succeed.
The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. No costs.
