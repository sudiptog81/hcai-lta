but on closer consideration, we have come to the conclusion that it would not
be right or proper for us to do so, once we have formed the opinion that the
impugned rules have not been validly made and are illegal and of no force.
This Court is only concerned to interpret the law, and if it finds that it is
valid, it would proceed to apply the same; but where it finds that the law is
not valid, then it is properly not its business, under such circumstances, to
enter upon a discussion, or, to advise what the law should be. We have,
therefore, come to the conclusion that it would not be right or proper for us
to deal with the particular criticisms raised at certain specific Rules before
us.
30\. The result is that we allow these petitions and strike down the Rules of
1959 as having not been made in accordance with the essential statutory
procedure which was and is a condition precedent to their valid enactment.
With these Rules, the scheme or schemes framed thereunder must also fall. It
is hardly necessary for us to add that nothing that we have said here shall
prevent the Government from making the rules in accordance with essential
statutory requirements and in due course giving effect to a scheme or schemes
for the nationalisation of road transport on the routes involved in these
petitions in accordance with law. The etitioners will have one set of costs
from the respondent State in each case.
