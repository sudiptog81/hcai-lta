prior art.
63\. It is well-settled that a mere registration of the design does not
entitle the registrant of the design to claim protection and it is always open
to the defendant to plead and set up a defence of lack of novelty or eye
appeal and of existence of prior art (see Metro Plastic Industries (Regd.)
(supra)). In my view, reliance placed by Mr. Sethi on the Eicher Goodearth
Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is of no avail, since I am of the view that there is no
appeal to the eye in respect of the plaintiff's design and also in view of the
fact that there is no CS(Comm)192/2016 Page 36 of 37 novelty in the
plaintiff's design as the same existed in prior art. Reliance placed on Bhatia
Enterprises (supra) is of no avail since the defendant has been able to show,
prima facie, the publication of the prior art many years before the
registration of the plaintiff's design.
64\. For all the aforesaid reasons, I find no merit in the present application
and dismiss the same with costs of Rs.50,000/- to the defendant. It is,
however, made clear that the observations made by me in this order are founded
upon only a, prima facie, evaluation of the materials placed before the Court
and shall not prejudice the case of either party at the final stage post-
trial.
