the suit or application the Court should accept that the statements made in
the plaint/application are true, until such averment is questioned the Court
will proceed on the basis of the averments. It appears to us that the said
principle has escaped from the mind of His Lordship. It is also appeared that
His Lordship also failed to consider that the contract was concluded at 24,
Park Street, Kolkata, i.e. within the jurisdiction of this Court. The
arbitration clause has specifically stated that the venue of the arbitration
tribunal would be at Kolkata. Therefore, balance of convenience at this stage
lies in favour of the appellant.  13
In these circumstances we find that the submissions made by Mr. Chatterjee
have substance and we accept the reasoning given by him.
Accordingly, we grant leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent in favour of
the appellant to institute this application. The appellant should be at
liberty to take steps accordingly.
For the reasons stated hereinabove, we set aside the impugned order and allow
this appeal.
Photostat certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied to the
parties.
(PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE, J.) I agree.
