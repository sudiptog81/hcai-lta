10) Normally, the judgment/order should be set aside or affirmed as the case
may be but preferably without offering any undesirable comments, disparaging
remarks or indications which would impinge upon the dignity and respect of
judicial system.
11) Every effort should be made by the print and electronic media to ensure
that the distinction between trial by media and informative media should
always be maintained. Trial by media should be avoided particularly, at a
stage when the suspect is entitled to the constitutional protections. Invasion
of his rights is bound to be held as impermissible.
154) In the light of the above discussion, we hold that the prosecution has
established its case beyond doubt against the appellants and we are in
agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court, consequently, all
the appeals are devoid of any merit and are accordingly dismissed.
