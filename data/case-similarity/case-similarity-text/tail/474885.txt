plaint says that this threat was received within the jurisdiction of the High
Court a fact which was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that Court.
The respondents' reliance on the decision of this Court in Oil and Natural Gas
Commission V. Utpal Kumar Basu and Ors. 1994 (1) Supp SCR 252 and Union of
India and Others V. Advani Exports Ltd. and Another 2002 (1) SCC 567 is
inapposite. Those decisions held that the service of a mere notice may not be
sufficient to found jurisdiction unless such notice formed an integral part of
the cause of action. But a 'cease and desist' notice in a copyright action
cannot, particularly in view of Section 60 of the Act, be termed to be a
'mere' notice. Such a threat may give rise to the right to institute a suit to
counter such threat and to ask for relief on the ground that the alleged
infringement to which the threat related was not in fact an infringement of
any legal right of the person making such threat. As we have seen, the
Division Bench disposed of the appeals solely on the issue of jurisdiction.
Its conclusion on the issue is insupportable. The impugned decision is
accordingly set aside and the matter is remanded back to the Division Bench
for disposal of the appeals filed by the respondents and appellants on merits.
Pending the decision of the Division Bench, the order passed by the learned
Single Judge which we have quoted earlier will continue. The appeals are
accordingly allowed with costs.
