question of law arising in these appeals has been the subject matter of
consideration in Civil Appeal No. 2518 of 1966. For the reasons given in that
judgment we hold that these appeals also should be allowed and the judgments
of the Punjab High Court should be set aside and the writ petitions filed by
the respondents in each case should be dismissed. These appeals are
accordingly allowed with costs. There will be one hearing fee for these
appeals and for Civil Appeal No. 2518 of 1966.
