It appears to us that the conclusion reached by the Courts below that the
appellants mark is deceptively similar to that of the respondents cannot be
stated to be erroneous. Besides, this question of deceptive similarity is a
question of fact, unless the test employed for determining it suffers from
error. In the present case, it was not suggested that the Courts below had
committed any error in laying down the principles on which the comparison has
to be made and deceptive similarity ascertained. (See per Lord Watson in
Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Attorney- General for Ontario
etc.) (2) . As there are concurrent findings of fact on this matter, we do not
propose to enter into a discussion of this question de novo, since we are
satisfied that the conclusion reached is not unreasonable. (1) Kerly on Trade
Marks 8th Edn. 407. (2) [1897] A.C. 199.

Lastly it was submitted that this was a case of honest con- current user
within s. 10(2) of the Act. This point was, however, not raised in any of the
Courts below and we do not propose to entertain it for the first time in this
Court. The result is, the appeals are dismissed with costs-one set of hearing
fee.
Appeals dismissed.
