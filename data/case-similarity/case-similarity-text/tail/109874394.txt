           iv)      "Hits of Salman Khan"
           v)       "Hum Aapke Hai Kaun"
However, I may clarify that it shall be open to the defendant to market it
version recordings under labels and covers, which do not deceive or confuse
the unsuspecting CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 & 399/2005 Page 75 of 76 customer with
regard to the fact that they are version recordings and not recordings from
the original sound track.
(B) I.A. NO.2382/2005 in C.S. (OS) No.329/2005 is allowed and the defendant is
restrained from incorporating its version recordings in cinematograph films,
such as VCDs and DVDs embodying the literary or musical works, the copyright
of which vests in the plaintiff and without the written license from the
plaintiff. (C) The defendant shall also maintain their account books in
relation to the aforesaid titles and each year the same should be placed on
record within one month of the preparation and adoption of the same by the
defendant, on the record of this case. Any observation made by me in the
aforesaid order is tentative and shall not prejudice any right of either party
at the stage of disposal of the Suit.
Applications stands disposed of.
