The same reasoning applies to the case of non-compliance of Rule 7(3) also and
unless there is proof of prejudice, there can be no cause for complaint by the
accused.
In Craies' Statute Law, VIII Edn. at page 262 it is stated thus:
It is the duty of courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the
legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be
construed.... That in each case you must look to the subject-matter, consider
the importance of the provision and the relation of that provision to the
general object intended to be secured by the Act, and upon a review of the
case in that aspect decide whether the enactment is what is called imperative
or only directory.
Likewise in State of Kerala and Ors. v. Allasserry Mohammed and Ors. , Hon
Untwalia, J. speaking for the Supreme Court and while holding that Rule 22 of
Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules is only directory, held that 'If the
object is not frustrated and is squarely and justifiably achieved without any
shadow of doubt, then it will endanger public health to acquit offenders on
technical grounds which have no substance.
19\. Therefore we are of the view that Rule 7(3) is only directory and not
mandatory. No interference is called for in this appeal. It is accordingly
dismissed.
