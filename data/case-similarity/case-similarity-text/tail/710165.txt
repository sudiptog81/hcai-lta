learned Chief Presidency Magistrate has gone into the question very carefully
and there are good grounds for his conclusion that the offending pictures have
been produced by taking copies of Ex. 1, 4 and 7 by having them retouched,
i.e, painted over in different colours and using these retouched pictures a3
originals for making negatives, blocks and pictures by the ordinary three
colour process. No doubt the sentiment expressed in the copyright pictures is
common in Vaishnav literature, but the question is whether the offending
pictures are copies of substantial portions of the copyright pictures. In my
view there can be only one answer to this question and it is in the
affirmative. The figures may have been reduced in the offending pictures and
slight modifications may have been introduced, or the clothes and colours may
have been different, but there can be no doubt whatsoever that the main
[figures have an identical pose. These are not, in my opinion, coincidences
due to the pictures being produced to represent common stock ideas. If once
that conclusion is reached, it is difficult to see on what grounds the orders
made by the Magistrate can be challenged. In my opinion, the petitioners have
failed to show any grounds for interfering with the orders complained of and I
would accordingly discharge these rules.
