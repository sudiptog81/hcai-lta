This presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far and cannot be carried
to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and
unknown reason for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile
and discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc. v. W. H. Ellis, (1897)
165 U.S. 150; 41 L. Ed. 666). There may be cases where improper execution of
power will result in injustice to the parties. As has been observed, however,
the possibility of such discriminatory treatment cannot necessarily invalidate
the legislation and where there is an abuse of such power, the parties
aggrieved are not without ample remedies under the law (Vide Dinabandhu. Sahu
v. Jadumony Mangaraj, [1955] 1 S. C. R. 140,146). What will be struck down in
such cases will not be the provision which invests the authorities with such
power but the abuse of the power itself."
It, therefore, follows that s. 7 of the Act cannot be impugned on the ground
of excessive delegation of legislative power.
All the various contentions urged by the petitioners therefore fail and the
result is that the petitions filed by the petitioners before us must be
dismissed with costs. The State of Bombay which is the only respondent in all
these petitions will however get only one set of costs therein.
Petitions dismissed.
