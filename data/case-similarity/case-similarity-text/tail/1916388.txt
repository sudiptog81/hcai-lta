49.For the reasons discussed above, this Court is of the opinion a writ
petition is not ordinarily maintainable to challenge an order of the Tribunal.
We, therefore, dismiss the appeal, of course for reasons which are different
from the ones given by the High Court in dismissing the writ petition.
50.In view of this Court's jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution,
we give liberty to the appellant, if so advised, to file an appeal before an
appropriate High Court within the meaning of Explanation to Section 35 of FEMA
and if such an appeal is filed within a period of thirty days from today, the
appellate forum will consider the question of limitation sympathetically
having regard to the provision of Section 14 of the Limitation Act and also
having regard to the fact that the appellant was bona-fide pursuing his case
under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Delhi High Court and then its
appeal before this Court.

51.With the aforesaid direction, the appeal is dismissed. The parties are left
to bear their own costs.
