between partners to arbitrator as provided in the condition of their
agreement, cannot be accepted as sound. The ,reason given by the Divisional
Bench that as s. 69 allows dissolution and accounts of unregistered
partnership it cannot bar such an application appears to us to be not quite in
Point.
In our judgment, the words 'other proceeding' in sub- s. (3) must receive
their full meaning untramelled by the words 'a claim of set-off'. The latter
words neither intend nor can be construed to cut down the generality of the
words 'other proceeding'. The sub-section provides for the application of the
provisions of sub-ss. (1) and (2) to claims of set-off and also to other
proceedings of any Kind which can properly be said to be for enforcement of
any right arising from contract except those expressly mentioned as exceptions
in sub-s. (3) and sub-s. (4). The appeal is, therefore, allowed. The decision
of the High Court will be set aside and the application under s. 8(2) of the
Arbitration Act shall stand dismissed with costs throughout on the applicant
in the High Court. Appeal allowed
