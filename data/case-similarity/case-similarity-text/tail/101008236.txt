already held above that disclosure of marks, which though exists with the
appellant would amount to allowing play to the policy earlier prevalent of
marking the examinees. Merely because the appellant/its examiners for the
purpose of grading, first mark the students would not compel this court to put
at naught or to allow full play to the new policy of grades.
17\. No weightage can also be given to the submission of the respondent LPA
No.1090/2011 Page 10 of 11 that the marks even if disclosed would not be used
for any other purpose. Such an offer cannot be enforced by the Court and the
Court cannot on the basis thereof allow disclosure of something which was not
intended to exist in the first place. The possibility of the respondent and
his ward, in securing admission and for other purposes using the said
information to secure an advantage over others cannot be ruled out.
18\. We are therefore unable to agree with the reasoning of the CIC and of the
learned Single Judge and allow this appeal. We hold the information,
disclosure of which was sought, to be no information and also exempt from
disclosure. We allow this appeal as well as the writ petition preferred by the
respondent and set aside the order dated 27.09.2011 of the CIC.
No order as to costs.
