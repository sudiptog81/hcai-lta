make such appointments and it is impermissible to recognize such appointments
made in the teeth of directions issued by the Government in that regard. We
have also held that they are not legally entitled to any such relief. Granting
of the relief claimed would mean paying a premium for defiance and
insubordination by those concerned who engaged these persons against the
interdict in that behalf. Thus, on the whole, the appellants in these appeals
are found to be not entitled to any relief. These appeals have, therefore, to
be dismissed.
48\. C.A. Nos. 3520-24 of 2002 have also to be allowed since the decision of
the Zilla Parishads to make permanent the employees cannot be accepted as
legal. Nor can the employees be directed to be treated as employees of the
Government, in the circumstances. The direction of the High Court is found
unsustainable.
49\. In the result, Civil Appeal Nos. 3595-3612 of 1999, Civil Appeal No. 3849
of 2001, Civil Appeal Nos. 3520-3524 of 2002 and Civil appeal arising out of
Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 9103-9105 of 2001 are allowed subject to
the direction issued under Article 142 of the Constitution in paragraph 46 and
the general directions contained in paragraph 44 of the judgment and Civil
Appeal Nos. 1861-2063 of 2001 are dismissed. There will be no order as to
costs.
