is a plenary power. It is true that the Commissioner is not subordinate to the
District Court but the District Court has powers to correct, modify, review or
set aside the order passed by the Commissioner. All the characteristics of an
appeal and all the powers of an appel- late Court are available to the
District Court while decid- ing an application under Section 72. To decide
this case we must be guided not only by the nomenclature used by the Section
for the proceedings but by the essence and content of the proceedings. That
being so, we have no hesitation to hold that the proceedings before the
District Court under Section 72(1) are in the nature of an appeal and that
Dis- trict Court exercises appellate jurisdiction while disposing of a matter
under Section 72(1). Consequently, the Single Judge of the High Court while
deciding the appeal from the order of the District Court deals with a matter
made by the District Judge in the exercise of an appellate jurisdiction by a
Court subject to the superintendence of the High Court and hence clause 15 of
the Letters Patent is directly at- tracted.
The appeal has, therefore, to fail and is dismissed. However, there will be no
order as to costs.
