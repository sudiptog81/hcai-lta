months of sales made by the Appellant under this new trade name which amounts
to a figure of Rs. 2.71 Crores from 17.12.2017 till 18.08.2018.
12) We may also state, that this trade name was registered in the name of the
Appellant way back on 14.11.2009 with  14 effect from a date in 2008, but had
not been utilized till the Division Bench judgment was passed against the
Appellant. We are also told that the remaining stock of material has been
disposed of under the trade name “CHYMTRAL”, and that material manufactured
after the Division Bench judgment is not being sold under the said trade name
despite the stay granted in favour of the Appellant. Seeing the sales figures
of ‘Chymowok’ from December, 2017 till August, 2018 and the fact that the
Appellant’s sales under the “new” trade name are substantial, we do not think
that we should exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of
the Constitution of India in favour of the Appellant, seeing that the balance
of convenience is well served by the judgment under appeal. The Appeal is,
therefore, rejected.
