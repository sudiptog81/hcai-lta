and the effective control is transferred to the customer. The transaction will
therefore be a deemed sale, exigible to tax under Section 5C.
(ii) On the other hand, if the customer engages the petitioner for providing
audio visual services for any programme or event and the petitioner does not
deliver any equipment to the customer, but takes the equipment to the site of
the programme, installs them, operates them and then dismantles them and
brings them back after the period of hiring, in such an event the possession
and effective control never leaves the petitioner and the customer never gets
the right to the use of equipment. In such an event there is no deemed sale
attracting tax under Section 5C.
The undisputed facts in this case disclose that the transaction of the
petitioners falls under the second category and therefore, the transactions
are not transfer of use of goods amounting to deemed sales exigible to tax
under Section 5-C of the Act.
11\. The petitions are, therefore, allowed and the impugned notices dated
November 25, 1999 and June 5, 2000 (annexure A) in both the writ petitions are
quashed. It is made clear that if the petitioner carries on any transaction of
the nature falling under para 10(i) above, the assessing authority will be at
liberty to lake action to bring such transactions to tax under Section 5-C, in
accordance with law.
