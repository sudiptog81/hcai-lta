power is exercised the nature of sanctions involved therein. Blacklisting has
the effect of preventing a person from the privilege and advantage of entering
into lawful relationship with the Government for purposes of gains. The fact
that a disability is created by the order of blacklisting indicates that the
relevant authority is to have an objective satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair
play require that the person concerned should be given an opportunity to
represent.his case before he is put on the blacklist. With regard to the case
of the petitioners, it is made clear that the authorities will give an
opportunity to the petitioners to represent their case, and the authorities
will hear the petitioners as to whether their name should be put on the
blacklist or not. This is made clear that the decision on this question will
not have any effect on the proceedings pending in Calcutta High Court where
the peti- tioner has challenged the adjudication proceedings under the Foreign
Exchange Regulations Act. Any decision of the authorities on the blacklisting
will have no effect on the correctness of any of the facts involved in those
proceedings.
For these reasons, the petitioners succeed. The appeal is dismissed. The
parties will pay and bear their own costs.
    V.P.S.			       Appeal dismissed.
