8\. The above interpretation gets support from the use of the term 'damages',
and not 'rents', in the compromise petition as well as the order of the
Executing Court. The view we have taken gets support also from a decision of
this Court reported in [1968] 2 SCR 559.(1). In that case, the appellant filed
a suit for eviction of the respondent from the appellant's house. The suit was
dismissed by the trial court In appeal compromise was entered into between the
parties and the decree was passed in terms of the compromise. The compromise
provided for the respondent's continuation of possession of the house for five
years, but it enabled the appellant to execute the decree by evicting the
respondent, if the latter failed to pay rent for three consecutive months.
When the appellant sought to evict the respondent, the latter claimed
protection from eviction on the ground that the compromise decree created a
lease. It was held by this Court that the facts that the appellant had filed a
suit for eviction of the respondent and the compromise decree enabled him to
execute the decree by evicting the respondent, showed that the intention of
the parties, which was the decisive test, was not to enter into a relationship
of landlord and tenant.
9- This appeal has no merit and is dismissed with costs.
