the assessee companies business was. in the nature of revenue expenditure
since it was incurred for facilitating the day- to-day trading operations of
the assessee company and enabling the management and conduct of the assessee
company's business to be carried on more efficiently. Lord Reid emphasised in
the course of his speech that the expenditure was incurred by the assessee
company "to remove antiquated restrictions which were preventing profits from
being earned" and on that account held the expenditure to be of revenue
character. It must follow on an analogical reasoning that expenditure incurred
by the assessee in the present case for the purpose of removing a restriction
on the number of working hours for which it could operate the looms, with a
view to increasing its profits, would also be in the nature of revenue
expenditure.
We are therefore of the view that the payment of Rs. 2,03,255/- made by the
assessee for purchase of loom hours represented revenue expenditure and was
allowable as a deduction under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Act. We accordingly
allow the appeal and answer the question referred by the Tribunal in favour of
the assesse and against the Revenue. The Revenue will pay to the assessee
costs throughout.
    S.R.					     Appeal allowed.
