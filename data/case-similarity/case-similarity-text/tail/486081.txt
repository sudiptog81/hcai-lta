contrary taken by the Division Bench cannot be sustained."
From the aforesaid discussion and keeping in view the ratio laid down in
catena of decisions by this Court, it is clear that for the purpose of
deciding whether facts averred by the petitionerappellant, would or would not
constitute a part of cause of action, one has to consider whether such fact
constitutes a material, essential, or integral part of the cause of action. It
is no doubt true that even if a small fraction of the cause of action arises
within the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court would have territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the suit/petition. Nevertheless it must be a 'part
of cause of action', nothing less than than.
In the present case, the facts which have been pleaded by the Appellant
Company, in our judgment, cannot be said to be essential, integral or material
facts so as to constitute a part of 'cause of action' within the meaning of
Article 226(2) of the Constitution. The High Court, in our opinion, therefore,
was not wrong in dismissing the petition.
For the foregoing reasons, we see no infirmity in the order passed by the High
Court dismissing the petition on the ground of want of territorial
jurisdiction. The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed and is
accordingly dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, however, we
leave the parties to bear their own costs.
