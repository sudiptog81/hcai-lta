Q.11 What is the meaning of the expressions "Education" and "Educational
Institutions" in various provisions of the Constitution? Is the right to
establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the
Constitution?
A. The expression "education" in the Articles of the Constitution means and
includes education at all levels from the primary school level up to the post-
graduate level. It includes professional education. The expression
"educational institutions" means institutions that impart education, where
"education" is as understood hereinabove.
The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed
under the Constitution to all citizens under Article 19(1)(g) and 26, and to
minorities specifically under Article 30. All citizens have a right to
establish and administer educational institutions under Articles 19(1)(g) and
26, but this right will be subject to the provisions of Articles 19(6) and
26(a). However, minority institutions will have a right to admit students
belonging to the minority group, in the manner as discussed in this judgment.
