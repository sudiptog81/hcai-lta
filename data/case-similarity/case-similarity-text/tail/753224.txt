expectations, I do not feel obliged to even touch these questions. It needs
also to be added that nothing ever was projected before us on these subjects
as indicated. As stated in the outset we did not have the benefit of a
discussion inter-se on which the desirability of going into these aspects may
have been gone into. The majority has expressed views thereon without alerting
counsel appearing and others concerned. A lot can be said against such views
of the majority out for the present the comment be kept reserved. I would
rather desist conviction on the subject and prefer to remain advised. So, in
my view, on this aspect, the opinion is obitor. Consideration on these points
was wholly unnecessary on the rigid terms of the reference. For such view I am
with respect in disagreement with the majority.
541\. On the question of justiciability of the Judge-strength, I have nothing
useful to add.
542\. While parting with this opinion, I join hands with my learned brethren
in recording my sense of gratitude to the galaxy of men who addressed us at
the bar in this venture, which could aptly be called a labour of love, and to
have enlightened us on the subject with their professional skill, analysis and
wisdom.
543\. I agree to the disposal of the reference leaving however a note of
skepticism - Was it worth it?
