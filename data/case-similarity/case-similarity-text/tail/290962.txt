necessary. As was pointed out in Local Government Board v. Alridge, (1) all
that is required is that the other party shall have an opportunity of
adequately presenting his case. But what the procedure should be in detail
will depend on the nature of the tribunal. There is no doubt that many of the
powers of the Committee under Chap. VI are of administrative nature; but where
quasi- judicial duties are entrusted to administrative body like this it
becomes a quasi-judicial body for performing these duties and it can prescribe
its own procedure so long as the principles of natural justice are followed
and adequate opportunity of presenting his case is given to the examinee. It
is not however necessary to pursue this matter further, for it is not in
dispute that no opportunity whatsoever was given to the respondents in this
case to give an explanation and present their case before the Committee. We
are therefore of opinion that though the view of the High Court that the
Committee was acting merely administratively when proceeding under r. 1 (1) is
not correct, its final decision allowing the writ petition on the ground that
no opportunity was given to the respondents to put forward their cases before
the Committee is correct. We therefore dismiss the appeal. No order as to, in
the circumstances. Appeal dismissed.
