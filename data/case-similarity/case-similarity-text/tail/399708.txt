more than the sum of Rs. 16,500 shown to be the consideration for the property
in the Instrument of Transfer and there was understatement or concealment of
the consideration in respect of the transfer. It was common ground between the
parties and that was a finding of fact reached by the Income-tax Authorities,
that the transfer of the property by the assessee was a perfectly, honest and
bonafide transaction where the full value of the consideration received by the
assessee was correctly disclosed at the figure of Rs. 16,500. Therefore, on
the construction placed by us, subsection (2) had no application to the
present case and the Income-tax officer could have no reason to believe that
any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment so as to justify
the issue of a notice under section 148. The order of re-assessment made by
the Income-tax officer pursuant to the notice issued under section 148 was
accordingly without jurisdiction and the majority judges of the Full Bench
were in error in refusing to quash it.
We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the order passed by the Full Bench
and restore the order of Issac, J. allowing the writ 658 petition and quashing
the order of re-assessment made by the Income-tax officer. The Revenue will
pay the costs of the assessee throughout.
    S.R.				       Appeal allowed.
