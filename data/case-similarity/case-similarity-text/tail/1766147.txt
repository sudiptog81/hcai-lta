considered by the authority and appropriate orders passed. In the result, I
hold that the petitioner is not entitled to any of the fundamental rights
enumerated-in Article 19 of the Constitution and that the Passport Act
complies with the requirements of Art. 21 of the Constitution and is in
accordance with the procedure established by law. I construe section 10(3)(c)
as providing a right to the holder of the passport to be heard before the
passport authority and that any order passed under section 10(3) is subject to
a limited judicial scrutiny by the, High Court and the Supreme Court.
In view of the statement made by the learned Attorney General to which
reference has already been made in judgment, I do not think it necessary to
formally interfere with the impugned order. I accordingly dispose of the Writ
Petition without passing any formal order. There will be no order as to costs.
ORDER Having regard to the majority view, and, in view of the statement made
by the learned Attorney-General to which reference, has already been made in
the judgments we do not think it necessary to formally interfere with the
impugned order. We, accordingly, dispose of the Writ Petition without passing
any formal order. The passport will remain in the custody of the Registrar of
this Court until further orders. There will be no order as to costs.
