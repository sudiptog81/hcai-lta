18\. In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning observed
at pages 712 & 713, "No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be
allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."
In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ observed that fraud vitiates all
transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity. (page
722)
19\. These aspects were recently highlighted in the State of Andhra Pradesh
and Anr. v. T. Suryachandr Rao (2005 (5) SCALE 621)"
Therefore, mere delayed reference when the foundation for the same is alleged
fraud does not in any way affect legality of the reference.
Looked from any angle the High Court's judgment holding that the respondent
no.1-employee was to be reinstated in the same post as originally held is
clearly untenable. The order of termination does not suffer from any infirmity
and the High Court should not have interfered with it. By giving protection
for even a limited period, the result would be that a person who has a
legitimate claim shall be deprived the benefits. On the other hand, a person
who has obtained it by illegitimate means would continue to enjoy it
notwithstanding the clear finding that he does not even have a shadow of right
even to be considered for appointment.
The appeal is allowed but without any order as to costs.
