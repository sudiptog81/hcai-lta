liquidated damages as agreed;
(iii) it was also explicitly understood that the agreed liquidated damages
were genuine pre-estimate of damages;
(iv) on the request of the respondent to extend the time limit for supply of
goods, ONGC informed specifically that time was extended but stipulated
liquidated damages as agreed would be recovered;
(v) liquidated damages for delay in supply of goods were to be recovered by
paying authorities from the bills for payment of cost of material supplied by
the contractor;
(vi) there is nothing on record to suggest that stipulation for recovering
liquidated damages was by way of penalty or that the said sum was in any way
unreasonable.
(vii) In certain contracts, it is impossible to assess the damages or prove
the same. Such situation is taken care by Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract
Act and in the present case by specific terms of the contract.
For the reasons stated above, the impugned award directing the appellant to
refund US $ 3,04,970.20 and Rs.15,75,559/- with interest which were deducted
for the breach of contract as per the agreement requires to be set aside and
is hereby set aside. The appeal is allowed accordingly. There shall be no
order as to costs.
