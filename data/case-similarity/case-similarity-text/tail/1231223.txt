But the stress, which we could spell out cumulatively from the language used
in Explanation VIII, is that the name or mark such as symbol, monogram etc.
should have been used by BHEL for the purpose of indicating or so as to
indicate a connection in the course of trade between the components and BHEL
using such name or mark. It is true that by a bare looking at the inscriptions
or markings or by a bare visual inspection, there need not be an indication of
the identity of BHEL. But fundamentally these markings or inscriptions do not
go to constitute a name or mark of BHEL; ,much less used by BHEL in relation
to such components. There is a faltering with regard to the satisfaction of
the primary ingredient required by Explanation VIII."
Accordingly the High Court allowed the appeals and set aside the order of the
learned single Judge.
For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeals and set aside the order dated
9.6.1998 passed by the CEGAT impugned in these appeals and answer the issues
involved in favour of the appellant and hold that the respondents who are the
manufacturers of plywood under their own brand name M/s Pelican are
disentitled to the benefit of small scale exemption Notification No.175/86-CE
dated 1.3.1986 by using logo indicating "MERINO" on their product along with
their brand name. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there
shall be no order as to costs.
