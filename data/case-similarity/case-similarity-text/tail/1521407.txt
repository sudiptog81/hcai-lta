It is also pointed out that in addition to the retracted confession of the
accused Rajan Tiwari the evidence already brought on record clearly shows that
there has been a test identification parade of the assailants and also other
materials have been brought on record to show that one of the assailants of
Ajit Sarkar was closely known to the respondent and there have been telephonic
conversation to and from the telephone registered in the name of the
respondent which according to the learned counsel would go a long way in
establishing the prosecution case.
It is not necessary for us to weigh the evidence at this stage since we have
already come to the conclusion that the prosecution on the basis of the
material available on record has established a prima facie case against the
accused and we are also of the opinion that the conduct of the respondent-
accused as brought on record clearly indicates that enlarging the said accused
on bail would impede the progress of the trial.
For the reasons recorded hereinabove we are of the considered opinion that the
High Court was totally in error in allowing the bail application of the
respondent by the impugned order. We allow this appeal, quash the impugned
order of the High Court and dismiss the bail application made by the
respondent in Criminal Miscellaneous File No. 9220 of 2004 on the file of the
High Court of Judicature at Patna.
