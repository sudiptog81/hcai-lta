had not expired and that, therefore, it had no jurisdiction.
The schemes made by the Chief Justices under Section 11 cannot govern the
interpretation of Section 11. If the schemes, as drawn, go beyond the terms of
Section 11 they are bad and have to be amended. To the extent that The
Appointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996, goes
beyond Section 11 by requiring, in clause 7, the service of a notice upon the
other party to the arbitration agreement to show cause why the nomination of
an arbitrator, as requested, should not be made, it is bad and must be
amended. The other party needs to be given notice of the request only so that
it may know of it and it may, if it so chooses, assist the Chief Justice or
his designate in the nomination of an arbitrator.
In conclusion, we hold that the order of the Chief Justice or his designate
under Section 11 nominating an arbitrator is not an adjudicatory order and the
Chief Justice or his designate is not a tribunal. Such an order cannot
properly be made the subject of a petition for special leave to appeal under
Article 136. The decision of the three Judge Bench in Konkan Railway
Corporation Ltd. & ors. Vs. Mehul Construction Co. is affirmed. We record our
appreciation of the assistance rendered by the learned Attorney General as
Amicus Curiae.
In the result, the appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.
