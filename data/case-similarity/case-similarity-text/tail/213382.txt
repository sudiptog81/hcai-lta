can be little difficulty in fixing the purchase price of either the cotton-
seeds or the ginned cotton, for the proportion in which they occur in unginned
cotton is known and the market price of the three commodities-unginned cotton,
ginned cotton and cotton-seeds-is also known. Nor can there be any difficulty
in finding out the cost of ginning. All that the Assessing Authority has to do
is to fix the purchase price of the ginned cotton or the cotton-seeds that
have actually been disposed of according to Section 5(2)(vi) of the Punjab
General Sales Tax Act and I can see no great difficulty in that connection, as
the Assessing Authority can certainly call and consider evidence bearing on
the matter.
8\. It is admitted that the assessment orders in these two cases are not in
accordance with the conclusion mentioned above. In one case the Assessing
Authority has deducted the sale price of ginned cotton instead of the purchase
price, while in both the cases the purchase price of cotton-seeds have been
unlawfully ignored and since the error in each case is apparent, these
assessments cannot stand. I would, therefore, allow these petitions with
costs, quash the assessments made and direct that a fresh assessment in each
case be made in accordance with the view expressed above.

9\. I agree.
