purpose of Section 69(2A), the partnership firm will mean the firm as found in
the certificate of registration and the partners as found in the register of
firms maintained as per rule in Form 'G'. The present suit being one for
dissolution and accounts by one of the partners, whose name admittedly finds
place in the Register of Firms alongwith the names of all the appellants, the
requirements of Section 69(2A) are satisfied. Section 4 of the is also
complied with for this limited purpose.
Our conclusion is that on the induction of the second respondent, the existing
firm was only reconstituted on the facts of this case and, therefore, there is
no necessity to get a fresh registration. If by virtue of non-compliance of
certain mandatory provisions in not informing the firm, certain penalties
provided in the Act alone are attracted and that will not lead to the
conclusion that the registration of the firm ceased. This conclusion is based
on a conjoint reading of Sections 58_63 and the form prescribed thereunder.
Further, this conclusion does not in any way militate the object of the
Maharashtra Amendment introduced by Act 29 of 84.
In the result, we hold that the suit in question is not hit by section 69(2A)
of the Act and, therefore, the Division Bench is right in allowing the Appeal.
Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to
costs.
