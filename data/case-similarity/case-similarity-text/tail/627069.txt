can fill up the gaps and supplement the rules and issue instructions not
inconsistent with the rules already framed.
14\. The aforesaid ruling has been reiterated in paragraph 9 of the judgment
by a three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Union of India vs. K.P.
Joseph, (1973) 1 SCC 194, as under:
"Generally speaking, an administrative Order confers no justiciable right, but
this rule, like all other general rules, is subject to exceptions. This Court
has held in Sant Ram Sharma v.
State of Rajasthan and Another, AIR 1967 SC 1910, that although Government
cannot supersede statutory rules by administrative instructions, yet, if the
rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution are silent on any
particular point, the Government can fill up gaps and supplement the rules and
issue instructions not inconsistent with the rules already framed and these
instructions will govern the conditions of service."
15\. For the reasons aforestated, Civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave
Petition (Civil) Nos. 1466 and 2743 of 2006 filed by the successful candidates
are allowed. The impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High
Court is set aside. No costs.
