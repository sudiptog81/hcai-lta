given by the Trial Court which had recorded a finding to the contrary in its
order. The High Court has not at all discussed the considerations which
weighed and the reasons which persuaded the Trial Court in rejecting the
prayer for interim mandatory injunction as prayed for by respondent no.1. Most
importantly, the High Court has not considered the question whether on the
facts and circumstances of the case, if the prayer for interim injunction is
refused the plaintiff/petitioner will suffer irreparable loss which cannot be
adequately compensated by damages. As has been held by this Court in Dorab
Cawasji Warden case (supra), ordinarily the relief to be granted to a
plaintiff in such a matter is awarding of damages and interim injunction of a
mandatory nature is not to be granted.
On consideration of the entire matter, we are satisfied that the order passed
by the High Court granting the prayer for interim injunction, in the context
of facts and circumstances of the case, is unsustainable. Accordingly, the
appeals are allowed. The order dated 5.12.2000 of the High Court in CMA
Nos.3251 and 3255 of 2000 is set aside and the order passed by the Trial Court
in I.A.No.1373 & 1497/2000 in O.S. No.1139 of 2000 dated 06.11.2000 is
restored. It is made clear that the observations made in this judgment will
not in any way affect the merit of the case. In the facts and circumstances of
the case, there will be no orders for costs.
