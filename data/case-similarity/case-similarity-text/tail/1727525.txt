Commissioner of Chhota Nagpur Division found substance in the first
information report, in the investigation done by respondent 6 and his
conclusion, which again was affirmed by D.I.G., Railway, not shown to be
biased. The High Court interfered at the stage where investigation was to be
taken up by an independent agency and, therefore, the so called bias of
respondent 6 becomes wholly irrelevant. It must, however, be pointed out that
if an information is lodged at the police station and an offence is
registered, the mala fide of the informant would be of secondary importance if
the investigation produces unimpeachable evidence disclosing the offence. We,
therefore, consider the aspersions cast on the character of respondent 6 and
the allegations of mala fides made against him virtually accepted by the High
Court in entirety as uttery irrelevant and the same may be treated as expunged
for the purposes of this appeal.
We accordingly allow Criminal Appeal 301/79, quash and set aside the order of
the High Court and restore the order passed by the learned Addl. Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Jamshedpur, dated February 24, 1979. In view of this
order it is not necessary to pass any final order in the cognate appeal
(Criminal Appeal 300/79) preferred by respondent 6.
    V.D.K.				       State Appeal allowed.
