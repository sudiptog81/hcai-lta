legislature and do the least violence to the language used. So read, there
would be clear power under the Act to hold the first general meeting. There
would of course then be no indication as to when this election is to be held
but that would only mean that it has to be held within a reasonable time of
the commencement of the new Act.
The course suggested by me is not without the support of precedents. Thus in
Salmon v. Duncombe (1), the Judicial Committee in construing a statute omitted
from it the words " as if such natural born subject resided in England "
because the retention of those words would have prevented the person
contemplated getting full power to dispose of his immovable property by his
will which it was held, the object of the statute was, he should get.
With regard to the other point argued in this .appeal, namely, whether the
Municipal Committee even if properly constituted, has power to sell the land
mentioned in the petition, I agree, for the reasons mentioned in the judgment
delivered by the majority of the members of the bench, that it has such power
and have nothing to add.
The appeal therefore fails.
Appeal dismissed.
