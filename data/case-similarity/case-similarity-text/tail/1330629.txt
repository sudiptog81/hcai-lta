with regular employees. It was held that by their very nature of employment
they cannot be equated with regular employees. It was held that recruitment
rules and service conditions do not apply to such persons. It was held that
their responsibilities cannot be equated with those of regular employees.
22) Thus it is clear that persons employed on contract cannot claim equal pay
on basis on equal pay for equal work. Faced with this situation it was
submitted that all these persons were in fact claiming that their respective
appointments were regular appointments by the regular process of appointment
but that instead of giving regular appointments they were appointed on
contract with the intention of not paying them regular salary. It was admitted
that the Petitions may be badly drafted and such a contention not put forth
specifically. The High Court has disposed of these Petitions also on the
footing that the principle of equal pay for equal work applied. We therefore
set aside the impugned orders in these cases also and remit the matters back
to the High Court for disposal. The High Court shall permit these Petitioners
to amend their Petitions to make necessary averments and will also permit the
Respondents in these cases to file replies to the amended Petitions.
23) With the above directions all these Appeals stand disposed off. All the
matters are remitted back to the High Court. There will be no order as to
costs.
