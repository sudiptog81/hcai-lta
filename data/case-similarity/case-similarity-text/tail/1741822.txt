establish the presence of mens rea, it is wholly unnecessary to ascertain
whether such a violation was intentional or not. On a careful perusal of
Section 15(D)(b) and Section 15-E of the Act, there is nothing which requires
that mens rea must be proved before penalty can be imposed under these
provisions. Hence once the contravention is established then the penalty is to
follow. In our view, the impugned judgment of the Securities appellate
Tribunal has set a serious wrong precedent and the powers of the SEBI to
impose penalty under Chapter VIA are severely curtailed against the plain
language of the statute which mandatorily imposes penalties on the
contravention of the Act/Regulations without any requirement of the
contravention having been deliberated or contumacious. The impugned order sets
the stage for various market players to violate statutory regulations with
impunity and subsequently plead ignorance of law or lack of mens rea to escape
the imposition of penalty. The imputing mens rea into the provisions of
Chapter VI A is against the plain language of the statute and frustrates
entire purpose and object of introducing Chapter VIA to give teeth to the SEBI
to secure strict compliance of the Act and the Regulations. In the result, the
Civil Appeal Nos. 9523 and 9524 of 2003 are allowed and the order passed by
the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai dated 21.08.2003 in Appeal Nos. 50
and 51 of 2002 are set aside. No costs.
