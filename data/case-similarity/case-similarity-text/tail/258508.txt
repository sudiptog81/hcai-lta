is significant that in his' amendment petition, the petitioner has not stated
the extent of the rent which he is required to pay for his land holdings. He
holds the lands as Bhumidar and the respondents contend that the rent
recovered from Bhumidars is very low. It was even suggested during the course
of argument by Mr. Aggarwal that the rent recovered from the Bhumidars would
not exceed 1% of the gross income and in some cases, it may even be less.
Unfortunately, the petitioner has not made any statement I about this
important particular. The operation of the rates prescribed by the Schedule is
based on the annual valuation of the lands, and the said valuation is
determined ultimately on the basis of the rent, so that unless the rent is
known, the extent of the impost cannot be adequately judged. Therefore, ,in
our opinion, on the material added by the petitioner before us, it is
impossible to accept the 242 argument that the tax levied by the Act is
confiscatory. Besides, as we have already seen, the scheme of the present Act
does not disclose any constitutional infirmity either in its charging sections
or in the sections providing for the procedure for the levy of the tax and its
recovery. That is why we feel no hesitation in holding that there is no
substance in the plea that the Act is a colorable piece of legislation.
In the result,the petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
Petition dismissed.
