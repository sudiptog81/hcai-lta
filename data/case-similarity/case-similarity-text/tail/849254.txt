The Area Inspector, after due examination, reported that the balance sheet,
income-tax and sales tax registration numbers, and provident fund account for
both the units are one and the same. Thus there is not only unity of ownership
but also unity of management and also to a great extent functional integrality
including the unity of employment. In the face of this wide coverage of the
common features, I have absolutely no hesitation in concluding that Visakha
Cement Works is a branch of the petitioner-Company and, therefore, cannot
claim the benefit of exemption as postulated under Section 16 of the Employees
Provident Fund Act for the infancy benefit. This is so notwithstanding the
fact that Visakha Cement Works has been registered separately, licensed
separately, granted interest-free sales tax loans as well as a rebate of 25%
in power tariff and also recognised by the Commissioner of Labour as a
separate unit, as these cannot be reckoned as contributing factors to be taken
as guidelines in finding whether the unit is a separate establishment or a
branch of the main unit.
25\. Hence in any judgment, the impugned order does not suffer from any
erroneous approach and so warrants no interference by certiorarising the same.
Resultantly, since the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner-
Company are devoid of merit and substance and so deserve to be rejected, the
writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
