it fit to consider as to whether in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article
142 of the Constitution of India a direction should be issued directing the
Board to forbear from proceeding under Section 15H of the Act against the
Appellant. It is accepted that once a public offer is made the investors would
be entitled to elect to transfer their shares at a higher price which may be
offered by the acquirer with a view to acquire control over the target
company. The investors would also be entitled to interest at such rate as the
Board may determine. The provisions of Section 15H of the Act mandates that a
penalty of rupees twenty-five crore may be imposed. The Board does not have
any discretion in the matter and, thus, the adjudication proceeding is a mere
formality. Imposition of penalty upon the Appellant would, thus, be a forgone
conclusion. Only in the criminal proceedings initiated against the Appellants,
existence of mens rea on the part of the Appellants will come up for
consideration.
We, therefore, are of the opinion that it is a fit case where this Court
should exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to
direct the Board to forbear from proceedings with the adjudication proceeding
against the Appellants. This may not, however, be treated to be a precedent.
These appeals are allowed in part and to the extent mentioned hereinbefore. In
the facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs.
