Court observed as followed:

Thus in the instant case as two views were reasonably possible and therefore
tile High Court was in error in disturbing the order of acquittal passed the
Sessions Judge.
For The reasons given above, we are satisfied that the High Court was not at
all justified in reversing the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions
Judge. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the conviction and sentence passed
against the appellants are set aside and they are acquitted of the charges
framed against them. The appellants are directed to be set at liberty
forthwith.
M.R.Appeal allowed.
