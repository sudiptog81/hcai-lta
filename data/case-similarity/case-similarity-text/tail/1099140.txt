having regard to the lapse of several years on account of the pendency of the
litigation before different Courts, it would not be appropriate to direct the
process initiated in 1989 to be completed more than 11 years later. The
vacancy created by the setting aside the appellant's appointment will have to
be filled and a fresh advertisement will have to be issued by NIMHANS in
accordance with its Cadre and Recruitment Rules. The unfortunate consequence
that the appellant will suffer by reason of the setting aside of his
appointment as Assistant Professor in NIMHANS cannot be avoided on any
equitable considerations although the harshness may be mitigated to some
extent.
Accordingly, while affirming the decision of the High Court, we modify it to
the extent that the actual experience gained by the appellant by virtue of his
appointment as Assistant Professor may be taken into account if the appellant
applies pursuant to any future advertisement that may be issued by NIMHANS for
the post of Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatric Social Work.
With this modification, the appeals are dismissed but without any order as to
costs.
