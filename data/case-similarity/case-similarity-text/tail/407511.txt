that two accused persons walked into the court of a magistrate and wanted to
make a confession. The magistrate called a petition-writer and the accused
persons dictated an application to him and that was taken down by the
petition-writer and signed by them. That petition was admitted in evidence
under s. 21 of the Evidence Act. It was held, and we think rightly, that Nazir
Ahmed's case(5) did not prevent the petition being admitted in evidence
because it only forbade certain oral (1) L.R. 77 I.A. 65. (2) L.R. 73 I.A.I.

evidence being given. This case turned on wholly different facts and is of no
assistance.
We may also refer to, In re Natesan (1) where it was observed that the
decision in Nazir Ahmed's case(2) might require reconsideration in view of the
observations of this Court in Willie Slaney v. The State of Madhya Pradesh(3).
The actual decision in In re Natesan(4) does not affect the question before us
and with regard to the aforesaid observation made in it we think it enough on
the present occasion to say that we are unable to accept it as correct. We
think that the High Court in the present case rightly rejected the oral
evidence of Mr. Dixit.
The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed. Appeal dismissed.
