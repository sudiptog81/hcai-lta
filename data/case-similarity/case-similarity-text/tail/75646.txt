para 9 of the memorandum, the termination of service was not automatic, cannot
be accepted.
The High Court in passing the impugned order took support of the judgment of
this Court in Regional Manager, Bank of Baroda vs. Presiding Officer, Central
Government Industrial Tribunal and another [(1999) 2 SCC 247]. The very
judgment specifically stated, thus:-
"We make it clear that this order of ours is rendered on the peculiar facts
and circumstances of the case as mentioned earlier and will not be treated as
a precedent in future."
It is unfortunate that the High Court treated the said judgment as a precedent
despite this Court's saying that it will not be treated as a precedent in
future, while confining the said judgment to the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case. In view of what is stated above and taking note of
the facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to accept the
argument of the learned counsel for the respondent that this Court may not
disturb the impugned order exercising jurisdiction under Article 136 of the
Constitution of India.
In our considered view, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court
cannot be sustained. Hence, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is
set aside and the order passed by the Tribunal is restored. No costs.
