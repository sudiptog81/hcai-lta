later by this Court in several cases(3), to a Magistrate making a record under
ss. 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. This rule squarely
applies "where, indeed, the whole aim and object of the legislature would be
plainly defeated if the command to do the thing in a particular manner did not
imply a prohibition to do it in any other.(4)" The rule will be attracted with
full force in the present case because non-verification of the surrender in
the requisite manner would frustrate the very purpose of this provision.
Intention of the legislature to prohibit the verification of the surrender in
a manner other than the one prescribed, is implied in these provisions.
Failure to comply with these mandatory provisions, therefore, had vitiated the
surrender and rendered it non-est for the purpose of s. 5 (3) (b).
For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the
appeals with one set of costs. P.B.R.
