petitioner's case was rejected. It was held by the High Court that the power
conferred on the State Government by s. 5(3) of the impugned Act, the Bombay
Service Inam (Useful to the Community) Abolition Act, 1953, was not arbitrary
nor was its exercise in this particular case unreasonable, or arbitrary. The
High Court also held that the land of the petitioner attracted the relevant
provisions of the said impugned statute. Mr. Ayyangar 'for the petitioner
realised the difficulties in his way, and so he attempted to argue that the
contentions which he wanted to raise in his present petition are put in a
different form, and in support of this argument he has invited am attention to
grounds 8 and 10 framed by him in paragraph X of the petition. We are
satisfied that a change in the form of attack against the impugned statute
would make no difference to the true legal position that the writ petition in
the High Court and the present writ petition are directed against the same
statute and the grounds raised by the petitioner in that behalf are
substantially the same. Therefore the decision of the High Court pronounced by
it on the merits of the petitioner's writ petition under Art. 226 is a bar to
the making of the present petition, under Art. 32. In the result this writ
petition fails and is dismissed. There would be no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
