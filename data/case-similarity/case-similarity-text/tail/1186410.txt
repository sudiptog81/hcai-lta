The restraint may not be greater than necessary to protect the employer, nor
unduly harsh and oppressive to the employee. I would, therefore, for my part,
even if the word 'leave' contained in clause 10 of the agreement is
susceptible of another construction as being operative on termination,
however, accomplished of the service e.g. by dismissal without notice, would,
having regard to the provisions of Section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872, try
to preserve the covenant in clause 10 by giving to it a restrictive meaning,
as implying volition i.e. where the employee resigns or voluntarily leaves the
services. The restriction being too wide, and violative of section 27 of the
Contract Act, must be subjected to a narrower construction.
In the result, the appeal must fail and is dismissed but there shall be no
order as to costs.
    S.R.					   Appeal dismissed.
