junction of these three Mohallas. The Food Inspector states that it is
situated in the corner of Sapri Mohalla. Much has been made by the trial Court
about the fact that the witnesses talk of three different Mohallas and so it
is not proved at what place the sample was taken. The judgment shows that the
prosecution had advanced an argument that all the three Mohallas are situated
adjoining to the shop of Chatru and the shop could be described in three
Mohallas as the witnesses have done. Instead of finding out the fact even by
inspecting the place where Chatru's shop is situated the learned Magistrate
decided to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the place where the
sample was taken. As the place of taking the sample is established as Chatru's
shop by all the three witnesses, it was immaterial whether it was situated in
one or the other Mohalla. I have, therefore no hesitation in holding that the
sample was duly taken by the Food Inspector at the shop of Chatru. Halwai.
