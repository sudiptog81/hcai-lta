that no novation was proved so as to enable the appellant to riggle out of the
liability under the loan transaction. The High Court has not interfered with
the reasoning and conclusion of the trial court on this aspect and has in fact
proceeded to grant the plaintiff Bank a decree for the suit amount based on
the equitable mortgage. We were taken through Exhibits D1 to D4 and even a
fresh document attempted to be marked in this Court along with its counter
affidavit by the Bank. On going through the said documents, the other evidence
and the reasoning adopted by the trial court, we are satisfied that there is
no evidence to show that there was a tripartite agreement on the basis of
which the appellant could disclaim liability based on it. It is seen that the
appellant has not even examined Fernandes in support of the plea of the
tripartite arrangement and the taking over of the liability of the appellant,
by him. In this situation, we see no reason to uphold the plea of the
appellant that the liability has been transferred to Fernandes at the instance
of the Bank and that the appellant was no more liable for the plaint amount.
16\. Thus, on a consideration of all the relevant aspects, we are satisfied
that the High Court was correct in granting the Bank a decree in the suit.
There is therefore no reason to interfere with that decree. We therefore
confirm the judgment and decree of the High Court and dismiss this appeal with
costs.
