cannot be said that the returns are not filed on or before the due date.
5\. The admitted facts are that returns are due to be filed on or before
30-6-1985. On 28-6-1985, the assessee had filed the application in Form No. 6
for extension of time till September, 1985, and returns showing loss has been
filed on 5-8-1985, as before 30-9-1985. The consistent view taken by various
High Courts that once the assessee has applied for extension of time in Form
No. 6 and if that application has not been disposed of or rejected, the
presumption will be that the time has been extended and if assessee has filed
the return on or before the extended time prayed for, the return shall be
taken to be filed on or before due date. In this case, when the application
has been submitted for extension of time on 28-6-1985, and that has not been
rejected, it shall be presumed that the time has been extended till 30-9-1985,
and in this case, admittedly the returns are filed on 5-8-1985, therefore, it
cannot be said that the returns are not filed on or before the due date.
In our view, the Tribunal has committed error in disallowing the claim of the
assessee holding that returns are not filed on or before the due date.
In the result, we answer the question in negative i.e., in favour of the
assessee and against the revenue.
The reference so made stands disposed of accordingly.
