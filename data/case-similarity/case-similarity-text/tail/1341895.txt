" It is trite law that a taxing statute has to be strictly construed and
nothing can be read into it. In the classic passage from Cape Brandy
Syndicate, (1921) 1 KB 64,71 which was noticed in the judgment under appeal,
it was said :
"In a taxing Act one has to look merely at which is clearly said. There is no
room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no
presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.
One can look fairly at the language used."
This view has been reiterated by this Court time and again. Thus, in State of
Bombay v. Automobile and Agricultural Industries Corpn (1961) 12 STC 122, this
Court said:
"But the courts in interpreting a taxing statute will not be justified in
adding words thereto so as to make out some presumed object of the
legislature. If the legislature has failed to clarify its meaning by the use
of appropriate language, the benefit thereof must go to the tax payers. It is
settled law that in case of doubt, that interpretation of a taxing statute
which is beneficial to the taxpayer must be adopted".
21.In view of the aforesaid discussion the reference is answered in
affirmative and in favor of the assessed and against the revenue.
The reference is disposed of accordingly.
