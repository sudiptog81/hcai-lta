aim and object of this expenditure is not to bring into existence any asset or
enduring advantage or benefit for the assessee's business but to produce
profits in the conduct of its business. The assessee has acquired a mere non-
exclusive licence to use these assets belonging to the foreign company and
that too is terminable at any moment on a reasonable notice by either party or
by the foreign company in terms of the article already mentioned.
71\. Moreover, an expenditure incurred for acquiring a mere benefit is not a
capital expenditure. And on no commercial or legal principle it can be said
that by the payment of this amount the assessee has acquired or brought into
existence an asset or an enduring advantage or benefit for its business. The
assessee has incurred this expenditure wholly and exclusively for the purposes
of its business, namely, to produce profits in the conduct of its business and
this expenditure, not being of a capital nature, must be regarded as a revenue
expenditure.
72\. We, accordingly, answer the question in the negative and in favour of the
assessee.
    73. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case an    the
    valuable assistance rendered at the Bar, we do not  propose  to make any order as to costs. 
     Sudhindra Mohan Guha, J. 
    74. I agree.
