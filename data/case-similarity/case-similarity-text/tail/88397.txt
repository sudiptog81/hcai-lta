so read as applying to Universities established in India, or at least
providing educational facilities in India. I find no unjustness,
unreasonableness, irrationality or absurdity in the provisions of clause (22).
It does not strike me as being beyond the bounds of possibility that
Parliament should be willing to forego a very small percentage of tax revenue
for the purposes of education, even though it might mean the education of
people outside India, if that education was being provided by a University or
other educational institution whose sole purpose was to provide education and
not at all to make a profit. I do not think Parliament could not possibly have
meant what clause (22) so plainly says. I see, therefore, no reason to read
clause (22) in a fashion that is not literal.
It should be noticed that clause (22A), which also gives an exemption without
any limitation as to location, was introduced into Section 10 in 1970. It
cannot be that Parliament yet again failed to express its true intendment. If
Parliament had meant to provide an exemption with a locational limitation in
clause (22A) it would have made it clear, and it would have amended clause
(22).
The judgment and order under challenge cannot stand, and the question quoted
above must be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee. The
appeals are allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.
