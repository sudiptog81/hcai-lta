suit, the objection cannot be raised in the execution proceeding.
The High Court was of the view that where there is lack of inherent
jurisdiction in the Court which passed the decree, the executing Court must
refuse to execute it on the ground that the decree is a nullity. But, in our
judgment, for the purpose of determining whether the Court which passed the
decree had jurisdiction to try the suit, it is necessary to determine facts on
the decision of which the question depends', and the objection does not appear
on the face of the record, the executing Court cannot enter upon and enquiry
into those facts. In the view of the High Court since the land leased was at
the date of the lease used for agricultural purposes and that it so appeared
on investigation of the terms of the lease and other relevant evidence, it was
open to the Court to hold that the decree was without jurisdiction and on that
account a nullity. The view taken by the High Court, in our judgment, cannot
be sustained.
The appeal is 'Allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside.
The order of the Court of Small Causes is restored. The respondent Munshi will
pay the costs of the appellant throughout.
R.K.P.S.
Appeal allowed.
