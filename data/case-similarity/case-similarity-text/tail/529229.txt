not find any rationale in adopting the policy as indicated on behalf of the
respondent. So far the interview fixed as the sole criterion in the present
case according to the impugned judgment is concerned, the same in absence of a
guideline leaves the matter to the whims of the individual officer holding the
interview. The exercise of such unbridled power, will be clearly violative of
Article
14\. The policy referred to by  785 by the State counsel as contained in one
of the Government Orders and relied upon before us in support of the impugned
judgment, therefore, must held to be unconstitutional.
8\. In the circumstances, the settlement in favour of the respondent No.1 is
quashed, the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the judgment of the
Collector having the support of the advertisement in question is restored. We
expect that the State, after taking into consideration all the legal and
relevant aspects, shall expeditiously take a decision and issue an appropriate
Order dealing with settle- ment of fair price shops, and not follow the
unconstitution- al instruction relied upon before us. The appeal is accord-
ingly allowed, but in the circumstances the parties are directed to bear their
own costs.
    G.N.					  Appeal allowed.
