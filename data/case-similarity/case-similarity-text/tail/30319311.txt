4\. Learned Senior counsel submits that the petitioner has prayed to permit
him to file nomination but the same was denied. Hence, he has filed this writ
petition quash Annexure-F dated 16.12.2016 and to direct the respondent to
accept the nomination to contest the election which is scheduled to
12.01.2017.
5\. Learned Additional Advocate General and also learned counsel for
respondent No.3 prayed to dismiss the petition and submits that the petitioner
cannot challenge Annexure-F since he has no grievance and he has not filed  4
any nomination either pursuant to the 1st or the 2nd notification. Annexure-F
was issued in respect of the other constituency other than Shidlagatta which
was permitted in the nature of direction in the earlier petition.
6\. Annexure-F notification relates to conduct of election of Chickballapur,
Gowribidanur, Bagepalli and Chintamani Agricultural produce marketing
committees. In the earlier order the Deputy Commissioner was directed to
continue the election process from the stage where it was stopped. Petitioner
is now seeking to permit him to file nomination. That stage having already
passed through, not a case for interference.
Hence writ petition is rejected.
