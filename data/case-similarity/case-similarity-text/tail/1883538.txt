confusion or deception arising therefrom would appear from the fact stated by
the appellant that it received from a tradesman an enquiry for biscuits
manufactured by it under its mark 'Glucovita'. The tradesman making the
enquiry apparently thought that the manufacturer of 'Glucovita' glucose was
likely to manufacture biscuits with glucose; he did not worry whether biscuits
were made with powder or liquid glucose. Then again it is stated in one of the
affidavits filed by the appellant that the respondent's director told the
appellant's manager that the respondent had adopted the name 'Gluvita' to
indicate that in the manufacture of its biscuits glucose was used. Those
statements of behalf of the appellant are not denied by the respondent. So, a
trade connection between glucose and biscuits would appear to be established.
We are therefore of opinion that the commodities concerned in the present case
are so connected as to make confusion or deception likely in view of the
similarity of the two trade marks. We think that the decision of Desai, J.,
was right.
24\. In the result, we set aside the order of the learned appellate Judges of
the High Court and restore that of Desai, J. The appeal is accordingly
allowed. The appellant will get the costs before the appellate Judges in this
High Court and in this Court.
25\. Appeal allowed.
