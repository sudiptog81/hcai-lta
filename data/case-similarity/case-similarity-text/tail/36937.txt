Notification issued thereunder do not suffer from the vice of excessive
delegation of legislative power.
We may at this stage refer to one other subsidiary argument urged on behalf of
the appellants. It is argued that because paddy and rice are not different
kinds of goods but one and the same, inclusion of both paddy and rice in
Schedule 'C' to the Act would amount to imposition of double taxation under
the Act. There is no merit in this contention also because the assumption that
paddy and rice are one and the same is erroneous. In Ganesh Trading Co.,
Karnal v. State of Haryana & Anr. arising under the Act, this Court has held
that although rice is produced out of paddy, it is not true to say that paddy
continued to be paddy even after dehusking; that rice and paddy are two
different things in ordinary parlance and therefore, when paddy is dehusked
and rice produced, there is a change in the identity of the goods. The above
decision follows the principle enunciated by this Court in State of Punjab v.
Chandu Lal Kishori Lal in which it was held that cotton seeds when separated
from cotton constituted distinct commercial goods different from cotton. The
above contention has, therefore, to be rejected.
In the result these appeals fail and they are dismissed. The parties shall,
however, bear their own costs. N.K.A. Appeals dismissed.
