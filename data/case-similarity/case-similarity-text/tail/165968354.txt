which was also taken note of by the Original Authority.
3\. We have heard both the sides and examined the appeal records. We find the
decided cases relied upon by the appellants were not available for the
Original Authority when he decided the case. Further, the appellants have made
out a strong case with documentary evidences regarding transfer of materials
during the provision of service by them. Prima facie, the work executed by
them will be covered under works contract service. The applicability of
decided cases relied upon by the appellant and also the documents submitted by
the appellants require verification for a fresh decision by the Original
Authority. We find this as a fit case for remanding to the Original Authority
for a denovo decision, in view of the above observations. The impugned order
is set aside. Due opportunity will be provided to the appellants to submit
their side of the case alongwith supporting evidences. The appeal is disposed
of by way of remand.
