vii) The complainant as well as Shri C.B. Gajjar, Advocate had been talking
about the appellant’s husband having collecting the amount on behalf of the
appellant, for deciding the cases, though at that point of time, she was
unmarried.
viii) There is nothing on record to show that the appellant whose defence has
been disbelieved in toto, had ever been given any adverse entry in her ACRs,
or punished earlier in any enquiry. While she has been punished solely on
uncorroborated statement of an accused facing trial for misappropriation.
30\. In view of the above, we have no option except to allow the appeal. The
appeal succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The order of punishment imposed by
the High Court in compulsorily retiring the appellant is set aside. However,
as the appellant has already reached the age of superannuation long ago, it is
not desirable under the facts and circumstances of the case, to grant her any
substantive relief, except to exonerate her honourably of all the charges, and
allow the appeal with costs, which is quantified to the tune of Rs.5 lacs. The
State of Gujarat is directed to pay the said cost to the appellant within a
period of 3 months from today.
