event. The person who transfers possession of the property to the second party
still remains the legal owner of the property and the person in whose favour
possession is so transferred has only the custody of the property to be kept
or disposed of by him for the benefit of the other party....
The appellant also relies on a decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court:
Akharbhai Nazarali v. Md. Hussain Bhoi . This was a case under the Employees'
Provident Funds Act. The following observation occurs on page 39 of the
report:
It may be that the deduction and retention of the employees' contribution is a
trust crested by virtue of that very fact, or by virtue of a provision in
statute or statutory rule. But even apart from the latter, the more fact of
telling the employees that it is their contribution to the provident fund
scheme and then making a deduction or recovery and retaining it, constitutes
the offence of criminal breach of trust.
3\. This, in our opinion, is a correct statement of the position and we also
agree with the learned Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court that "this is so
obvious that nothing more need be said about it." We therefore think that the
impugned order quashing the charge against the respondents is obviously wrong.
The appeal is allowed, the order complained of is set aside: as this is an old
case, the trial shall be expedited.
