enquiry. The respondent had full notice of the charge against him, and he
examined witnesses in support of his defence and made several argumentative
representations before the Deputy Inspector General, the Inspector General of
Police and the Government of Andhra Pradesh. In our Judgment the proceedings
before the departmental authorities were regular and were not vitiated on
account of any breach of the rules of natural justice. The conclusions of the
departmental 37 officers were fully borne out by the evidence before them and
the High Court had no jurisdiction to set aside the order either on the ground
that the "approach to the evidence was not consistent with the approach in a
criminal case," nor on the ground that the High Court would have on that
evidence come to a different conclusion. The respondent had also ample
opportunity of examining his witnesses after he was informed of the charge
against him. The conclusion recorded by the punishing authority was therefore
not open to be canvassed, nor was the liability of the respondent to be
punished by removal from service open to question before the High Court.
The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The
petition filed by the respondent is dismissed. There will be no order as to
costs. The order as to costs passed by the High Court will stand.
Appeal allowed.
