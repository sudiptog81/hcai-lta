they be explained by any demonstrable legal principle but in fact they run
counter to the established legal principle.
In the present case the legal representatives of deceased Y. Prabrakar Reddy
were brought on record in the claimants' appeal. Through their advocate they
were contending before the High Court that not only the compensation should be
enhanced but in reply to the submissions of the counsel for the State in their
appeal they contended that no case was made out for reducing the compensation.
Both the appeals were heard together and not one after the other. Therefore,
the legal representatives of the deceased Y. Prakhakar Reddy were all
throughout before the Court, of course in one capacity, viz., as legal
representatives of deceased appellant, but not so described as legal
representatives of the deceased respondent. That cannot make any difference.
Therefore, the appeal has not abated.
On merits, I agree with my learned brother Shinghal, J. that the compensation
as awarded by the High Court represents the market value of the land on the
date of the Notification under  s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act and no case
is made out for interfering with the same. Accordingly, I agree with the final
order that the appeal be dismissed with no order as to costs.
    P.B.R.					   Appeal dismissed.
