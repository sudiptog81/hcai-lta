and 77(l) of the Indian Registration Act XVI of 1908. It was held that in a
case where an order was not passed in the presence of the parties or after
notice to them of the date when the order would be passed the expression
"within thirty days after the making of the order" used in the said sections
means within thirty days after the date on which the communication of the
order reached the parties affected by it. These decisions show that where the
rights of a person are affected by any order and limitation is prescribed for
the enforcement of the remedy by the person aggrieved against the said order
by reference to the making of the said order, the making of the order must
mean either actual or constructive communication of the said order to the
party concerned. Therefore, we are satisfied that the High Court of Allahabad
was in error in coming to the conclusion that the application made by the
appellant in the present proceedings was barred under the proviso to s. 18 of
the Act.
In the result we allow the appeal, set aside the orders passed by Mootham, C.
J. and Chaturvedi, J., and restore those of Mehrotra, J. In the circumstances
of this case there would be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
