discharged thereupon. The deposit has been made with the Registrar, Original
Side.
The present petition is for a direction on the Registrar to make over the
entire amount held by the Registrar to the first defendant since the suit has
been dismissed by an order of September 12, 2012.
Since the plaintiff has shown no interest in the matter despite attempts of
service at the plaintiff's recorded address and the publication of the notice
in the  3 newspaper pursuant to the order dated January 29, 2016, GA No.3420
of 2015 is allowed by directing the Registrar, Original Side to make over the
deposit of about Rs.1.75 crore together with the interest accrued thereon to
the first defendant by way of a demand draft of any nationalised bank made out
in the name of the first defendant. The entire payment will be made within
four weeks from date, upon the Registrar retaining the usual commission.
It is made clear that this order is only for the purpose of the refund of the
amount and it will be open to the first defendant to pursue any other remedy
against the plaintiff in accordance with law.
There will be no order as to costs.
Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be supplied to
the parties subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
