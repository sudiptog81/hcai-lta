of finality for more than a decade would be unsettled. Persons who have been
appointed on the basis of the subsequent examination has to give way to
appellant - Ashwani Kumar Singh. Though they had been impleaded but did not
appear, it does not mean that something which is not permissiole in law has to
be done. It would not be fair to disturb the prevailing position. It was
pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant - Ashwani Kumar Singh that he
has already been promoted as Accounts Officer, and the only question left is
of his seniority over those who were subsequently appointed. This plea is
without any substance. Since he has been promoted later on, in the absence of
any statutory prescription, person who has been appointed to the higher post
earlier would be logically senior to him. The High Court was, therefore,
justified in rejecting the writ petition filed by the appellant - Ashwani
Kumar Singh. So far as the other appellant - Brij Nath Srivastava is a
concerned, his claim is based on almost identical premises as that of Ashwani
Kumar Singh. His name was far below in the select list. Therefore, he does not
have a better case than that of appellant - Ashwani Kumar Singh whose stand
has been negatived. Though he claims to be candidate belonging to the backward
class, the posts have been filled up and his name finds place much below the
zone of selected candidates. Both the appeals deserve dismissal, which we
direct. However, parties shall bear their respective costs.
