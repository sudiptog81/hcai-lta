29\. What then would be meant by a composite suit? A composite suit would not
entitle a court to entertain a suit in respect whereof it has no jurisdiction,
territorial or otherwise. Order II Rule 3 of the Code specifically states so
and, thus, there is no reason as to why the same should be ignored. A
composite suit within the provisions of the 1957 Act as considered in Dhoda
House (supra), therefore, would mean the suit which is founded on infringement
of a copy right and wherein the incidental power of the Court is required to
be invoked. A plaintiff may seek a remedy which can otherwise be granted by
the court. It was that aspect of the matter which had not been considered in
Dhoda House (supra) but it never meant that two suits having different causes
of actions can be clubbed together as a composite suit.

30\. For the reasons aforementioned we do not find any merit in this appeal
which fails and is dismissed with costs. Counsel's fee assessed at
Rs.50,000/-.
