Learned Counsel has also drawn our attention to a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court passed in the case of Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma Vs State of
Bihar & Another reported in 2000 C Cr. LR (SC) 293 in support of his
contention that in the face of the allegations, an offence under Section 420
and/or the other sections is not made out as there is a civil dispute.
Considering the aforementioned submissions and also the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs State of Bihar
reported in 2014 (5) Supreme 324 = AIR 2014 SC 2756 and specially paragraph 14
thereof, we are of the view that the Petitioners, in the event of their
arrest, should be enlarged on bail.
Accordingly, we direct that in the event of arrest, the Petitioners shall be
released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten
Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount, one of whom must be
local, to the satisfaction of the arresting officer and also subject to the
conditions laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 and on further condition that the Petitioners will both meet
not the Investigating Officer, but the Officer-in-charge of the concerned
police station so that the investigation is not hampered in any way.
The application for anticipatory bail stands allowed.
