Mr. Mishra upon reliance in Dr. Sharmas case (supra) also contended that
Section 24 of the I.P.C has defined the word dishonesty to mean a deliberate
intent to cause wrongful gain or wrongful loss. It has been the specific case
of the complainant that from the beginning of the transaction there was a
definite intent on the part of the accused persons to cause wrongful loss to
the complainant. This aspect of the matter, however, has not been taken note
of by the learned Single Judge. The decision of this Court in Dr. Sharmas case
(supra) thus does not lend any assistance to Mr. Mishra in support of quashing
of the criminal complaint. Some other decisions have also been cited but we do
not feel it inclined to refer to the same except one noted above since they do
not advance the case of the respondents in any way whatsoever. Considering the
factual aspect of the matter, we unhesitatingly state, however, that the issue
involved in the matter under consideration is not a case in which the criminal
trial should have been short circuited. We, thus, without expressing any
opinion on the merits of the case allow the Appeal and set aside the impugned
order of the High Court and restore the complaint. The learned trial
Magistrate shall proceed with the complaint and dispose of the same in
accordance with the law with utmost expectation. Be it clarified however that
observations as above in this judgment be not taken as an expression of
opinion of ours.
