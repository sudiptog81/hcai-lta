This being a manda- tory provision and having not been complied with the
deten- tion order even if 123 otherwise it was in force, cannot be said to
have been in force after three weeks. Under Article 22 of the Constitu- tion
of India a person cannot be kept in detention beyond three months without
referring his case to an Advisory Board under the appropriate law. In either
case the appellant's case having not been referred to an Advisory Board the
detention order cannot be said to have remained in force after the statutory
period. It is, therefore, not necessary to go into the validity or otherwise
of the grounds of detention.
In the result we set aside the impugned Judgment of the High Court and hold
that the detention order ceased to be in force after 12 days of making thereof
and even if it was in force it ceased to be in force for failure to refer the
appellant's case to Advisory Board within the time pre- scribed by law; and
accordingly we quash the same. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
After the Judgment was finalised, another affidavit on behalf of the
respondents affirmed by one belonging to the office of the Advocate-on-Record
has been circulated. This affidavit is not acceptable. Even if it was accepted
it would not affect the ultimate legal position.
    R.S.S.				       Appeal allowed.
