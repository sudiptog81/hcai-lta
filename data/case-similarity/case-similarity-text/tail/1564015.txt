State is not imposing rates of tax on imported goods different from rates of
tax on goods manufactured or produced,Art. 304 has no application". Here also
the tax is at the same rate and therefore the tax cannot be said to be higher
in the case of imported goods. It may be that when the rate is applied the
resulting tax is somewhat higher but that does not offend against the equality
contemplated by Art. 304. That is the consequence of ad valorem tax being
levied at a particular rate. So long as the rate is the same Art.304 is
satisfied. Even in the case of local manufactures if their cost of production
varies, the net tax collected will be more or less in some cases but that does
not create any inequality because inequality is not the result of the tax but
results from the cost of production of the goods or the 'cost of their
importation. This ground, therefore, has also no substance. We do not think it
necessary to set down here the provisions of the Haryana Amendment Act because
they follow the scheme of the Punjab Amendment Act in substance and what we
have said in regard to the Punjab Amending Act applies mutatis mutandis to
Haryana Amendment Act also. In the result these petitions have no substance.
They are dismissed with costs. One set of hearing fee.
