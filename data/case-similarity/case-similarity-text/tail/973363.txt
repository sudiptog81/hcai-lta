be deprivation of "property" which would require the authority of law. I am
aware of the possible criticism that in two parts of the same article the same
word must be intended to have been used in the same sense. While this is a
normal rule of construction, it can yield to the requirement of the context
arising from the' juxtaposition of other words or phrases. To my' mind article
31 (1), though part of an article is in essence1 an independent provision to
some extent overlapping with the requirements of the law 674 of Eminent
Domain. It is on a par with article 21. It seems to me to serve a distinct
purpose over and above that relating to the law of Eminent Domain, viz., that
it relates also to deprivation of property other than that which may fall
within the scope of article 31 (2). It enjoins that such deprivation shall not
be brought about save by authority of law.
In view of what I have said above, it follows that the assumption with which I
have started, viz., that this is a case falling under article 19 (1) (f) and
(5) is, in my opinion, correct.
In the result I agree that the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in
the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
