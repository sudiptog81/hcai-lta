agreement. A formal lease is not necessary to attract the application of S.
53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. All that is required is that an
agreement in writing signed by the transferor can be gath- ered from the
evidence. The correspondence mentioned in Ex. 181 fully establishes that fact.
We are therefore of the opinion that the learned Assist- ant Judge rightly
dismissed the plaintiff's suit and the High Court was in error in interfering
with that decision in second appeal. The result therefore is that the appeal
is allowed, the decision of the Assistant Judge restored and that of the High
Court reversed.The circumstances of the case are such that we would make no
order as to costs. The defendant was at fault in not producing all the
documentary evidence at the proper stage of the case and he has been enabled
to avail himself of the defence furnished to him under  S. 53-A by reason of
the admission in evidence after remand of Ex. 181, which though not properly
admitted at that stage was not rejected by the High Court and could not be
rejected at the stage when we dealt with the case. The parties are therefore
left to bear their own costs through- out.
Appeal allowed.
Agent for the appellant: S.P. Varma.
Agent for the respondent: Ganpat Rai.
