under Section 111, then he shall be liable to conviction under Sub-section (1)
thereof and shall be liable to punishment under subsection (2) thereof.
Similarly, under the Gold (Control) Act, which was in operation at the
relevant time, whoever in contravention of the provisions of that Act or order
made thereunder, among other things, owns or has in his possession, custody or
control any primary gold, is liable, without prejudice to any other action
that may be taken under that Act, for punishment of imprisonment prescribed
for the purpose. Under Section 86, whoever fails to make a declaration
enjoined under sub-section (12) of Section 16 without any reasonable cause, is
liable to punishment of imprisonment prescribed for the purpose. The offences
are proved from the evidence.
Having reached the finding that the appellant has committed the offences under
Section 135 (1) (i) of the Act and Section 85 (1) (a) and 86 of the Gold
(Control) Act, 1968 we think that instead of being committed to jail, the
appellant should be sentenced to pay fine of Rs. 10,000/- and Rs. 5,000/-
respectively for the two aforementioned offences, within 4 months from today.
In default, he shall undergo imprisonment for a period of 2 months and 1
months respectively which are directed to run consecutively.
The appeal is accordingly allowed to the above extent of modification and the
sentences imposed by the High Court stand modified accordingly.
