future probable harm to a specific right or interest. Therefore, such
equitable relief can be granted to a person, provided he can successfully
demonstrate before a Court that his fears in this regard are not unfounded.
40\. While we are convinced that a quia timet relief can be granted in favour
of the appellant, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the instant
case as discussed in detail above, we are also of the opinion that the same
ought not to be in the nature of a relief which, if granted, would, in effect,
allow the present suit itself, at the interlocutory stage. Therefore, although
it may not be open to the plaintiff/appellant to invoke section 60 of the
Copyright Act, 1957, and seek quia timet relief as contemplated under that
provision of law, consequent to filing of the subsequent suit at Delhi High
Court by IPRS, we are nevertheless of the prima facie opinion that in the
facts and circumstances of the instant case, as discussed above, the appellant
is entitled to a quia timet relief in the nature of an injunction restraining
the respondent IPRS from initiating any proceeding against the plaintiff as
well as the added defendants, under Chapter XIII of the Copyright Act, 1957,
until disposal of the present suit. The impugned judgement and order stands
modified accordingly.
