considered it necessary to refer to the judgments cited by learned counsel for
the parties.
23\. For all the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, the plaintiffs have not
been able to make out any case for the grant of an injunction in their favor.
Ex parte injunction, in my opinion, was obtained by the plaintiffs by
concealment of material facts from this Court and the plaintiffs are,
therefore, not entitled to any discretionary relief from this Court.
Consequently the application of the defendants is allowed and the application
of the plaintiffs is, accordingly, dismissed with costs assessed at Rs.
10,000/-. Injunction granted in favor of the plaintiffs stands vacated.
Suit No. 2771/98 By a separate order passed today in Suit No. 2771/98, the
application for injunction and application for vacation of stay have been
decided. Counsel for the petitioner has made an oral prayer for stay of the
order passed today so as to enable him to file an appeal before the Division
Bench of this Court. In view of the fact that the application of the
petitioner has been dismissed on the ground that the petitioner has not come
to the Court with clean hands and had concealed material facts from the Court
so as to take advantage against the respondent, I am not inclined to stay the
order passed today. Matter be now listed before the regular bench on
28.1.2002.
