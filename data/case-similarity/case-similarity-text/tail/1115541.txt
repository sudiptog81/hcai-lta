not that the Commission was not called upon the hold a written examination.
The Rules enabled the Commission to do so. Such a written examination in fact
was held. However, the same was held only for the purpose of short-listing the
candidates and not for any other purpose. It was not a fair exercise of power.
The marks obtained by the candidates in the said written examination should
have been taken into consideration. Evidently, the Commission did not do so.
For the reasons stated hereinbefore, we would direct the State of Madhya
Pradesh therefor to consider the desirability of amending the Rules suitably
so that such charges of favoritism or nepotism by the members of the
constitutional authority in future is not called in question.
We would, at the cost of repetition, would state that although for one reason
or the other, the High Court had not addressed itself on this question, but,
the very fact that such allegations had been made is a sufficient ground for
the State or the Commission to take appropriate steps for amending the Rules
for the said purpose.
In the instant case, however, as all the selected candidates were not
impleaded as parties in the writ petition, no relief can be granted to the
appellant.
The appeal is dismissed with the aforementioned observations and directions.
No costs.
