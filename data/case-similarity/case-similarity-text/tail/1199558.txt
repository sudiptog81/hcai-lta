provides for saving in respect of acts done under prerogative and statutory
powers. It is unnecessary to refer to the other provisions of this Act. Our
only point in mentioning this Act is to indicate that the doctrine of immunity
which has been borrowed in India in dealing with the question of the immunity
of the State in regard to claims made against it for tortious acts committed
by its servants, was really based on the Common Law principle which prevailed
in England; and that principle has now been substantially modified by the
Crown Proceedings Act. In dealing with the present appeal, we have ourselves
been disturbed by the thought that a citizen (1) Halsbury's Laws of England,

whose property was seized by process of law, has to be told when he seeks a
remedy in a court of law on the ground that his property has not been returned
to him, that be can make no claim against the State. That, we think, is not a
very satisfactory position in law. The remedy to cure this position, however,
lies in the bands of the Legislature. The result is, the appeal fails, but in
the circumstances of this case, we direct that the parties should bear their
own costs throughout.
Appeal dismissed.
