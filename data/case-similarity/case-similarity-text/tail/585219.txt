New Delhi, this Court possesses jurisdiction to try the suit.
14\. During the submissions, the counsel for plaintiffs had restricted the
claim to the decree for injunction, in respect of the plaintiffs specified and
future works. This Court is of the opinion that the plaintiffs have
established a case for grant of injunction as regards the existing and
specified titles. However, as far as future works are concerned, the relief
would be based on assumption of future violation by the defendants. No
evidence is forthcoming that the defendants business, or process of carrying
on business is such that there is imminent threat of infringement. In any
case, the plaintiff has not established how injunctions for anticipated
threats to future properties can be granted.
15\. In view of the above discussion, and the fact that the defendant has not
stepped forward to refute the allegations of the plaintiff, deposed by its
witness, the court finds for the plaintiff. Accordingly, the court issues a
permanent injunction against the defendant, its servants, agents,
distributors, etc, restraining them from doing any act, or transmitting
signals or broadcasting, or carrying in its network, any cinematograph film or
work mentioned in the Annexure to the suit, without prior license of the
plaintiff.
16\. The suit is decreed in the above terms. No costs.
