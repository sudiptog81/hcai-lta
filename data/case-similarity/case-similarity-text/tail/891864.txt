the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. This
being the position, exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be
consistent with the scope and ambit of the same in the light of the decisions
aforementioned. In appropriate cases, to prevent judicial process from being
an instrument of oppression or harass-ment in the hands of frustrated or
vindictive litigants, exercise of inherent power is not only desirable but
necessary also, so that the judicial forum of court may not be allowed to be
utilized for any oblique motive. When a person approaches the High Court under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the very issue of process, the High Court on the
facts and circumstances of a case has to exercise the powers with
circumspection as stated above to really serve the purpose and object for
which they are conferred.
Thus having regard to facts and circumstances stated and discussion made
above, the issue of process against appellant nos. 1-6 and 8 is set aside and
the process issued against appellant no. 7 namely, Amrit Lal Desai @ A.B.
Desai for offences under Sections 406 and 120-B is also set aside. However,
the issue of process against him under Section 420 IPC is maintained. The
order of the learned Magistrate and the impugned order are modified to this
extent. Thus, this appeal is partly allowed and stands disposed of in the
above terms.
