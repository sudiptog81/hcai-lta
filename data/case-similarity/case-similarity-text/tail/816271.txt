Backward Classes and subject to the condition of ascertaining as to whether
such reservation was at all required. The view of the High Court is based on
the decision in M. Nagaraj's case (supra) as no exercise was undertaken in
terms of Article 16(4-A) to acquire quantifiable data regarding the inadequacy
of representation of the Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities in
public services. The Rajasthan High Court has rightly quashed the
notifications dated 28.12.2002 and 25.4.2008 issued by the State of Rajasthan
providing for consequential seniority and promotion to the members of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled  50 Tribes communities and the same does not
call for any interference. Accordingly, the claim of Petitioners Suraj Bhan
Meena and Sriram Choradia in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.6385 of 2010
will be subject to the conditions laid down in M. Nagaraj's case (supra) and
is disposed of accordingly. Consequently, Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.
7716, 7717, 7826 and 7838 of 2010, filed by the State of Rajasthan, are also
dismissed.
47\. Having regard to the nature of the facts involved, each party will bear
its own cost.
