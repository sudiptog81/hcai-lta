amended by Notification No. 223/87 dated 22-9-1987 have to be considered. This
para lays down that exemption contained in Notification shall not apply to the
goods where the manufacturer affixed the goods with brand name or trade name
(registered or not) of another person who is not eligible for the exemption
under the notification. Explanation VIII to the Notification has defined brand
name or trade name to mean brand name trade name whether registered or not
that is to say the name or a mark such as symbol, monogram, label etc., which
is used in relation to such goods for the purpose of indicating a connection
in the course of trade between the goods and some person using such name or
mark with or without any indication of the identity of that person. The above
definition has wide scope covering any Logo or symbol or monogram which is
used by another person and in this wide sense, the use of the same Logo P/B by
the appellants when it was also being used by the P&B Laboratories who are
ineligible for the exemption can, therefore, be a valid ground for denying the
exemption to the appellants in terms of para 7 of Notification 175/86. The
Collector's order in this regard is, therefore, up-held. However, having
regard to the circumstances of the case and the duty involved, some relief in
the matter of personal penalty can reasonably be given which is, accordingly,
reduced to Rs. 15 lakh. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms. The
Misc. applications also stand disposed of.
