corporate names of 1st appellant in each of the appeals. What the respondents
were required to establish, which the respondents have established, is a
likelihood of deception or confusion. Same view is expressed in Parker-Knoll
Ltd. (1962 RPC 265) (supra). The North Cheshire & Manchester Brewery Co. Ltd.
(1899 AC 83) (supra) and Saville Perfumery Ld (58 RPC 147) (supra).
19\. An injunction to prevent the use of the word 'Kirloskar' as part of the
corporate names of the 1st appellant in each appeal can be granted even at the
interlocutory stage. Similar view has been taken in the case of British Bata
Shoe Co. Ltd. v. Czechoslovak Bata Co. Ltd. (64 RPC 72) (supra), and in the
case of Sheraton Corporation of America v. Sheraton Motels Ltd. (1964 RPC 202)
(supra) and also by this Court in the case of Poddary Tyres Ltd. v. Bedrock
Sales Corporation Ltd. (supra).
In the result, the order of the learned Judge granting interim injunction is
upheld and each of the appeals of the appellants is dismissed with costs.
The learned counsel for the appellants applies for stay of the operation of
the order.
In the facts and circumstances mentioned in the judgment, the application for
slay is refused.
Issuance of certified copy is expedited.
Order accordingly.
