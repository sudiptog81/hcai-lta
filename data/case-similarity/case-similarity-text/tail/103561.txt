as the registered user of the 341 said trade mark is still pending and when
the Central Government comes to consider that application, it will decide the
matter for itself. After all, the best guardian of the policy of the Central
Government is the Central Government itself and not a private limited company,
namely, Mac Laboratories Private Limited, the First Respondent before us,
which has a vital interest in having the trade mark 'DRISTAN' removed from the
Register.
For the reasons given above, this Appeal must succeed and is allowed and the
judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High court appealed against is
reversed and the order passed by it is set aside. Consequently, Appeal No. 165
of 1968 filed by the Appellant before the Division Bench of the Calcutta High
Court is allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned Single Judge of
that High Court and the order passed by him are reversed and set aside. As a
result Appeal No. 61 of 1965 filed by the First Respondent before the learned
Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court is dismissed with costs and the order
of the Registrar of Trade Marks, Calcutta, dismissing the First Respondent's
Application for Rectification No. CAL-17 with costs is confirmed.
The First Respondent will pay to the Appellant the costs of this Appeal.
    A.P.J.					     Appeal allowed.
