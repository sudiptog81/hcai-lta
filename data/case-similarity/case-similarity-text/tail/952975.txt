the claim and find out whether the prescriptions in the different clauses
individually or cumulatively have any application to the claim of the
appellant for improvements alleged to have been made, if so really made. The
Courts below have noted that the appellant made a claim that he was a lessee
and thereafter made the improvements. The Courts below do not appear to have
considered the issues arising at any rate in respect of the claim for alleged
improvements said to have been from aforesaid angle. As factual adjudication
is necessary as to whether appellant acted in good faith or with bona fide
belief as envisaged, has to be decided taking into consideration the materials
placed before the Court in that regard. It is, therefore, appropriate that the
Trial Court should consider this aspect afresh uninfluenced by any observation
made by it earlier or by the Appellate Courts. We also do not express any
conclusive opinion on the merit of the claim except indicating the parameters
relevant for such consideration. For that limited purpose, the matter is
remitted to the Trial Court which shall make an endeavour to adjudicate the
matter within six months from the date of judgment, after allowing the parties
to place material in support of their respective stands.
The appeal is partly allowed to the extent indicated and in other respects
shall stand dismissed. Costs made easy.
