upon him. He only represented the senior branch of the family and he agreed to
satisfy the demand made upon him by the plaintiffs by agreeing to pay a moiety
of the liability of the joint family at the foot of the deposit. The demand
which was made by the plaintiffs upon Annamalai was thus satisfied and no
further demand upon Annamalai survived after this settlement.
The only demand made by the plaintiffs upon the defendants representing the
junior branch of the family was in October 1942 and thereafter as alleged by
the plaintiffs in their plaint. This allegation of the plaintiffs was however
denied by the defendants and as the matters stood there was really no proof of
any demand having been made by the plaintiffs upon the defendants for payment
of their moiety of the deposit and the suit was filed by the plaintiffs
against the defendants without any such demand having been made.
If that was so the period of limitation had not commenced to run against the
defendants and the suit against them was well within time. With regard to this
contention also there were concurrent findings of fact reached by the Trial
Court as well as the High Court, viz. that no demand was made within the
period prescribed under Article 60. If that was so, the suit was certainly
not" barred by the Law of Limitation. This contention of the appellants also
therefore fails.
12\. In the result the appeal fails and must- stand dismissed with costs.
