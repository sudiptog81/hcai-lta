Explanations added to Section 271(l)(c) in that entirety also indicate the
element of strict Liability on the assessee for concealment or for giving
inaccurate particulars while filing returns. The judgment in Dilip N. Shroff's
case (supra) has also not considered the provisions of Section 276C of the
Income Tax Act. Therefore, in our view, the; judgment in the case of Dilip N.
Shroff v. Jt. CIT (supra) needs consideration by the larger Bench of this
Court particularly when it has ramifications not only regarding provisions of
the Income Tax Act but also with regard to the provisions of Sections 3A and
11 AC of the Central Excise Act and Rule 96ZQ(5) of the Central Excise Rules.
9\. For the aforestated reasons, we direct the Registry to place our order in
this batch of civil appeals before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for
appropriate directions.
10\. Before concluding, we may mention that in the present cases, the assessee
had challenged the vires of Rule 96ZQ(5). By the impugned judgment, the
Gujarat High court has read down the said rule incorporating the mens rea
requirement. It is made clear that if the larger Bench takes a view to say
that the penalty under the said clause is mandatory, then it would still be
open to the assessee to challenge the vires of the said Rule 96ZQ(5) and,
therefore, in that event, the matter has to be kept before the Division Bench
for passing appropriate orders.
