again and our Constitution will be worked by the different organs of the State
amicably, wisely, courageously and in the spirit in which the makers of the
Constitution expected them to act".
I am in whole-hearted agreement with the above observations. On my part, I may
state that I am an optimist who has trust and faith in both these august
units, namely, Legislature and Judiciary. By and large, constitutional
functionaries in this country have admirably performed their functions,
exercised their powers and discharged their duties effectively, efficiently
and sincerely and there is no reason to doubt that in coming years also they
would continue to act in a responsible manner expected of them. I am equally
confident that not only all the constituents of the State will keep themselves
within the domain of their authority and will not encroach, trespass or
overstep the province of other organs but will also act in preserving,
protecting and upholding the faith, confidence and trust reposed in them by
the Founding Fathers of the Constitution and by the people of this great
country by mutual regard, respect and dignity for each other. On the whole,
the situation is satisfactory and I see no reason to be disappointed for
future. With the above observations and pious hope, I dismiss the Writ
Petition as also all transferred cases, however, without any order as to
costs.
