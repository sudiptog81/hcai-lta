to carry on mining activities is a forest land and before grant of lease in
favour of the appellant no approval of the Central Government has been taken.
It is no doubt true that Conservation Act came into force much later than the
grant of mining lease in favour of the appellant, but in view of the general
directions issued by this Court in T.N. Godavaman Thintmulkpad v. Union of
India & Ors. in Writ Petition No. 202 of 1995, the mining activities being a
user of the forest land for non-forest purpose has to be stopped and in case
it is intended to continue the mining activities the same can be done only
after referring the matter to the appropriate authority of the Central
Government and getting the permission of the same. In this view of the matter
the conclusion of the High Court in the impugned judgment so far as violation
of Conservation Act is concerned is unexceptionable, and therefore, the said
conclusion is upheld. Necessarily, therefore, the ultimate direction given by
the High Court remains unaffected notwithstanding the conclusion of the High
Court on the first question with regard to the applicability of the provisions
of the Regulation having been reversed by us. In the premises as aforesaid
this appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances there will be no order as to
costs.
