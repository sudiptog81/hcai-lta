'Concluded by the earlier judgment of the Madras High Court in the passing off
action and already referred to in an early part of the judgment. It is quite
clear that the onus in a passing off action rests on the plaintiff to prove
whether there is likelihood of the defendant's goods being passed off as the
goods of the plaintiff. It was not denied that the general get up of the
appellants' trade mark is different from the general get up of the
respondents' trade mark. That being so, it was held by the Madras High Court
in the passing off action that on the meager material placed on record by the
plaintiffs they had failed to prove that the defendants' goods could be passed
off as the goods of the plaintiffs. The considerations relevant in a passing
off action are somewhat different than they are on an application made for
registration of a mark under the Trade Marks Act and that being so the
decision of the Madras High Court referred to above could not be considered as
relevant on the questions that the Registrar had to decide under the
provisions of the Act.
For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that this appeal must fail
and we accordingly dismiss it with costs. Appeal dismissed.
Agent for the appellants: R. A. Govind.
Agent for the respondents: Rajinder Narain.
