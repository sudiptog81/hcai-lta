the form of a contract note has to be prescribed and the only contract note
that can tie given by the commission agent is the contract note in the
prescribed form.
As against that Mr. Shah contends that there can be no contravention of this
bye-law if no form is prescribed by the association. It is only if the form
was prescribed that the obligation would arise on the part of the commission
agent to give the contract note in the prescribed form. If no form is
prescribed, it is impossible for the commission agent to carry out this bye-
law. We must admit that there is force in Mr. Shah's contention and it may be
that there has been no contravention of this bye-law. It seems to us rather
strange that the association which "was recognised long time ago has not yet
thought fit to prescribe a form as required by bye-law 123.
8\. We think it sufficient to rest the decision of this appeal on the ground
mentioned by the Principal Judge that In any view of the case Bombay Act 64 of
19-17 does not remove the prohibition imposed by the Central law, and also on
the ground that even if it did remove the prohibition, the prohibition has
been re-imposed by Act 52 of 1950 which is a subsequent legislation passed by
Parliament. The result is that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with
costs.
9\. Appeal dismissed.
