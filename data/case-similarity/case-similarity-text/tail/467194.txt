between the product and that Company. The use of the words "A quality product
from ITL group" clearly showed an intention to show a connection between the
product and the ITL group. These words indicated that the quality of the
product was the same as that of a product of ITL group. If use of such words
did not disentitle a party from the benefit of the Notification, we fail to
understand what sort of words would disentitle a party. The decision of the
Tribunal in this case is clearly erroneous and will stand overruled.
In this view of the matter, we set aside the impugned Judgment and restore the
Order passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise dated 19th May, 1999.
However, by this Order, the Commissioner has also imposed penalty in a sum of
Rs. 10,00,000/- under Rule 173Q of the Central Excise Rules. While the
conclusions of the Commissioner that the Respondents were not entitled to the
benefit of the Notification are correct, the fact still remains that the
Tribunal has in a number of matters given an interpretation as understood by
the Respondent. It therefore cannot be said that the Respondents could not
have taken the view they did. It cannot be said that they could never have
concluded that they were entitled to the benefit of the Notification. We
therefore feel that this is a case where penalty should not be imposed. We
therefore delete the imposition of penalty on the Respondents.
The Appeals stand disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
