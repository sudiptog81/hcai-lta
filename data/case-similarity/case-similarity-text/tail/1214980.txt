provided and in light of the aforesaid law enunciated by this Court
hereinabove. The appellants will also be entitled to interest @ six percent
per annum on the compensation amount from the date of dispossession till the
date of payment provided possession of the forest was handed and taken over
formally by the Respondent physically and provided the appellant was totally
deprived of physical possession of the forest. However, we would like to
clarify that in case the physical/actual possession has not been handed over
by the appellants to the State government or has been handed over at some
subsequent date i.e. after the date of vesting, the interest on the
compensation amount would be payable only from the date of actual
handover/physical possession of the property in question and not from the date
of vesting. In terms of the  Page 51 of 52 aforesaid findings, the present
appeal stands disposed of. No costs.
