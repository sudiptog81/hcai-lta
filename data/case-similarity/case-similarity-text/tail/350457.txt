crept into it. They have expressed sincere regret and have tendered unreserved
and unqualified apology for this first lapse of theirs. We would like to
observe that it is not the practice of this Court to issue such rules except
in very grave and serious cases and it is never over-sensitive to public
criticism; but when there is danger of grave mischief being done in the matter
of administration of justice, the animadversion cannot be ignored and viewed
with placid equanimity. In this matter we are of the same opinion as was ex
pressed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in -- 'Andre Paul v. Attorney-
General of Trinidad', AIR 1936 P C 141, where they observed as follows:
"The path of criticism is a public way: the wrong-headed are permitted to err
therein; provided that members of the public abstain from imputing improper
motives to those taking part in the administration of justice and are
genuinely exercising a right of criticism and not acting in malice or
attempting to impair the administration of justice they are immune. Justice is
not a cloistered virtue; she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and
respectful even though out-spoken comments of ordinary men."
In view of the unconditional apology tendered by the respondents and the
undertaking given by them to give wide publicity to their regret, we have
decided to drop further proceedings and we accept the apology and discharge
the rule without any order as to costs.
