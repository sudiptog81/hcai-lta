plaintiff is not expected to split up his suit into two separate suits is one
thing, and the Petitioner's argument here that the plaintiff would have to
somehow maintain its composite action continuing to combine the separate
causes of action of infringement of a registered trademark and passing-off of
goods, on the one hand, and infringement of a registered design used for
manufacture of the product, which bears the impugned mark, on the other, is
quite another. The case of Carlsberg Breweries (supra) cannot be cited to
support the latter proposition.
9 The District Court has rightly allowed the plaintiff to withdraw its suit
with liberty prayed for. The court has also considered the inconvenience
caused to the defendant on account of disposal of the composite suit, with the
prospect of having to face two separate suits, by ordering costs. Besides this
brief inconvenience, which is ordered to be compensated, there is no prejudice
suffered by the defendant by reason of the impugned order.

          10           There is accordingly no merit in the writ petition. The petition
          is dismissed. No order as to costs.
