Court has made, not only because some of the provisions of the Act are still
found to be invalid, bUt also because the present case 729 appears to have
been instituted to test the validity of a controversial measure and to secure
a final decision on it to set at rest the doubts and uncertainties which may
have clouded the minds of a section of the public as to how far the provisions
of the Act conform to law and to the Chapter on Fundamental Rights in the
present Constitution.
