by an order dated 2nd March, 1994. Thereafter, the concerned show cause notice
dated 27th May, 1994 was issued. This has been adjudicated by an order dated
13th November, 1997.
4\. In the case of P & B Pharmaceutical (P) Ltd. v. Collector of Central
Excise reported in Also , the question was whether the extended period of
limitation could be invoked where the Department has earlier issued show cause
notices in respect of the same subject-matter. It has been held that in such
circumstances, it could not be said that there was any wilful suppression or
mis-statement and that therefore, the extended period under Section 11A could
not be invoked.
5\. In our view, the principles laid down in above case fully apply here. As
earlier proceedings in respect of same subject matter were pending
adjudication it could not be said that there was any suppression and the
extended period under Section 11A was not available.
6\. To this extent the impugned judgment requires to be and is set aside.
Ordered accordingly.
7\. It must also be mentioned that as there is no suppression, penalty cannot
be imposed.
8\. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to
costs.
