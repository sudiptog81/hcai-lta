there is a contract to the contrary. Section 17 of the Copyright Act is the
only section that speaks of the first owner of the copyright and under proviso
(b) in a cinematograph film the first owner is the person at whose instance
the film is made. Section 18 of the Act confers the power to make a contract
of assignment but that power can be exercised only when there is an existing
or a future right to be assigned.
33\. In our opinion, therefore, when a composer of lyric or music composes for
the first time for valuable consideration for purposes of a cinematograph
film, the owner of the film at whose instance the composition is made, becomes
the first owner of the copyright in the composition. The composer acquires no
copyright at all either in respect of the film or its sound track which he is
capable of assigning. In these circumstances, assignment, if any, of the
copyright in any future work is of no effect. The composer can claim a
copyright only on the basis of an express agreement reserving his copyright
between him and the owner of the cinematograph film.
34\. In view of the observations we have made in the foregoing paragraph, this
appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above and the tariffs will have to
be modified and/or altered accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
