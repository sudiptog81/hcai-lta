before the High Court.
For all the reasons stated above, we are unable to approve the decision or the
manner of disposal given by the High Court in these cases, which resulted in
grave injustice to the remaining appellants in denying them of their right to
have an adjudication of their claims on merits. The High Court ought to have
condoned the delay as prayed for, keeping in view the pendency of the main
appeals on its file, adopting a liberal and reasonable approach, which would
have facilitated an effective adjudication of the rights of parties on either
side, avoiding summary rejection of the appeals in entirety. The judgment and
decrees passed by the High Court in all these appeals are set aside and
appeals are remitted to the High Court to be restored to their original files
for being disposed of afresh on merits of the claims of both parties and in
accordance with law. These appeals are allowed on the above terms, with no
order as to costs.
The observations, if any, made in this judgment about the respective claims of
parties are merely for the sake of indicating the serious and disputed nature
claims between the parties necessitating an effective adjudication on merits
and not to be construed as any expression of opinion on any such claims which
the High Court shall be at liberty to deal with and dispose of on their own
merits, after hearing both parties, in accordance with law.
