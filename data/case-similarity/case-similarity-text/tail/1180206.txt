merits after affording an opportunity to the complainant to adduce further
evidence in the matter.
2\. A learned Judge of the High Court by a common judgment dated March 9, 1972
accepted this alternative recommendation of the Additional Sessions judge, and
disposed of the Revisions accordingly.
3\. Against those orders of the High Court, Surender Kumar Aggarwal has filed
these appeals by special leave.
4\. Learned Counsel for the appellant submits that subsequent to the High
Court decision under appeals, the Civil Court has, in a suit under Section 55
of the Copyright Act, for rendition of accounts filed by the respondents,
herein against the appellant, held that the respondent had no copy-right. A
copy of that judgment is also sought to be produced.
5\. This is an entirely new plea. In the Courts below the objection taken by
the appellant was that the Magistrates Delhi hid no territorial jurisdiction.
But now the stand taken is that the complaint is foredoomed to failure because
the complainant has DO copyright. We do not think it proper to go into this
new plea. It marks a complete departure from the grounds of appeal adumbrated
in the Special Leave Petition. We therefore dismiss these appeals subject to
the observation that the appellant shall be at liberty to raise this new plea
before the Magistrate.
