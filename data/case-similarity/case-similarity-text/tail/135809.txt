New Delhi May 12, 2000 Before parting with this matter we put it to the
learned counsel for appellant no.1-Jay Prakash Khadria and to learned counsel
for respondent no.1-Shyam Sunder Agarwalla to be good enough to deposit in
fixed deposits in a nationalised bank at Guwahati a net amount of
Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lac only) each in the name of minor Ankur.
Rs.10,00,000/- be deposited in the name of minor Ankur represented by Jay
Prakash Khadria. Another amount of Rs.10,00,000/- be deposited in the name of
minor Ankur represented by Shyam Sunder Agarwalla, each being shown as
guardian of minor for the limited purposes of taking out these fixed deposit
receipts. Learned counsel for the said parties have agreed to this suggestion.
WE direct accordingly. The said amounts, on being deposited as aforesaid,
shall remain deposited and the Fixed Deposit Receipts may be got renewed from
time to time till minor Ankur attains majority. Neither the principal amounts
nor the interest accrued thereon shall be permitted to be withdrawn by the
respective persons who have deposited the same in the name of minor Ankur till
he attains majority. The aforesaid deposits shall be made within eight weeks
