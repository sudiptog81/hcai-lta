India and (iii) an inter-State sale.
(53) Following what we have stated above, we are of the opinion that the
decision of the Bombay High Court in 20th Century Finance Corporation Ltd. Vs.
State of Maharashtra (1989) 75 STC, 217 (under appeal) is erroneous, whereas,
we affirm the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in ITC Classics
Finance & Services vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (1995) 97 STC, 330
(under appeal).
(54) For the aforesaid reasons, all the civil appeals, writ petitions and the
transferred case, excepting civil appeal Nos. 6218-23/95, deserve to be
allowed and civil appeal Nos. 6218- 23/95 deserve to be dismissed.
Consequently, we set aside the judgments under appeal excepting in CA
Nos.6218-23/95. All the civil appeals excepting C.A. Nos.6218-23/95, writ
petitions under Article 32, the transferred case and the writ petitions filed
before the High Court are allowed to the extent what we have held in this
judgment and directions issued hereinafter. Civil appeal Nos. 6218-23/1995 are
dismissed. The relevant assessment orders if impugned in these cases are set
aside. We direct the respondents to assess the appellants and the petitioners
for the relevant years involved in these cases only in accordance with the
principles of law laid down in this judgment. There shall be no order as to
costs.
