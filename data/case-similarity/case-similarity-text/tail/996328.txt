circumstances of the case it is not possible for me to hold that the Public
Prosecutor was actuated by oblique or improper motive.
In view of my finding that the criminal case against Respondent No. 2 and
others was instituted on account of personal or political vendetta at the
instance of some disgrunted political leaders, that no prima facie case of
forgery or misconduct is made out on the materials on the record, that the
Court's jurisdiction in dealing with the application under  s. 311 of the Code
is only to see whether the Public Prosecutor had applied for withdrawal in the
interest of Public Justice, or he has done so actuated by improper or oblique
motive, that a substantial amount of loan has already been realised, that the
continuance of the criminal case in the circumstances of this case will be
only an exercise in futility at the cost of public money and time, that the
trial court as well as the High Court 158 were satisfied with the grounds for
withdrawal taken by the Public Prosecutor, the view taken by the trial court
as well as the High Court in my opinion does not suffer from any infirmity and
is a just and proper one.
For the reasons given above the appeal must fail and it is accordingly
dismissed.
    S.R.					     Appeal allowed.
