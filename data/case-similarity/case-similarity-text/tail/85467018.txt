questions of law, as raised in the second appeal, before the High Court are no
longer needed to be decided in view of the settled law that only the averments
in the plaint can be looked into while deciding the application under Order
VII Rule 11. This aspect has been rightly dealt with by the High Court.
10) In the light of the above discussion and in view of the settled legal
position, as mentioned above, we are of the view that the High Court is fully
justified in confirming the decision of the appellate Court remitting the
matter to the trial Court for consideration of all the issues. In view of the
fact that the suit is pending from 2002, we direct the trial Court to decide
the suit in its entirety considering all the issues, after affording adequate
opportunity to both the parties, and dispose of the same within a period of
six months from the date of receipt of copy of this judgment.
11) Consequently, the civil appeal is dismissed with the above direction. No
order as to costs.
