In Parshotam Lal Dhingra (supra), it is categorically stated that when an
appointment is made for a specific period, unless any disciplinary proceeding
is initiated, a person will be entitled to hold the said post.
The Tribunal and the High Court, therefore, cannot be said to have committed
any error in passing the impugned judgments.
It is true that R. Sundar Raju was not given an opportunity of hearing in
terms of Rule 12 of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Procedure) Rules,
1987 framed under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. But, it does not
appear from the judgment of the High Court that any such point had been taken
before it.. It was open to him to raise a specific question as regard
violation of Rule 12 and denial of an opportunity of hearing but he chose not
to do so.
Furthermore, the questions which were raised before the Central Administrative
Tribunal and the High Court are pure questions of law. They have been gone
into both by the Tribunal and the High Court.
For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any infirmity in the judgment
of the High Court. However, all the authorities concerned must see to it that
the selection process in accordance with law may be completed as expeditiously
as possible. These appeals are dismissed with the aforementioned observations.
No costs.
