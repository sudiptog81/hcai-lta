trade mark, (1886) 31 Ch. D. 454, (involving the present "Milk-Maid" mark) and
distinguished it on the ground that the defendants in this case were not
selling condensed milk in tins or cans having the same size. type and shape as
are the tins used by the plaintiffs in packing their condensed milk; they are
dealing with biscuits and toffees which are not produced by the plaintiffs.
(48) In the above view it is not necessary to go into the further contention
raised as to whether the plaintiffs are entitled to use the word "Milkmaid" in
English separately when the registered trade mark is "Milkmaid Brand".
(49) We have only to reiterate what we have already stated that the question
whether apart from infringement of trade mark and passing off' the plaintiffs
are entitled to any relief on any other footing does not fall to be considered
in this appeal in view of the submission? before the learned single Judge
having been restricted to only two aspects. namely, infringement of trade mark
and passing off.
(50) In the result we hold that the plaintiffs have not made out any prima
facie case for the grant of the injunction sought for by them or for any other
allied relief pending disposal of the suit and that the learned single Judge,
with respect, rightly dismissed the plaintiffs' application for interim
relief. In the result the appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances without
costs. C. M454/72 is also dismissed.
