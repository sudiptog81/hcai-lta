taken by the High Court would partially defeat the object sought to be
achieved by Section 1l5J of the Income-tax Act, 1961. We also do not agree
with the High Court saying that having lifted Section 205 (l)(b) from the
Companies Act into Section 115J of the Income-tax Act, there is no occasion to
refer to the Companies Act, 1956 at all.
For the foregoing reasons, C.A. Nos. 4471 of 1995, 4472 of 1995 and C.A. Nos.
180-181 (NT)/95 filed by (1) M/s Surana Steels Pvt. Ltd., (2) V.V. Trans-
Investment (P) Ltd., Hydrabad and (3) M/s Binjusaria Metal Box Co. Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad, respectively are allowed. The order under appeal passed by the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh is set aside.
C.A. No. 7589 (NT) of 1997 is directed against order dated 31.7.96 passed by
the High Court rejecting the application under Section 256(2) of the Income-
tax Act, 1961 filed by the assessee seeking a reference on similar questions
of law and upholding rejection of similar application under Section 256(1) by
the Tribunal. The High Gourt and the Tribunal both have opined that no
referrable question of law arose. The appeal stands allowed and the questions
sought to be referred by the assessee stand answered in accordance with the
view taken by us hereinabove.
G.A. No. 1663/97, SLP Nos. 12388/97 and 13429/97, all preferred by the
Revenue, are dismissed.
