467 rival of the plaintiffs and as joint owner it is impermissible in law.
Even then. the joint proprietors must use the trade mark jointly for the
benefit of all. It cannot be used in rivalry and in competition with each
other.
42.The plea of quasi-partnership was never urged in the pleading. As
regardscopyright there is no plea of assignment. The High Court had failed to
notethe plea of honest and concurrent user as stated in Section 12(3) of 1958
Act for securing the concurrent registration is not a valid defence for the
infringement of copyright. For all these reasons we are unable to support the
judgments of the High Court under appeal. We reiterate that on the material on
record as is available at present the denial of injunction, once the
infringement of trade mark, copyright and design is established, cannot be
supported. Pending suit, there will be an injunction in favour of the
appellants (the plaintiffs). All the civil appeals will stand allowed. No
cost.
43\. We request the High Court to try the suits with utmost expedition.
44\. We make it clear that whatever we have observed herein will have
absolutely no bearing in the trial of the suits which have to be decided
independently on their respective merits.
