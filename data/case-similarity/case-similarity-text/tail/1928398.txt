21\. In my view violation of the exclusive statutory rights is illegal
activity, to hold otherwise will negate the statutory provisions of the Trade
and Merchandise Marks Act.
22\. Mr. K. R. Gupta also referred in 1969 Delhi Law Times 469 (Wearwell Cycle
Co. (India) Ltd. v. Wearwell Industries, Ludhiana and others) for the
proposition that balance of convenience concept come into operation only where
parties are on equal footings. He says that inasmuch as the plaintiffs are the
owners of the registered mark, and the defendants have no such claim, balance
of convenience is in the plaintiffs favor.
23\. For all the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the injunction
granted by this Court on 10-1-1990 ought to be confirmed, and the application
for vacation of that order filed by the defendants (I.A. No. 2266 of 1990)
needs to be dismissed.
24\. Ordered accordingly.
25\. Before concluding, I must record that the opinion expressed herein is
prima facie, and will not, in any manner affect the ultimate result of the
proceedings after the trial.
26\. I.A. No. 88 of 1990 is allowed and I.A. No. 2266 of 1990 is dismissed.
Suit be listed before the Deputy Registrar on 27-9-1990.
27\. Order accordingly.
