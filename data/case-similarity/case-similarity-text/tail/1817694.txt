judicata, and there is no provision to move after 9 years for transfer of the
kothi. It is significant that all previous orders which have relevance were
suppressed. There is substance in what is submitted.
15\. It is to be noted that suit was filed against Tuljaram. Subsequently
there was a compromise between Tuljaram and Bhagwan Das. It is relevant to
note that Bhagwan's claim was that there was an agreement of sale between
Tuljaram and Bhagwan Das. It is to be further noted that in the counter
affidavit filed by Tuljraram there is no reference to the alleged agreement
with Bhagwan Das. He is a local person and not a displaced person. Therefore,
he has no right to get the property. There is no distinction between original
order and the revisional order. Law is fairly well settled that even if an
order is a nullity same has to be challenged. [See: State of Punjab and Ors.
v. Gurdev Singh (1991(4) SCC 1)].
16\. Above being the position, the High Court was justified in its view and no
interference is called for.  20
17\. Appeal is dismissed accordingly. But there shall be no order as to costs.
