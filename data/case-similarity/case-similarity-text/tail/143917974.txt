18\. Though I have recorded hereinabove the reasons which have prevailed with
me for declining protection under the regime after the coming into force of
the Street Vendors Act but it will have to be considered in the fresh
proceedings if any instituted by the petitioner whether the petitioner is
today entitled to any protection in accordance with the dicta dated 18 th May,
2016 of the Division Bench in Bhola Ram Patel supra or the prevalent laws.

19\. The application is therefore allowed. It is declared that the order dated
25th May, 2011 is no longer in force and does not bind the
applicant/respondent NDMC.
No costs.
