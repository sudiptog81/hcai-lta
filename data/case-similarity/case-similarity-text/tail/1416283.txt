are unconstitutional and are struck down with this specification that the date
mentioned therein will be relevant as being one from which the liberalised
pension scheme becomes operative to all pensioners governed by 1972 Rules
irrespective of the date of retirement. Omitting the unconstitutional part it
is declared that all pensioners governed by the 1972 Rules and Army Pension
Regulations shall be entitled to pension as computed under the liberalised
pension scheme from the specified date, irrespective of the date of
retirement. Arrears of pension prior to the specified date as per fresh
computation is not admissible. Let a writ to that effect be issued. But in the
circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
