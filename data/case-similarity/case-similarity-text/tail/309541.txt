Insurance Corporation (supra). The Division Bench summoned the original files
and verified as to whether proper procedure has been followed in the pattern
of awarding of marks and prepared of the lists. The learned Judges in
paragraph 50 of their judgment observed as under:
".The compilation of records are immediately done, and at every stage, the
senior Judges including the Chief Justice, who were in office, had been
closely monitoring the selection process. The details of marks awarded in the
written and oral examinations were available, as arising from the selection
process. Details of candidates with permissible amount of secrecy and the
marks respectively secured by them were available, under the signature of the
Chief Justice and his companion Judges. The records reveal that principles of
rotation have been borne in mind."
For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the appellants in the
civil appeals and petitioners in the special leave petitions are not entitled
to any of the reliefs prayed for as they have not made out any valid or
sustainable ground. We, therefore, set aside the judgment passed by the
learned single Judge and affirm the judgment passed by the Division Bench
which, in our opinion, does not warrant interference. Accordingly, the civil
appeals and the special leave petitions are dismissed. There shall be no order
as to costs.
