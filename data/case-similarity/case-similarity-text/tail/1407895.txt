the reliefs which were then claimed. It is not impossible that reliefs were
claimed without the necessary averments to justify their grant. From the mere
use of the words `mesne profits' therefore one need not necessarily infer that
the possession of the defendant was alleged to be wrongful. It is also
possible that the expression 'mesne profits' has been used in the present
plaint without a proper appreciation of its significance in law. What matters
is not the characterisation of the particular sum demanded but what in
substance is the ,allegation on which the claim to the sum was based and as
regards the legal relationship on the basis of which that relief was sought.
If is because of these reasons that we consider that a plea based on the
existence of a former pleading cannot be entertained when the pleading on
which it rests has not been produced. We therefore consider that the order of
remand passed by the learned Additional District Judge which was confirmed by
the learned Judge in the High Court was right. The merits of the suit have yet
to be tried and this has been directed by the order of remand which we are
affirming.
The appeal fails and is dismissed. In the circumstances of the case there will
be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
