of their parents, have to be treated as legitimate. They cannot, however,
succeed to the properties of any other relation on the basis of this rule,
which in its operation, is limited to the properties of the parents.
80\. Obviously, appellants 2 to 6 were born prior to the date on which
amendments were introduced in Section 16(1), and consequently they would,
notwithstanding that the marriage between their parents had taken place at a
time when there was a legislation prohibition on the second marriage, be
treated as legitimate, and would, therefore, inherit the properties of their
father, Raman Nair, under Section 16(3) of the Act.
81\. In the result, all the three appeals are allowed. Respondents' suit No.
38 of 1976 for exclusive possession of certain items of property is dismissed.
The other suit, namely, O.S. No 39 of 1976 for partition of half share in the
tenancy land, filed by the respondents against appellant No. 1 alone, is also
dismissed. It will, however, be open to them to seek such relief as may be
available to them under law. O.S. No 99 of 1977 filed by the appellants is
decreed with the finding that the appellant no.1 being widow and appellant no.
2 to 6 being sons of Raman nair, are entitled to their share in the properties
left by him. It is on this basis that the trial court shall now proceed to
complete the proceedings in this suit for partition. Appellants shall be
entitled to their costs.
