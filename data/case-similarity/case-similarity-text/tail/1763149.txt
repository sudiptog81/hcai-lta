of the alleged loan" referred to in paragraph 17 of the proposed amendment by
virtue of which the said words are sought to be introduced in paragraph 18 of
the written statement, rest of the proposed amendment, as aforesaid, are not
such which the trial Court should have refused. However, the trial Court
rightly refused the aforesaid amendment to paragraph 18 of the written
statement.
17\. In the present case, as aforesaid, the trial Court has not given any
reason for acceptance of some of paragraphs of the proposed amendment or for
refusal of other paragraphs. I find, that some of the paragraphs alleged were
identical to those paragraphs which were refused. Thus, the trial Court
exercised its jurisdiction illegally and improperly without giving any reason
and; therefore, the same cannot be sustained.
18\. This revision is partly allowed The impugned order dated 29th January,
1987, passed by the trial Court to the extent it refused amendment to the
remaining paragraphs except proposed amendment to paragraph 18 of the written
statement by virtue of which "the defendants never executed any revival
agreement of the alleged loan" was sought to be introduced is set aside and
the same stands allowed. However, refusal to amend paragraph 18 as aforesaid
was rightly refused. In view of the divided success the parties shall bear
their own costs.
