classified by the Department under CTH 85.24. However, when a laptop is
imported with in-built preloaded operating system recorded on HDD the said
item forms an integral part of the laptop (computer system) and in which case
the Department is right in treating the laptop as one single unit imported by
the respondent. The Department has rightly classified the laptop as a unit
under CTH 84.71, quoted above.
11\. Before concluding it may be pointed out that in none of the decisions
cited on behalf of the respondent, the question raised in the present dispute
was ever raised. Although laptop is similar PC, the former is more compact. It
cannot be assembled as easily as PC. In the present case, the Department has
rightly taken the value of the laptop as a unit and it has given the deduction
for the value of the software. There is no error in the computation,
particularly, when the respondent has refused to give the value of the
software to the adjudicating authority despite being called upon to do so.
12\. For the afore-stated reasons, we are of the view that the imported
laptops were classifiable under CTH 84.71 whereas operating software recorded
on HDD imported as packaged software were classifiable under CTH 85.24 and
accordingly Civil Appeal filed by the Department deserves to be allowed, and
the impugned judgment of the Tribunal is set aside. There will be no order as
to costs.
