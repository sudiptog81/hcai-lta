it was the incentive to set up industries in a conforming area that the
exemption had been granted and the Court held that the Government could
withdrawn an exemption granted by it earlier only if such withdrawal could be
made without offending the rule of promissory estoppel and without depriving
an industry entitled to claim examination for the entire specified period for
which exemption had been promised to it at the time to giving incentive. Both
these cases therefore cannot advance the case of the appellant and are
distinguishable on facts because the exemption notification under Section 25
of the Act which was issued in this case did not hold out any incentive for
setting up of any industry to use PVC resins and on the other hand has been
issued in exercise of the statutory powers, in public interest and
subsequently withdrawn in exercise of the same powers again in public
interest. In our opinion, no justifiable prejudice was cause to the appellants
in the absence of any unequivocal promise by the Government not to act and
review its policy even if the necessity warranted and the "public interest" so
demanded. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of these cases, the appellants
cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel to question the withdrawal
notification issued under Section 25 of the and Act.
28\. As a result of the above discussion, all the appeals fail and are
dismissed. No costs.
