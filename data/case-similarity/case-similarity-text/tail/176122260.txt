respondents had waived their right to question the advertisement or the
methodology adopted by the Board for making selection and the learned Single
Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court committed grave error by
entertaining the grievance made by the respondents.
25\. We are also prima facie of the view that the learned Single Judge
committed an error by holding that despite the non obstante clause contained
in Rule 2 of the General Rules, the Special Rules would govern recruitment to
the post of Physiotherapist. However, we do not consider it necessary to
express any conclusive opinion on this issue and leave the question to be
decided in an appropriate case.
26\. In the result, the appeals are allowed, the impugned orders as also the
one passed by the learned Single Judge are set aside and the writ petition
filed by the private respondents is dismissed. Parties are left to bear their
own costs.
