collusion with officers of the respondent-Port Trust and Government, report
submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), prima facie showing
commission of fraud and initiation of criminal proceedings, etc. if the High
Court was pleased to recall the earlier order by issuing directions to the
authorities to pass an appropriate order afresh in accordance with law, it
cannot be said that there is miscarriage of justice which calls for
interference in exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction of this
Court. We, therefore, hold that this is not a fit case which calls for our
intervention under Article 136 of the Constitution. We, therefore, decline to
do so.
Before parting with the matter, we may state that all the observations made by
us hereinabove have been made only for the purpose of deciding the legality
and validity of the order passed by the High Court. We may clarify that we may
not be understood to have expressed any opinion on merits of the matter one
way or the other. Therefore, as and when the matter will be considered by the
authorities in pursuance of the directions of the High Court, it will be
decided on its own merits without being inhibited by the observations made by
us in this judgment.
For the foregoing reasons, the appeals deserve to be dismissed and are
accordingly dismissed with costs.
