2000 (which is impugned in the present suit) and the third on the extreme
right which is the subject matter of the suit in Calcutta which has been
stayed on the application made by respondent. We are of the opinion that the
packaging of Glucose-D is Glucon-D is so similar that it can easily confuse a
purchaser. We also feel that mere fact that the respondents have time and
again made small changes in their packaging is an attempt to continue to
mislead the purchaser and to make it more difficult for the appellants to
protect their mark, which the record shows has acquired an enviable reputation
in the market which is sought to be exploited by the respondent.
12\. It is true that certain issues have been raised by Mr. Chandra which
necessitate a consideration of the evidence such as the plea based on Godfrey
Philips case (supra) but we are of the opinion that the case of prior user of
the mark is a fact which needs no evidence in the present circumstances.
13\. We accordingly set aside the order of the trial court dated 11th December
2003 and the order of the High Court dated 27th October 2005. However, as this
order is confined only to the limited question of an ad-interim injunction,
any observation made in this order would not bind the trial Judge in the
proceedings in the suit. The application for ad-interim injunction is
accordingly allowed in terms of prayer clause (ii) of the application.
14\. The Civil Appeal is disposed of.
