since P.M. Diesels had pleaded that the FAO(OS)356/2008 Page 19 of 20
Defendant was selling offending goods in Delhi, the Court had perforce to
proceed at the present stage of the lis on the assumption that the averment to
this effect was verily true. Therefore, the Plaint could not have been
returned. This Appeal is also allowed. However, we take note of the statement
pleaded in the Appeal to the effect that before the Learned Single Judge, the
learned Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff/Appellant had "offered that he had
no objection if the present suit along with the pending applications and the
injunction granted by this Hon‟ble Court, is transferred to the Court at
Rajkot and proceedings start at Rajkot from the stage as at present before
this Hon‟ble Court" (paragraph 22). In view of the submission we return the
Plaint along with all the other pleadings to the Plaintiff for filing in the
Courts in Rajkot. Certified copies of the entire Paper-Book be retained and
dispatched to Record Room.
18\. We set aside the impugned Order but there shall be no order as to costs.
