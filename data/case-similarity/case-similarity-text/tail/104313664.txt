Before we part with the case, we must indicate our appreciation of services
rendered by the petitioners and their counsel to the cause, the cooperation
and understanding extended by the mine owners, their counsel, the Members of
the several Committees constituted by the Court but for which these
proceedings could not have come to terminate in the present manner. The
records of the case have become unusually bulky and but for the continued
assistance of Mr. Pramod Dayal, a member of the bar of this Court, it would
indeed have been difficult for us as also parties and their advocates to
handle the matter with ease. Mr. Parmod Dayal deserves our commendation for
the labour he has put in. He was appearing for some of the lessees but the
assisted the Court very willingly as and when called upon. We are of the view
that he should be paid a total sum of Rs.5,000 (Rupees Five Thousand only) for
the services rendered. We direct the Union of India to deposit the said amount
with the Registry of this Court within two weeks from now. This amount when
deposited shall be paid to Mr. Parmod Dayal.
PG NO 735 The writ petitions are disposed of. There would be no order for A
costs. We direct that the reports of the two Committees, as and when received,
shall be placed before this Court for directions.
