plaintiffs that they were owners of the suit property, grant the relief of
injunction in regard to an easementary  19 right by assuming that they had an
easementary right to use the schedule property as a passage.
18\. We accordingly allow these appeals and set aside the judgment and order
of the High Court and restore the judgment of the first appellate court.
Parties to bear respective costs.
19\. The learned counsel for respondents - plaintiffs submitted that the
parties have been litigating for more than quarter of a century over a small
strip; and that without prejudice to their rights, if some arrangement could
be arrived at whereby the plaintiffs are permitted to have at least a `pakka
nala' for passage of effluents from their property, it may put an end to the
dispute between the two neighbours. All that we can observe is that it is
always open to the parties to get any issue or dispute settled by mediation or
by direct negotiations. This observation should not however be construed as
recognition of any right in plaintiffs.
