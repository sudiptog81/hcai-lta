position, Mr. Shah answered that the Court cannot re-write the law. We are
really shocked and surprised with this reply.
11\. When the law says that the Copyright shall cease as soon as an article to
which the design has been applied has been reproduced more than fifty times,
then the logical and intelligible interpretation would be that any article has
been produced for more than fifty times applying the said design. Application
of the design for manufacturing or creating an article would not mean that the
design has been reprinted and has been posted on the body of the machine. The
word, 'application' in the present context would mean that the knowledge has
been derived from the said design and that knowledge has been applied for
manufacturing a particular machine. We cannot have dogmatic approach in the
present matter when the law clearly says that the Copyright shall cease as
soon as any article to which design has been applied has been reproduced more
than fifty times. In the present matter indisputably after applying the design
a machine has been manufactured at last 170 times very year. The logical
conclusion would he that the copyright shall cease to have the effect. The
Board was absolutely justified in directing deletion/cancellation of the said
registration.
12\. The Appeal is dismissed with cost quantified at Rs. 3000 (Rupees three
thousand only).
