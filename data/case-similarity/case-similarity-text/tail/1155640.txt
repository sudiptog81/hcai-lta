It is not suggested that the notification in question was issued by the
Government in respect of a land designated under the master plan, as land
subject to compulsory acquisition by the State Government. On this
interpretation the exception does not become otiose and it fits in squarely
with the scheme of the Act. So, the exception in cl. (3) dealing with deferred
street schemes under  s. 39 of the Act can be made to refer only to such
notification issued by the Government under s. 4 or 6 of the Land Acquisition
Act. I would, therefere, hold that when- ever the Trust seeks to acquire land
for the purpose of the implementation of the scheme for which it was
constituted, it can only acquire land in the manner prescribed by the Act,
that is to say, in accordance with the land acquisition provisions
incorporated in the Act by reference. As in the present case the notifications
issued by the Government under s. 4 of the LandAcquisition Act, 1894, for the
acquisition of the land in question for trust purposes 'do not fall under the
exemption, the said notifications were void. The High Court was right in
quashing the said notificatonsunder Art. 226 of the Constitution.The appeals
fail and are dismissed with costs. By COURT : In accordance with the majority
view the appeals are allowed and the case remitted to the High Court. The
costs will abide the event. One hearing fee in this court.
