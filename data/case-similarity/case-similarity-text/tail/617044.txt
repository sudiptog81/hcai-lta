:
"8. Section 43 of the NDPS Act provides that any officer of any of the
Departments mentioned in Section 42 may seize in any public place or in
transit any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance, etc. in respect of which
he has reason to believe that an offence punishable under the Act has been
committed. He is also authorised to detain and search any person whom he has
reason to believe to have committed an offence punishable under the Act.
Explanation to Section 43 lays down that for the purposes of this section, the
expression "public place" includes any public conveyance, hotel, shop, or
other place intended for use by, or accessible to, the public."
24\. This Court in Union of India v. Major Singh & Ors. [(2006) 9 SCC 170],
whereupon reliance has been placed by thelearned counsel, held : "Turning now
to Section 42(2) of the Act, in this regard, it may be stated that from the
prosecution case and evidence it would be clear that the search and seizure
was made of a public carrier at a public place and 127 bags of poppy straw
(opium) were seized from a public carrier.
The said decision has no application in the instant case.
25\. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the impugned
judgment does not suffer from any legal infirmity. There is no merit in the
appeal. It is dismissed accordingly.
