The allegation made by the appellant Insurance Company, that claimants were
not involved in the accident which they described in the claim petitions,
cannot be brushed aside without further probe into the matter, for, the said
allegation has not been specifically denied by the claimants when they were
called upon to file objections to the applications for recalling of the
awards. Claimants then confined their resistance to the plea that the
application for recall is not legally maintainable. Therefore, we strongly
feel that the claim must be allowed to be resisted, on the ground of fraud now
alleged by the Insurance Company. If we fail to afford to the Insurance
Company an opportunity to substantiate their contentions it might certainly
lead to serious miscarriage of justice.
In the result, we allow these appeals, set aside the impugned orders and quash
the awards passed by the Tribunal in favour of the claimants. We direct the
Tribunal to consider the claims put forth by the claimants afresh after
affording a reasonable opportunity to the appellant Insurance Company to
substantiate their allegations. Opportunity must be afforded to the claimants
also to rebut the allegations.
We make it clear that while disposing of the claims afresh the Tribunal shall
not be trammeled by any of the observations, if any, made by us on the merits
of the allegations.
