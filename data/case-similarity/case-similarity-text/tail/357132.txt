Rangya, Shankar and Kalyan to the appellant to help and protect them, the
confessional statements of the co-accused could also be appropriately taken
into consideration as provided by Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. In a
case of conspiracy in which only circumstantial evidence is forthcoming, when
the board features are proved by trust-worthy evidence connecting all the
links of a complete chain, then on isolated events the confessional statements
of the co-accused lending assurance to the conclusions of the Court can be
considered as relevant material and the principle laid down in the case of
Hari Charan Kurmi 1964 (6) S.R.C. 623 would not vitiate the proceedings. The
fact that some of the prosecution witnesses had been examined earlier Under
Section 164, Cr.P.C. is only a circumstance to be taken into account in
appraising the value of their testimony and the Court has to scrutinise such
evidence a little more closely and see if the other circumstances lend support
to it. The decision of this Court in Rai Bahadur and Ors. v. State of U.P.
Crl. A.No. 121 of 1967 decided on 4-1-1969 does not seem to us to be of much
help to the appellant. On a consideration of the arguments addressed at the
Bar we do not think there is any ground for interference with the order of the
High Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. The appeal thus fails and is
dismissed. The appellant will surrender to his bail bond to serve out the
remaining sentence.
