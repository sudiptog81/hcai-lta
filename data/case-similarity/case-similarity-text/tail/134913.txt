passing off actions alleged against the defendant. Consequently, in our view
even on merits the learned Trial Judge as well as the learned Single Judge
were obviously in error in taking the view that the second suit of the
plaintiff in the present case was barred by Order 2 Rule 2 sub-rule (3), CPC.
Once this conclusion reached the result is obvious. As the learned Single
Judge of the High Court has held on merits in favour of the plaintiff and has
taken the view that the action of the defendants is actionable and amounts to
acts of passing off as the waterproof raincoats manufactured by the first
defendant bearing the trade mark `BACK BACK' are phonetically and visually
similar to those of the plaintiff hearing the trade mark `DUCK BACK', it must
be held that the plaintiff had made put a case for actionable breach of
infringement of plaintiff's trade mark as well as actionable act of passing
off by the defendants of their goods as if they were plaintiff's goods and,
therefore, the plaintiff's suit would be required to be decreed.
In the result the appeal suceeds and is allowed. The judgment and order of
dismissal of the plaintiff's suit as passed by the Trial Court and as
confirmed by the High Court are set aside. Plaintiff's Original Suit No.123 of
1982 in the Court of Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad is ordered to be
decreed as prayed for. Appeal is accordingly allowed with costs all
throughout.
