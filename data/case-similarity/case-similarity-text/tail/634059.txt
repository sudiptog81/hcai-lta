O-L435Sup.Cf/71 582 This relief is discretionary but not arbitrary and
discretion must be exercised in accordance with the sound and reasonable
judicial principles. We are unable to hold that the conduct of the appellants,
which is always an important element for consideration, was such that it
precluded them from obtaining a decree for specific performance.
It is common ground that the plot in dispute has been trans- ferred by the
respondents and therefore the proper form of the decree would be the same as
indicated at page 369 in Lala Durga Prasad & Another v. Lala Deep Chand &
Others(1) viz., "to direct specific performance of the contract between the
vendor and the plaintiff and direct the subsequent transferee to join in the
conveyance so as to pass on the title which resides in him to the plaintiff.
He does not join' in any special covenants made between the plaintiff and his
vendor; all he does is to pass on his title to the plaintiff". We order
accordingly. The decree of the courts below is hereby set aside and the appeal
is allowed with costs in this Court and the High Court.
