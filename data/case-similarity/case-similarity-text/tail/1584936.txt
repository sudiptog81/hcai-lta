Discipline Force holding the rank of Head Constable. The duty assigned to him
was a 'bandobast' duty during the visit of the then President Bill Clinton,
who ran a security risk of the highest grade. His misconduct could have led to
serious security lapse resulting into fatal consequences. But, because of
timely detection of the electrician  PW4, the lens was recovered and
immediately restored. We entirely agree with the inquiry officer that the
charges are serious in nature, being committed by a member of Disciplinary
Force, who deserved stringent punishment. To instill the confidence of the
public in the Establishment, the only appropriate punishment in such cases is
dismissal from service, which has been correctly awarded.
It is stated that the respondent was reinstated on 19.6.04, pursuant to the
order passed by the High Court and has been working since then and pay and
allowances have been paid from 19.6.04. Since, he has been paid for the period
he has worked, the salary and allowances already paid to him shall not be
disturbed. The respondent, however, shall not get his back wags.
In the premises aforestated, we are clearly of the view that the High Court
has committed patent error of law which has resulted in miscarriage of
justice. The order of the High Court is, accordingly, quashed. The appeal is
allowed. Consequently, the writ petition, filed by the respondent stands
dismissed. Parties are asked to bear their own costs.
