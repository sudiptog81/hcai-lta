defendants in the civil appeal filed before this Court and again in the
special leave petition filed subsequent. As rightly pointed out by learned
senior counsel in any section should not be so interpreted that part of it
becomes otiose and meaningless and very often a proviso itself is read as a
substantive provision it has to be given full effect.
It is sad and unfortunate that the Swamijis/Sanyasis/ members of the Sangh
seem to have paid their attention more to litigation than to the propagation
of the teachings of Swami Narayan. This situation should change. If the time,
energy and money spent on litigations and feuding had been spent for carrying
on the wishes of the founder of the institution, things would have reached
very great and amazing heights. We have, therefore, to voice our anxiety in
this matter and request that the system and administration should be fairly
and properly bridled, to prevent recurrence or repetition of feuds, which have
already to some extent shattered the reputation of this great majestic
institution, which has very vast resources and assets. Therefore, it is high
time that proper remedial measures are taken by all concerned.
For the foregoing discussions, we are of the opinion that the appeal deserves
to be dismissed and the appellants are not entitled to any relief. However, we
direct the trial Court to proceed with the trial on priority forthwith and on
day-to-day basis and dispose of the same on merits. No costs.
