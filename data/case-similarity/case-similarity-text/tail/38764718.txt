20\. In view of the above, the order of the Commercial Court at the District
Level is in accordance with law. However, we are unable to agree with the
Commercial Court to transfer such suit to Calcutta High Court. The High Court,
where the cause of action arises has the Jurisdiction to entertain the Suit in
terms of Godrej Sara Lee. Since no part of cause of action has arisen within
the jurisdiction of Kolkata, the suit is liable to be transferred to Madhya
Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench. In fact, the Plaintiff has filed suit at
Indore, Madhya Pradesh only.

same is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh, Indore Bench, who shall decide the suit in accordance with law. The
appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
