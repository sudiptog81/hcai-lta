provided to the Copyright Board against the order of the Registrar under
Sec.72 of the Copyright Act. We mention the character of the order under Sec.
53 to indicate that the effect of an order under of the Copyright Act is not
as portentous as a notification under Sec. 11 of the Customs Act. The
Registrar is nor bound to make an order under Sec. 53 of the Copyright Act so
soon as an application is presented to him by the owner of the Copyright. He
has naturally to consider the context of the mischief sought to be prevented.
He must consider whether the copies would infringe the Copyright if the copies
were made in India. He must consider whether the applicant owns the Copyright
or is the duly authorised agent of the Copyright. He must hear these claiming
to be affected if an order is made and consider any contention that may be put
forward as an excuse for the import. He may consider any other relevant
circumstance. Since all legitimate defences are open and the enquiry is quasi-
judicial, no one can seriously complain.
In the result, the judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and that of the
learned single judge restored. There is no order as to costs. We are grateful
to the learned Attorney General, who appeared at our instance, for the
assistance given by him.
    H.S.K.					     Appeal allowed.
