If the letter of cover is otherwise incompetent to compel delivery of the
policy, then the fact that even by stamping it, that will not secure that
result does not exclude such an instrument and such letters of cover from the
operation of the General Exemption.
29\. This disposes of the main point urged before us in the appeal. This court
therefore holds that this unstamped 'Interim Protection Note' cannot be used
by the plaintiff to make a claim for the loss under Article 47, Schedule 1,
General Exemption of the Indian Stamp Act, and the suit must therefore fail.
It follows that the judgment and decree of the learned trial Judge are set
aside and the appeal is allowed.
30\. We need only make a bare reference to another point which was urged on
behalf of the appellant before us. That point is that the judgment of the
learned trial Judge was in any event erroneous On the ground that he gave a
decree without any proof of the loss or the damage. The quantum of damage was
disputed on the pleadings and no formal admission is recorded in the Court
Minutes. No proof was adduced on the question of quantum.
31\. In the result the appeal is allowed and the suit is dismissed with costs,
both here and below and certified for two counsel.
Bose, J.
32\. I agree.
