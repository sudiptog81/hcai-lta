Department has started the process of calculating the actual amount to be
refunded, the actual refund has not been made as yet. We having quashed the
notification dated 1.3.2001 withdrawing the tax exemption, the appellants
would now be entitled to the refund of the excise amount which has been
deposited by them as per the notification dated 8.7.1999. Under directions
issued by this Court, the Central Excise Department was directed to process
the refund but did not refund the amount to the appellants. Thus, the amount
of excise duty paid by the appellants after 7.5.2001 must have been processed
by the Department but not refunded to the appellants. We instead of directing
the refund of the amount to the appellants the excise duty paid to the
Department after 7.5.2001 till date, we feel that it is in the fitness of
things to direct the Central Excise Department to credit this amount to the
respective accounts of the appellants concerned and the future excise duty/tax
which the appellants may be required to be paid to the Central Government may
be adjusted from this credited amount, so that the appellants as manufacture
of the goods need not pay excise duty on their goods till the entire
credit/outstanding in their respective accounts in this connection gets
exhausted. It is however made clear that from the date of this judgment the
appellants/ petitioners shall be entitled to exemption on excise duty as per
the notification dated 8th July, 1999.
