corner was conceived by the respondent, he could not get it registered as a
new design as envisaged under Section 2(5) of the Act. Some thinking or mental
process has to be gone into while effecting even a small change/variation in
the existing design. When it is said that the design should be original or new
it does does not mean that it should be a copy or an immitation or a variation
of the existing design. It should be something likeinventive. By making the
corners from sharp to round, it cannot be said that some new design has been
created from ane's own mind and thought. 'New'would be something you develop
and which was not earlier in existence. It should be striking new design.
Round corner tiles may look fresh, but I would not say that there is any novel
idea involved in bringing out a tile with roundcorner.
(29) If I apply the law and the principles as enunciated in the judgments
referred to above, the design in question would merely be a trade variant of
the existing design of tiles with sharp corners and mottling effect. Both THE
designs are for all practical purposes the same. It cannot be said that THE
design which has been got registered by the respondent is something new or
original.
(30) I would, therefore, allow the petition and would cancel the designNo.
