the plaintiff to seek withdrawal of the plaint with leave and file a fresh
suit after registration of the firm subject of course to the law of limitation
and subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act. This is so even if the
suit is dismissed for a formal defect. Section 14 of the Limitation Act will
be available inasmuch as the suit has failed because the defect of non-
registra-tion falls within the words "other cause of like nature" in section
14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. See Surajmal Dagduramji Shop v. M/s. Srikishan
Ram Kishan, AIR (1973) Bom. 313.
For all the reasons given above, it is clear that the suit is based on
infringement of statutory rights under the Trade Marks Act. It is also based
upon the common law principle of tort applicable to passing-off actions. The
suit is not for enforcement of any right arising out of a contract entered
into by or on behalf of the unregistered firm with third parties in the course
of the firm's business transactions. The suit is therefore not barred by
section 69(2).
For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed without costs. We
should not be understood as having said anything on the merits of the case for
we have confined ourselves to the allegations in the plaint as we are here
only dealing with an application filed by the appellants under Order 7 Rule 11
CPC.
