present petition, if entertained would amount to nothing but reappreciation of
evidence and interference with findings of facts arrived at by the Labour
Court, which is beyond the scope of judicial review. Law is well settled in
this respect that it is not appropriate for this Court, while exercising
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, to reappreciate evidence
or to interfere with the findings of facts as arrived at by the Labour Court.
The jurisdiction exercised by the writ court under Article 226 is supervisory
and not appellate in nature. Reappraisal of evidence without sufficient reason
in law, to arrive at a finding of fact contrary to those arrived at by the
Subordinate Court, is not the intent of exercising the powers of judicial
review. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the following judgments of
the Supreme Court:
i. Harbans Lal v. Jagmohan Saran ii. B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India iii.
Indian Overseas Bank v. I.O.B. Staff Canteen Workers' Union AIR 2000 SC 1508
iv. Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Asha Ram and Anr. (supra)
17\. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the position of law
as discussed above, this Court finds no illegality, infirmity or perversity in
the impugned award so as to warrant any interference therewith. The writ
petition is therefore dismissed as being devoid of merits. No order as to
costs.
