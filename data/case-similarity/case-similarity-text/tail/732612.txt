activity attendant with such social purposes for appropriate separate
treatment. These of course are matters for legislative concern and wisdom.
Having interpreted the relevant provisions of the Constitution, as stated
above, we feel that it is unneces- sary to take-up each and every writ
petition referred to above to express our opinion on the validity of 356 the
statutory provisions and rules which are questioned before us. The petitioners
concerned are at liberty to approach the authorities under the Sales Tax Act
or the High Court concerned for necessary relief. It is open to them to
question the validity of the statutory provisions and the rules made
thereunder before the High Courts concerned. When such petitions are filed the
High Court will proceed to dispose of the cases in the light of this judgment.
With these observations all the Writ Petitions are disposed of. The Civil
Appeals filed against the orders of the High Courts, however, shall be placed
before the appropriate bench heating tax matters to decide the other questions
raised in them including the validity of any statutory provision or rule in
the light of this judgment. These cases are accordingly disposed of. There is
no order as to costs.
