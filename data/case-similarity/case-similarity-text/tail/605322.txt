of law or of fact, such that she could recover the same in the present
proceeding.
9\. Mr. Dikshitulu, put forward, in the course of the arguments, an
alternative contention that the difference between Rs. 859-11-0 actually
credited to the promissory note and Rs. 568-12-9 should in law be regarded as
moneys had and received by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff. There is
no allegation in the plaint in this regard and the plaintiff cannot be allowed
to raise the point at this late stage.
10\. After the case has been fully argued before us, we felt that the present
revision petition was capable of being decided on the facts and the question
of the apparent conflict between the two views represented by the two
decisions noted by our learned brother in the referring order dots not fall to
be resolved in this petition. Normally, in a revision filed under Section 25
of the Small Cause Courts Act, the courts are reductant to interfere, except
in cases of grave injustice. In this case, there is an obvious misapprehension
of the legal position resulting in the miscarriage of justice and having
regard to the language of Section 25 of the Act, we think it right to
interfere-with the order of the learned District Munsif.. The revision
petition is, therefore, allowed. The-decree of the lower Court is set aside.
There shall be no order as to costs in this revision petition.
