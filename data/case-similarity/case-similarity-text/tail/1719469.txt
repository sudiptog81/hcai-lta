contemplation of Technip when it purchased Stena's shares in Coflexip. There
is no question of allowing any fresh evidence to be adduced at this stage.
Besides we do not think that any evidence of mere contemplation of SEAMEC's
assets would do. That should have been the principal objective in order to
trigger the Regulations as it was not the respondent's case before SAT that
the shareholding of Coflexip in SEAMEC constituted a substantial part of the
assets of Coflexip nor has SAT so found. SEBI had noted that the takeover of
SEAMEC was only an incidental fall out of the control of Coflexip and that
SEAMEC formed a 'small and insignificant portion of the total business of
Coflexip' contributing merely 2% of the total asset base of Coflexip as on
December, 2000. The finding was not reversed by SAT.
We are thus of the opinion that SEBI's order must prevail and the order of SAT
must be set aside. The other issues as to the rate of interest, the adjustment
of dividend and the identification of the shareholders of SEAMEC would arise
only if SAT's order had been upheld. As we are allowing the appeals of both
Technip and IFP it is unnecessary to determine them. Consequent upon our
decision to allow the appeals the bank guarantees furnished by Technip to
secure the difference in amounts between the share prices which would be
payable by Technip had SAT's view prevailed must be and are hereby discharged.
The appeals are for these reasons allowed without costs.
