In that view of the matter, we do not think that the application of scaling
formula to the examinations in question was either arbitrary or illegal. The
selection of the candidates was done in a better way. Moreover, this formula
was adopted by the U.P.P.S.C. after an expert study and in such matters, the
Court cannot sit in judgment and interfere with the same unless it is proved
that it was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power and the selection
itself was done contrary to the rules. Ultimately, the agency conducting the
examination has to consider as to which method should be preferred and adopted
having regard to the myriad situations that may arise before them.
The U.P.P.S.C. has applied the scaling formula and prepared the merit list of
various candidates for the three examinations, namely, the Provincial Civil
Services (Executive Branch), Main Examination, 2001; Provincial Civil Services
(Executive Branch) Preliminary Examination, 2002; and the U.P. Civil Judge
(Jr. Division) Examination.
The Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in interfering with the
merit list prepared by the Commission. Therefore, we set aside the judgment of
the High Court and direct that the merit list prepared by the Commission shall
prevail in the case of all the three examinations referred to above. The
appeals are accordingly allowed. Parties to bear their own costs.
