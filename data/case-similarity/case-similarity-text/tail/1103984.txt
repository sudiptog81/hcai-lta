statute is within the competence of the Legislature which passed 1 its
character is not necessarily changed merely by its rotrospec tive operation so
as to make the said retrospective operation either unreasonable or outside its
'legislative competence.
A similar view has been expressed by this Court in Jaora Sugar Mills (Pvt.)
Ltd. v. The State of Madhva Pradesh & Others(1).
The result is, the writ petition is partly allowed and the pugned orders of
assessment are set aside in so far as they relate to the period between 26th
March, 1962 and the 9th Septemberm, 1964, and we direct the assessing
authorities to levy a proper assessment in the ligght of the judgemnt. The
assement orders in respect of the remaining period are valid and the
petitioner's prayer that they should be sot aside, is rejected. in view of the
fact that the petitioner has succeeded only partially, we direct that parties
should bear their own costs.
Petition allowed in part.
