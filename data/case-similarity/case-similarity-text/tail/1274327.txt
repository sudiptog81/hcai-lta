the respondent and there was no such allegation earlier and, therefore, a
lenient view should be taken by this Court and relief prayed for by both the
parties can be suitably moulded by this Court. We are unable to agree with the
above submission which, in our opinion, has no force. The scope of judicial
review is very limited. Sympathy or generosity as a factor is impermissible.
In our view, loss of confidence is the primary factor and not the amount of
money mis-appropriated. In the instant case, respondent employee is found
guilty of mis- appropriating the Corporation funds. There is nothing wrong in
the Corporation losing confidence or faith in such an employee and awarding
punishment of dismissal. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or
mis-placed sympathy on the part of the judicial forums and interfering
therefor with the quantum of punishment awarded by the disciplinary and
Appellate Authority."
In the view that we have taken, this appeal deserves to be allowed. The
impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 2.8.2002 is, hereby, set
aside. The orders of the Disciplinary Authority and that of the Appellate
Authority are restored. The Writ Petition filed by the respondent stands
dismissed.
The appeal is allowed. In the facts and circumstances of this case, the
parties are asked to bear their own costs.
