process.
We accordingly allow the appeals, set aside the judgment of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court and reject the challenge to the validity of the selections
made by the Haryana Public Service Commission to the Haryana Civil Services
(Executive Branch) and other allied services. But in view of the fact that an
unduly large number of candidates were called for interview and the marks 703
allocated in the viva voce test were excessively high, it is possible that
some of the candidates who might have otherwise come in the select list were
left out of it, perhaps unjustifiably. We would therefore direct that all the
candidates who secured a minimum of 45 per cent marks in the written
examination but who could not find entry in the select list, should be given
one more opportunity of appearing in the competitive examination which would
now have to be held in accordance with the principles laid down in this
Judgment and this opportunity should be given to them, even though they may
have passed the maximum age prescribed by the rules for recruitment to the
Haryana Civil Services (Executive Branch) and other allied services. We would
direct that in the circumstances of the case the fair order of costs would be
that each party should bear and pay his own costs throughout.
