submis- sion that the declaration under section 9(1) was required to be
communicated within five weeks from the date of its making is not specifically
raised in the writ petitions nor was it argued before the High Court. We were,
however, told that the declaration was communicated in the first week of
January 1990, a statement which was not contested on behalf of the
petitioners. In fact the submission was not pursued after this fact was
disclosed. We also see no merit in it. Lastly, it was said that the authority
had failed to take notice of the retraction of the statement recorded under
section 108 of the Customs Act, 1962. In fact there is a specific reference to
the retraction letter dated 12th October, 1989 and the subsequent letter of
19th October, 1989, wherein the detenus stated that they had signed the letter
of 12th October, 1989 without knowing the contents thereof and had in fact not
disowned their earlier statement of 5th October, 1989. It is clear from the
above that this challenge is also without substance.
These were the only contentions urged at the hearing of the special leave
petitions as well as the writ petitions. As we do not see any merit in any of
these contentions we dismiss the special leave petitions as well as the writ
petitions and discharge the rule in each case.
