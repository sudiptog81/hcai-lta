any and every hypothesis put forward by the accused however far-fetched and
fanciful it might be. Nor does it mean that prosecution evidence must be
rejected on the slightest doubt because the law permits rejection if the doubt
is reasonable and not otherwise."
The other aspect of the issue is that the evidence on record, ascribed to be
circumstantial, ought to justify the inferences of the guilt from the
incriminating facts and circumstances which are incompatible with the
innocence of the accused or guilt of any other person. The observations of
this Court in the case of Balwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab ( AIR 1987 SC
350) lends concurrence to the above."
In a more recent decision of this Court in Sudama Pandey & Ors. vs. State of
Bihar [2002 (1) SCC 679] the law as noticed above and to the same effect
stands very felicitously expressed. On the basis of the law and the factual
score as above, in particular the circumstances tabulated hereinbefore, the
issue thus arises as to whether involvement of the accused can be doubted in
any way or the events pointedly point out the guilt of the accused person. The
High Court answered it in the second alternative and upon consideration of the
entire matter we do feel it expedient to record our concurrence with the
reasons and conclusions as put forth in the judgment impugned.
In that view of the matter, this appeal fails and is dismissed.
