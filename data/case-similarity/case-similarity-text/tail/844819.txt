the Act. But the said officer declined to issue the notice of demand. The
question is whether he was bound to issue a notice of demand under section 29
of the Act. Section 29 of the Act reads :
"29. When any tax, penalty or interest is due in consequence of any order
passed under or in pursuance of this act, the Income-tax Officer shall serve
upon the assessee or other person liable to pay such tax, penalty or interest
a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable."
25\. Under this section, if a tax is due in consequence of an order from an
assessee, the Income-tax Officer us under a duty to serve on him a notice of
demand. Pursuant to the directions given by the tribunal the Income-tax
Officer made fresh calculations under the head "Capital gains", and pursuant
to the said calculation, he should have passed an order and issued the Income-
tax Officer did not discharge his duty which he was bound to do under the Act;
with the result he had become amendable to a writ of mandamus directing him to
do what he should have done under the Act.
26\. In the result, the order of the high Court is set aside and we issue a
writ of certiorari quashing the order of the commissioner and a writ of
mandamus directing the Income-tax Officer to pass as order and issue a notice
in accordance with law. The appellant will have his costs throughout.
27\. Appeal allowed.
