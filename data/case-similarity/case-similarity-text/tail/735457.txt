different meanings. In the context in which it has been used it was intended
to connote that the body of the company or its shape did not come up in
consequence of transfer of building, machinery or plant used previously for
business purpose. Use of the negative before word `formed'further strengthens
it. In other words building, machinery or plant used previously in other
business should not result in the undertaking being formed by it. The transfer
to take out the new undertaking out of purview of sub-section (1) must be such
that but for transfer the new undertaking could not have come into being. In
our opinion, on facts found by the tribunal, the part played by taking the
building on lease was not dominant in formation of the company. The High Court
was therefore not justified in answering the question in favour of the
revenue.
The appeals accordingly succeed and are allowed. The order of the High Court
is set aside. The question of law raised by the department in the High Court
is answered against it and it is held that in the facts and circumstances of
the case the assessee was entitled to partial exemption under Section 15C of
the Act. Reference before the High Court shall accordingly stand answered in
favour of the assessee and against the revenue.
The assessee shall be entitled to its costs.
    N.P.V.					    Appeals allowed.
