whether the dismissal was justified. However on coming to the conclusion on
its own appraisal of evidence adduced before it that the dismissal was
justified its approval of the order of dismissal made by the employer in a
defective inquiry would still relate back to the date when the order was made.
The observations in Messrs. Sasa Musa Sugar Company's case (2), on which the
appellant relies apply only to a case where the employer had neither dismissed
the employee nor had come to the conclusion that a case for dismissal had been
made out. In' that case the dismissal of the employee takes effect from the
date of the award and so until then the relation of employer and employee
continues in law and in fact. In the present case an inquiry has been held
which is said to be defective in one respect and dismissal has been ordered.
The (1) [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 719. (2) [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R.
836\. 114 respondent had however to justify the order of dismissal before the
Labour Court in view of the defect in the inquiry. It has succeeded in doing
so and therefore the approval of the Labour Court will relate back to the date
on which the respondent passed the order of dismissal. The contention of the
appellant therefore that dismissal in this case should take effect from the
date from which the Labour Court's award came into operation must fail. There
is no force in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed. In the circumstances we
pass no order as to costs. Appeal dismissed.
