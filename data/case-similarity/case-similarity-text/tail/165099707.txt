as the second question is concerned, I do not think there is any warrant for
reading down Sub-section (9) (a) of Section 16A so as to imply an exception in
favour of disclosure to the Court, and, on the interpretation placed by me on
that provision, T hold that it does not constitute an encroachment on the
constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 and is
accordingly not void. In the circumstances, I allow the appeals and set aside
the judgments of the High Courts impugned in the appeals.
ORDER
600\. By majority--
1\. In view of the Presidential Order dated 27 June 1975 no person has any
locus standi to move any writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court
for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the
legality of an order of detention on the ground that the order is not under or
in compliance with the Act or is illegal or is vitiated by malafides factual
or legal or is based on extraneous considerations;
2\. Section 16A(9) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act is
constitutionally valid;
3\. The appeals are accepted. The judgments are set aside;
4\. The petitions before the High Courts are now to be disposed of in
accordance with the law laid down in these appeals.
