Bhupendra, to be decided according to law and to see whether there has been
any failure of justice due to the order passed by the learned Magistrate, When

provision of law."
11\. The ratio in the aforesaid case fully supports the view I have already

petitioner who himself has moved an application to implead the legal
representatives of the deceased respondent as party respondents in the
petition.
12\. As a result, Crl. M.P. (M) No. 416 of 2001 is allowed and the deceased
respondent. No. 1 is ordered to be substituted by his proposed legal
representatives, namely, Rajinder Kumar and Surinder Kumar whose detailed
particulars are given in para 1 of the application.
13\. Amended memo of parties be filed within two weeks.
