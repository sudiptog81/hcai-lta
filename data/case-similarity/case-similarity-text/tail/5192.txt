The Court in that case held that in exercise of the powers under s. 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the Court cannot issue a commission for seizing
books of account of plaintiff-a purpose for which a commission is not
authorized to be issued by s. 75.
The principle of the case is destructive of the submission of the appellants.
Section 75 empowers the Court to issue a commission for purposes specified
therein: even though it is not so expressly stated that there is no power to
appoint a commissioner for other purposes, a prohibition to that effect is, in
the view of the Court in Padam Sen's case, implicit in s. 76. By parity of
reasoning, if the power to issue injunctions may be exercised, if it is
prescribed by rules in the Orders in Schedule I, it must he deemed to be not
exercisable in any other manner or for purposes other than those set out in O.
39 rr. 1 and 2.
Appeal allowed.
