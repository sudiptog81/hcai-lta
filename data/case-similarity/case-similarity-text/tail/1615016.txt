the class of customers being the same, these factors would result in a very
real danger of confusion and therefore the registration of the appellant's
trade mark was rightly refused.
14\. Applying the aforesaid lest to the facts of the case before us, we hold
the learned trial Judge was right in holding that the word Navaratna, however
spelt, is the most important word in both the names, and the addition of the
word "Kalpa' is not sufficient to override the deceptive resemblance. We think
because of the possibility of the deception, the order by the learned trial
Judge must stand.
15\. That brings us to the final order on the application for the Trads Mark
Register being rectified. We direct that, excepting the registration of the
Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, the word Navaratna in all other trade
marks of the firm, should be cancelled, So also the word "Navaratna". Let the
Trade Marks Register be accordingly rectified.
16\. The result is that the plaintiff firm's appeal and the defendant's appeal
fail, and O.
P. 19/1952 will stand allowed to the extent indicated above. Pandit Sharma is
allowed four months to comply with the direction against him. The costs in the
O. P. are allowed, against the firm advocate's fee being Rs. 100; and the
parties will bear costs of their appeals.
