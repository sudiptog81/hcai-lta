of action has arisen. But this is not really a hardship because such plaintiff
must have had some nexus or connection with the place since some part of the
cause of action had arisen there; if he can have dealings with the corporation
at such a place giving rise to the cause of action, there is no reason why he
should find it disadvantageous or difficult to file a suit at such place.
Equally, the corporation, having a subordinate office at the place, will
suffer no disadvantage. In this view of the matter since in the instant two
cases clause (c) is not attracted to confer jurisdiction on courts at Bombay
and the appellant has admittedly its subor- dinate offices at the respective
places where the goods in these two cases were delivered to it for purpose of
trans- port the courts at Bombay had no jurisdiction at all to entertain the
suits filed by the respondents and the parties could not confer jurisdiction
on the courts at Bombay by an agreement. Accordingly no exception can be taken
to the findings in this behalf recorded by the trial court and the High Court
in these two cases.
In the result, we find no merit in any of these two appeals and they are
accordingly dismissed but in the cir- cumstances of the case the parties shall
bear their own costs.
