9\. Now coming to the facts of this case, the appellant's case is that he
thought bona fide that he need not include the value of the Rapidogens in his
declaration for the reason that the said product was fully exempt from duty
under Notification No. 180/61 dated November 23, 1961. Certain facts are
brought to our notice in support of this plea. It is also brought to our
notice that on the date of filing of his declaration, two High Courts had
taken the view that the goods exempted from duty are not includible within the
definition of "excisable goods" as defined in Clause (d) of Section 2. No
doubt, two other High Courts had taken a contrary view. The appellant's
factory is in the State of Maharashtra and the Bombay High Court had not taken
a view one way or the other. In all the circumstances, the appellant says, he
was under the bona fide impression that he need not mention the value of the
Rapidogens manufactured by him in his declarations.
10\. In the above circumstances and because the facts establish that the
misstatement of facts in the declaration filed by the appellant-or the
suppression of facts therein, as the case may be-cannot be called wilful, the
appeal is allowed. No order as to costs.
11\. Though certain other grounds were raised in the appeal memo, the learned
Counsel for the appellant has chosen not to press them and hence, need not be
dealt with.
