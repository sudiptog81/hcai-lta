subscribe to the proposition that if the Amendment in Article 31C were held
valid, it would have the effect of protecting every possible legislation under
the sun and that would in effect and substance wipe out Articles 14 and 19
from, the Constitution. This is a tall and extreme argument for which I find
no justification in the provisions of the Constitution.
I would therefore declare Section 55 of the Constitution (Forty second
Amendment) Act, 1976 which inserted sub-sections (4) and (5) in Article 368 as
unconstitutional and void on the ground that it damages the basic structure of
the Constitution and goes beyond the amending power of Parliament. But so far
as Section 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 is
concerned. I hold that, on the interpretation placed on the amended Article
31C by me, it does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the
Constitution and is within the amending power of Parliament and I would
therefore declare the amended Article 31C to be constitutional and valid.
I have also given my reasons in this judgment for subscribing to the order
dated 9th May, 1980 made in Waman Rao's case and this judgment ill so far as
it sets out those reasons will be formally pronounced by me when Waman Rao's
case is set down on board for judgment.
