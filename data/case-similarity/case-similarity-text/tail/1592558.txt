for grant of compulsory licence. How far and to what extent appellant has
infringed the right of the respondent is a matter which may be taken into
consideration by the Board. A suit was filed and injunction was granted. Apart
from the fact that the appellant offered to take a license held negotiations
with the respondents in the suit as soon as it came to know that Super
Cassettes is not a member of PPL, it gave an undertaking. Each case must be
considered on its own facts.
However, we do not approve the manner in which the Board has dealt with the
matter. It has refused to examine the witnesses. It took up  89 the matter on
a day for hearing which was fixed for production of witnesses. We, therefore,
are of the opinion that the order of the Board should be set aside and the
matter be remitted to the Board again for the consideration of the matter
afresh on merit.
These appeals are allowed with the aforementioned directions. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, the parties shall pay and bear their own costs.
