completed on or before such date, and includes also all proceedings under this
Act which may be commenced after the date of such order or direction in
respect of any year.
11\. A conjoint reading of the aforementioned provisions makes it evident that
the Director General or Chief CIT or CIT is empowered to transfer any case
from one or more AOs subordinate to him to any other AO. It also deals with
the procedure when the case is transferred from one AO subordinate to a
Director General or Chief CIT or CIT to an AO who is not subordinate to the
same Director General, Chief CIT or CIT. The aforementioned situation and the
definition of expression 'case' in relation to jurisdiction of an AO is quite
understandable but it has got nothing to do with the territorial jurisdiction
of the Tribunal or High Courts merely because Section 127 of the Act dealing
with transfer has been incorporated in the same chapter. Therefore, the
argument raised is completely devoid of substance and we have no hesitation to
reject the same.
12\. In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed by sustaining the
preliminary objection that this Court has no territorial jurisdiction over an
order passed by the AO at Bangalore. Accordingly, these appeals are returned
to the Revenue appellant for their filing before the competent Court of
jurisdiction in accordance with law.
