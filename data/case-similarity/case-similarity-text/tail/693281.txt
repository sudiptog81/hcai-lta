Court was fully justified in interfering with the order of punishment
inflicted upon by the disciplinary authority, which was affirmed by the U.P.
Public Service Tribunal.
4\. In view of the submissions made at the Bar, we have scrutinised the
impugned order of the High Court. A bare perusal of the same makes it crystal
clear that the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226
has re-appreciated the entire evidence, gone into the question of burden of
proof and onus of proof and ultimately did not agree with the conclusion
arrived at by the enquiring officer, which conclusion was upheld by the
disciplinary authority as well as the U.P. Public Service Tribunal. It has
been stated by this Court on a number of occasions that the jurisdiction of
the High Court under Article 226 is a supervisory one and not appellate one,
and as such the Court would not be justified in re-appreciating the evidence
adduced in a disciplinary proceeding to alter the findings of the enquiring
authority. In the aforesaid premises, we have no hesitation to come to the
conclusion that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 226 in
interfering with the findings arrived at by the enquiring authority by re-
appreciation of the evidence adduced before the said enquiring authority. We,
therefore, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and the Writ
Petition filed stands dismissed. This appeal is allowed.
