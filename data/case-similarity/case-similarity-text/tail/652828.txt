goods acts which they were purchasing were those of the plaintiff.
In the light of this discussion, I have no hesitation in holding that the
plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of dishonest passing off by the
defendant of his goods as those of the plaintiff entitling it to grant of
interlocutory injunction.
Accordingly, the defendants, its proprietors, partners, directors, servants,
agents, distributors, franchisees, representatives and assigns are hereby
restrained from using the trade mark JAMES and/or JAMES BOND and/or any other
trade mark deceptively or confusingly similar to the plaintiff's registered
trade mark GEMS or in any other manner infringing the registered trade mark
GEMS of the plaintiffs and using the pillow-packs attached as annexure B to
the plaint or any other packaging whatsoever which is deceptively or
confusingly similar to the pillow-packs of the plaintiffs attached as annexure
A to the plaint.
The defendants, its proprietors, partners, directors, servants, agents,
distributors, franchisees, representatives and assigns are also restrained
from passing off their goods of the plaintiff and from substantially
reproducing any material form the copyright in the artistic work of the
pillow-packs which has been annexed to the plaint.
This application is allowed in the above terms.
