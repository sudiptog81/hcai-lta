the aforementioned order of summary dismissal. We make it clear that we have
not gone into facts and must not be taken to have made any observation in that
behalf. Pending the decision of the appeal by the City Civil Court and for a
period of 10 days thereafter, status quo in respect of the premises concerned
shall be maintained.
65\. We certify that substantial questions of law relating to the
interpretation of the Constitution arise in these petitions and appeal.
65\. Each party to these petitions and appeal shall bear and pay its own
costs.
67\. We make it clear that each of the writ petitioners will be entitled, in
proceedings before the Estate Officer and in appeal therefrom, to contend that
the notices served upon them under Section 4 and the orders passed thereon are
not valid having regard to the interpretation placed by us upon those
provisions.
68\. Upon the application of the petitioners, we stay our order in the writ
petitions and appeal for a period of eight weeks from today. During that
period of eight weeks no action shall be taken either by the respondents or by
their Estate Officers in regard to any eviction proceedings under the Eviction
Act, 1971.
69\. Order accordingly.
