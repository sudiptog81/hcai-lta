that because of these FM stations, it sales of cassettes have gone down, then
it would not be enough that the PPL produces the data about the how many less
cassettes it has been able to sell. The PPL will also have to show how much
loss it has suffered because of fall in sale of cassettes. Similarly, the FM
stations will also have to produce before the Copyright Board their audited
accounts and other materials so that the Copyright Board can arrive at a just
figure. We have been informed that now the audited accounts of the
complainants will be available and that they are willing to produce them
before the Copyright Board.
11\. Taking overall view of the matter therefore, in our opinion, it would be
appropriate to set aside the order of the Copyright Board determining the
amount of compensation and remand the matters back to the Copyright Board for
redetermination of the amount of compensation in terms of the provisions of
Section 31 of the Act and on the basis of the material produced by both the
parties.
12\. In the result, therefore, appeals filed on behalf of the complainants and
the PPL succeed in part. The order of the Copyright Board determining the
amount of compensation and licence fees is set aside. Matters are remitted
back to the Copyright Board for redetermining the amount of
compensation/licence fees.
