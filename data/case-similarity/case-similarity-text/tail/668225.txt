would make it impossible to pass an Act validating a taxing statute. Such Acts
have very often been passed. A validating Act is passed under the legislative
power under which the invalid law had been purported to be passed and it had
been held that where legislative power exists, it could not be said that the
exercise of that power was colourable: Gajapatti Narayan Deo v. State of
Orissa(1). See also M.P. V. Sundararamier & Co. v. The State of Andhra
Pradesh.(2) The last thing to which I wish to refer is the contention that the
Act was bad as it had extraterrestrial operation. It was said that to the
petitioner it applied only because the tea was carried over inland waterways
in Assam for about a mile and a half only. Apparently, the argument is that
this distance is too trivial. But it seems to me beyond question that if the
goods were carried for any distance over the territory of Assam, however short
that distance might be, the Assam Legislature would have full jurisdiction to
impose a tax on such carriage. This point is, therefore, also without any
merit.
Mr. Mazumdar raised certain other points and these have been dealt with by my
brother Gajendragadkar. I do not wish to add anything to what he has said
concerning them. I would, therefore, dismiss the petition. Petition dismissed.
