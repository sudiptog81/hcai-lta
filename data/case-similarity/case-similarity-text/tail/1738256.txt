We, accordingly, reduce the amount payable by the respondent-Corporation to
the appellant as Rs.8,34,103/- instead of Rs.12,05,132.48 awarded by the
Arbitrator.
13\. The arbitrator has not awarded any interest from the due date till the
date of entering upon the reference. The appellant has not challenged the  12
said refusal. The Arbitrator has awarded interest at 11% per annum only
pendent lite, that is from the date of his entering upon the reference up to
the date of the award. The appellant will therefore be entitled to interest at
11% per annum on the award amount from 2.9.1985 till date of award and at the
same rate from the date of award till date of payment.

till date of payment. Parties to bear their respective costs.
