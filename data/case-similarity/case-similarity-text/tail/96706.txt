supplies and services"
"You have thus acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies
and services essential to the community.
3\. There can be no doubt that removing of fish plates from the running track
and disrupting service for a considerable period would affect the maintenance
of supplies and services essential to the community It cannot be said that the
satisfaction of the detaining authority on the basis of this single occurrence
that if the petitioner were to be let at large he would indulge in similar
activities in future and thus act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance
of supplies and services essential to the community was not based on adequate
materials.
4\. We also do not think that there is any merit in the contention of the
counsel for the petitioner that the State Government went wrong in forwarding
the representation to the Advisory Board after rejecting it. In law, the State
Government was bound to consider the representation before forwarding it to
the Advisory Board It may be recalled that the State Government rejected the
representation on 4-4-1973 and the same was forwarded to the Board. And it was
after considering the representation that the Board made the report. We see no
circumstances vitiating the order of detention.
5\. We dismiss the petition.
