demise.
159\. Before we pass final orders, some observations of a general nature
appear to be in order. Hinduism is a tolerant faith. It is that tolerance that
has enabled Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism
and Sikhism to find shelter and support upon this land. We have no doubt that
the moderate Hindu has little taste for the tearing down of the place of
worship of another to replace it with a temple. It is our fervent hope that
that moderate opinion shall find general expression and that communal
brotherhood shall bring to the dispute at Ayodhya an amicable solution long
before the Courts resolve it.
160\. To quote Gandhiji again, "India cannot cease to be one nation because
people belonging to different religions live in it....
In no part of the world are one nationality and one religion synonymous terms,
nor has it ever been so in India.
161\. The Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993, is struck down as
being unconstitutional. The writ petitions impugning the validity of the Act
are allowed. The issues in the suits in the Allahabad High Court withdrawn for
trial to this Court are answered accordingly.
162\. The Presidential Reference is returned respectfully, unanswered. 163.
There shall be no order as to costs.
