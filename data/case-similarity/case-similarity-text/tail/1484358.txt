the witnesses as liars. The Sessions Judge did not realise that the statements
given by the witnesses before the Police are meant to be brief statements and
could not take the place of evidence in the Court. Where the omissions are
vital, they merit consideration, but mere small omissions will not justify a
finding by a court that the witnesses concerned are self-contained (self-
condemned?) liars. We have carefully perused the judgment of the Sessions
Judge and we are unable to agree that the reasons that he has given for
disbelieving the witnesses are good or sound reasons. The High Court was,
therefore, fully justified in reversing the judgment passed by the trial
Court. We are satisfied that this is a case where the judgment of the
Sessions' Judge was manifestly wrong and perverse, and was rightly set aside
by the High Court. It was urged by Mr. Mehta that as other appellants
excepting Matadin and Dulare do not appear to have assaulted the deceased, so
they should be acquitted of the charge under Section 149. We, however, find
that all the appellants were members of the unlawful assembly. Their names
find place in the F.I.R. For these reasons, we are unable to find any ground
to distinguish the case of those appellants from that of Matadin and Dulare.
The argument of the learned Counsel is overruled. The result is that the
appeal fails and accordingly dismissed. The appellants who are on bail, will
now surrender to serve out the remaining portion of their sentence.
