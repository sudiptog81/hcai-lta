bears a close resemblance - close enough for an intending purchaser of the
product of the Defendant to be led to believe that the goods of the Defendant
have associated with them the goodwill and reputation which is associated with
the mark of the Plaintiff.
22\. In these circumstances, the order passed by the Learned Single Judge
cannot be faulted. The Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for the
grant of an order of injunction. The essential requirements in an action for
passing off have been duly established. The balance of convenience lies in
favour of the Plaintiff. The large turn over of the Plaintiff is borne out by
the figures which have been disclosed in the plaint. The Plaintiff has
expended Page 0652 extensive sums of money in advertising and publicity.
Irreparable harm and prejudice is liable to be caused to the business of the
Plaintiff, unless an interlocutory order of injunction were to be passed as
prayed. The goodwill and reputation associated with the Plaintiff's mark,
cultivated as it has been over a period of three decades when the suit was
instituted would be liable to suffer serious damage unless the Defendant was
to be injuncted. The Learned Single Judge was not in error in granting an
interlocutory order of injunction.
23\. We do not find any reason to interfere. The Appeal shall accordingly
stand dismissed. Costs in the suit.
