only one of the many crops in that area and the extent of its cultivation in
Kasaragod Taluk is comparatively lesser than that in the entire area of the
State or even the Madras area. We cannot, therefore, say that the law made an
unjust discrimination between persons belonging to the same class. There is
another aspect which may have a bearing on the question raised. The impugned
section is a temporary provision intended to apply only for one year to tide
over a difficult situation brought about by the reorganization of States. It
is true that every law, whether it is temporary or permanent, cannot infringe
Art. 14 of the Constitution; but in considering the question of reasonableness
of the legislation this circumstance will have some bearing, particularly when
the legislature Selected one of the many methods open to it. Though the method
selected may not be as good as others, we cannot hold that it is unreasonable
and, therefore, liable to be struck down.
