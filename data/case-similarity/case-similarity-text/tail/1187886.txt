information. We make it clear that this Commission can not fetter the
discretion of the CPIO regarding the disclosure of 3rd party information.
Thus, the relief sought is misconceived.
21\. The findings of this Commission can be crystalised as follows:-
(i) The CPIOs are mandated to send a copies of their orders to the 3rd party
u/s 11 (3), from whom objections are sought u/s 11 (1).
(ii) It is not practical to lay down an inflexible rule that PIOs and AAs will
always offer an opportunity of hearing to the parties, let alone to the 3rd
party. They may do so as per their discretion, keeping in view the complexity
of legal and factual issues involved, without forgetting that timelines are to
be adhered to, being the essence of the Act.
(iii) The order passed by the AA is not self-contained and speaking and we
advise him to pass speaking orders in future.
(iv) In view of the averment of Dr Anil Kumar, CPIO of SEBI, extracted above,
the appeal has become infructuous and is dismissed.
Order reserved & pronounced today dated 10th October, 2011.
