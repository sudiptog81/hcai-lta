reached till the award becomes enforceable under s. 17A. In the instant case,
the Tribunal made the ex parte award on December 9, 1976. That award was
published by the Central Government in the Gazette of India dated December 25,
1976. The application for setting aside the ex parte award was filed by
respondent No. 3, acting on behalf of respondents Nos. 5 to 17 on January 19,
1977 i.e., before the expiry of 30 days of its publication and was, therefore,
rightly entertained by the Tribunal. It had jurisdiction to entertain it and
decide it on merits. It was, however, urged that on April 12, 1977 the date on
which the impugned order was passed the Tribunal had in any event become
functus officio. We cannot accede to this argument. The jurisdiction of the
Tribunal had to be seen on the date of the application made to it and not the
date on which it passed the impugned order. There is no finality attached to
an ex parte award because it is always subject to its being set aside on
sufficient cause being shown. The Tribunal had the power to deal with an
application properly made before it for setting aside the ex parte award and
pass suitable orders.
The result, therefore, is that the appeal must fail and is dismissed with
costs throughout.
    V.D.K.					   Appeal dismissed.
