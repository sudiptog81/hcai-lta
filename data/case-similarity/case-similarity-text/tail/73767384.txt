account of using arithmetical mean of the PLI. The DRP had noted that eClerx
was functionally dissimilar, but ignored the same relying on an assumption
that the functional dissimilarity would be subsumed in the profit margin. As
noted, the content of services provided by the Assessee and the entities in
question were not similar. In addition, there were also functional
dissimilarities between the Assessee and the two entities in question. In our
view, these comparability factors could not be ignored by ITA 102/2015 Page 41
of 42 the Tribunal. While using TNMM, the search for comparables may be
broadened by including comparables offering services/products which are not
entirely similar to the controlled transaction/entity. However, this can be
done only if (a) the functions performed by the tested party and the selected
comparable entity are similar including the assets used and the risks assumed;
and (b) the difference in services/products offered has no material bearing on
the profitability.
45\. In view of the aforesaid, the questions of law framed by an order dated
27th February, 2015 are answered in the affirmative and against the Revenue.
The impugned order dated 22nd March, 2013 of the Tribunal and the final
assessment order dated 9th October, 2012 are hereby set aside. The appeal is
allowed.
