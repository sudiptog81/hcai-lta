agreement. As we have already observed there is nothing to show that this
amount of DM 60,000 was relatable only to the approval of the said designs and
drawings.
Be that as it may the value of these drawings which belong to the Indian
company were merely approved by the German company could only be nominal and
under no circumstances the said value could be regarded as DM 60,000. The
nominal value disclosed by the courier, on the facts and circumstances of this
case, could not, therefore, be said to be incorrect. The order passed against
the appellant levying the customs duty and penalty is, therefore, to be set
aside. Ordered accordingly.
Conclusion:
As a result of the aforesaid discussion, Civil Appeal No. 1493 of 2000 of M/s
H & K Rolling Mill Engineers Pvt. Ltd. and Civil Appeal No. 3632 of 2000 of
M/s Videocon VCR Ltd. are allowed and the orders of the Commissioner and
Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal in their cases are set
aside. The other appeals are dismissed but in the case of Leela Ventures, out
of the total contract value, the Commissioner will determine the transaction
value of the drawings, designs, etc. imported through the courier and then
impose the levy thereon. There will be no order as to costs.
