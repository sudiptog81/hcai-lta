26\. In this case, too, a similar result must follow. There is, first of all
the limited phonetic similarity; yet, whether or not 'Palm' is a leading or
central feature is a matter that must await the trial, as must the Plaintiff's
claim on passing off. Consequently, I believe the following order will
sufficiently balance the competing equities:
> (a) The Defendants are not to use the mark 'Palms Hotel', without the words
> 'Royal Palms' (additionally, with or without the words 'Tower and Villas'),
> i.e., not use 'Palms Hotel' either solely or with merely 'Mumbai'.

> Given the size and extent of their business, the Defendants will have six
> months' time for compliance.
> (b) The Defendants will maintain accounts in relation to their hotel
> operations (as distinct from their operations for the Golf Club or other
> activities).
27\. The Notice of Motion is disposed of in these terms, with no order as to
costs.
