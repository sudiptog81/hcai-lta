'HIMALAYA BATISA NO. 777' as the trade mark 'HIMMATWALA HIMALAYA BATISA' has
been registered in their name under the Act. Defendants, however, continued to
infringe the plaintiffs trade mark by marketing their similar products under
the offending trade mark even in the year 2000 and as such the plaintiffs were
constrained to file the present suit for injunction. As it has been observed
above, defendants have themselves admitted that so far their trade mark has
not been registered. The balance of convenience is accordingly in favor of
plaintiffs and in case the rights of the plaintiffs are not protected by an
interim injunction particularly when the defendants are marketing their
products under the offending trade mark, it would cause irreparable injury to
the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of temporary
injunction.
16\. Consequently, the defendants, their servants, agents, dealers,
representatives and all other persons on their behalf are restrained from
carrying on their business of manufacturing and marketing of 'ayurvedic
veterinary medical preparations' under the offending trade mark 'HIMMATWALA
HIMALAYA BATISA' or under any other trade mark identical with and/or
deceptively similar to the plaintiffs reputed trade mark/label 'HIMALAYAN
BATISA' during the pendency of the suit.
17\. The application is accordingly disposed of.
