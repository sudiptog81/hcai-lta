requirement of online marketing entities to seek prior consent of the DSEs
would not deprive the consumer of exercising the choice to buy such products
on online platforms, while ensuring free flow of trade.
136\. As regards irreparable loss and injury, there was no empirical data
placed before the learned Single Judge by the Plaintiffs in support of their
contention that they had suffered huge losses. This again was a matter of
evidence and not inference.
137\. Consequently, the Court is unable to concur with the learned Single
Judge that the three elements for the purposes of grant of interim injunction
have been fulfilled in the present case.
Conclusion
138\. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the impugned judgment of the
learned Single Judge is hereby set aside. The applications seeking interim
injunction in the suits stand dismissed. The appeals are allowed and
applications disposed of in the above terms with costs of Rs. 50,000/- in each
of the appeals, which will be paid by the respective Plaintiffs/Respondents to
the corresponding Appellants within four weeks from today.
