mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following
factors to be considered:
a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label
marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label works.
b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and
hence similar in idea.
c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.
d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the
rival traders.
e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks
they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they
are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.
f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods and
g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of
dissimilarity between the competing marks.
Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depends upon facts of
each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in every case.
The trial court will now decide the suit keeping in view the observations made
in this judgment. No order as to costs.
Appeal is disposed of.
