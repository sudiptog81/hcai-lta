73\. It is true that the more serious the original offence, the less grave
need be the subsequent acts to constitute a revival Cooper v. Cooper (1950)
W.N. 200 (H.L.) and in cases of cruelty, "very slight fresh evidence is needed
to show a resumption of the cruelty, for cruelty of character is bound to show
itself in conduct and behavior, day in and day out, night in and night out".
But the conduct of the respondent after condonation cannot be viewed apart
from the conduct of the appellant after condonation. Condonation is
conditional forgiveness but the grant of such forgiveness does not give to the
condoning spouse a charter to malign the other spouse. If this were so, the
condoned spouse would be required mutely to submit to the cruelty of the other
spouse without relief or remedy. The respondent ought not to have described
the appellant's parents as "wicked" but that perhaps is the only allegation in
the letter Ex. 318 to which exception may be taken. We find ourselves unable
to rely on that solitary circumstance to allow the revival of condoned
cruelty.
74\. We therefore hold that the respondent was guilty of cruelty but the
appellant condoned it and the subsequent conduct of the respondent is not such
as to amount to a revival of the original cause of action. Accordingly, we
dismiss the appeal and direct the appellant to pay the costs of the
respondent.
