43\. Normally there would be a difference between the lending rate and
borrowing rate in each country. Some authors and writers suggest that the
average or mid-point between the two should be taken. However, others like
Klaus Vogel, have suggested that economic purpose and substance of the debt-
claim or debt for which granting of credit calls for the lending rate would be
determinative.
Thus, in case of a capital investment, the borrowing rate will apply, whereas
in case of credit allowed to a customer on sale of goods, the lending rate
would apply. We do not deem it necessary to enter into this controversy and
express our view as regards the same.
44\. We are also not expressing any view on adjustment for lack of security as
this issue does not arise for consideration in terms of the observations of
the DRP.
45\. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the substantial question of law
mentioned above has to be answered against the appellant i.e. ITA No. 233/2014

is accordingly disposed of. There will be no order as to costs.
