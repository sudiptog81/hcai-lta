11\. The counsel for the plaintiffs has thus been unable to clear the doubts
entertained as to the very maintainability of the suit, since the day when the
suit had come up before this Court first.
12\. The suit is thus found to not disclose any cause of action for the
reliefs claimed and is dismissed.
13\. No order as to costs.
Decree sheet be drawn up.
