28 of the Contract Act. The question then is whether it can be construed to
have excluded the jurisdiction of t he Court at Salem. In the clause 'any
dispute arising out of this sale shall be subject to Kaira jurisdiction' ex
fac ie we do not find exclusive words like 'exclusive', 'alone ', 'only' and
the like. Can the maxim 'expressio unius e st exclusio alterius' be applied
under the facts and circu m-
stances of the case? The order of confirmation is of no assistance. The other
general terms and conditions are al so not indicative of exclusion of other
jurisdictions. Und er the facts and circumstances of the case we hold that whi
le connecting factor with Kaira jurisdiction was ensured by fixing the situs
of the contract within Kaira, other juri s-
dictions having connecting factors were not clearly, una m-
biguously and explicitly excluded. That being the positi on it could not be
said that the jurisdiction of the Court at Salem which Court otherwise had
jurisdiction under l aw through connecting factor of delivery of goods there
at w as expressly excluded. We accordingly find no error or infirm i-
ty in the impugned judgment of the High Court. In the result, this appeal
fails and is dismissed. W e, however, leave the parties to bear their own
costs. Y.L. Appeal dismissed.
