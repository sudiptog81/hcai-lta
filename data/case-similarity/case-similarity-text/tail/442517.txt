therefore, the period of limitation would begin to run at every moment of time
during which the wrong name of Bipinbhai continues to remain in the register.
Learned counsel has submitted that in such a situation the principles
enshrined in Section 22of the Limitation Act will apply and the Company
Petition cannot be held to be barred by limitation and the view to the
contrary taken by the High Court is erroneous in law. Since we have held above
that the Company Petition could not be dismissed on a preliminary issue,
namely, as being barred by limitation as the petitioners had not been given
opportunity to lead evidence and the finding of the High Court has been
reversed on that point, we do not consider it appropriate to examine the
aforesaid contention on merits. However, as the High Court has to hear the
Company Petition again, the findings recorded by the High Court on the point
of continuing wrong and condonation of delay are set aside.
28\. The appeal accordingly succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs
throughout. The judgment and order dated 12.3.96 passed by learned Company
Judge and that of the Division Bench dated 10.3.2000 are set aside. The High
Court shall decide the Company Petition afresh in accordance with law.
29\. It is made clear that any observation made in this order is only for the
limited purpose of deciding this appeal and shall not be construed as an
expression of opinion on the merits of the case.
