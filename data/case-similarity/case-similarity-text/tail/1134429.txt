and the Selection Committee constituted by the Commission and headed by the
Member of the Commission, we have to trust their assessment unless it is
actuated with malice or apparent mistake committed by them. It is not in the
case of pick and choose, while selection has been made rationally. The
selection by expert bodies unless actuated with malice or there is apparent
error should not be interfered with. Lastly, the High Court considered the
case of the two candidates who were eliminated by the Selection Committee and
their cases were not sent to the Commission for selection to the I.A.S.cadre.
The High Court found that this was the selection process by the Screening
Committee headed by the Chief Secretary and these persons were not found more
meritorious to be recommended for appointment. This assessment of the
Screening Committee was found by the High Court to be proper and there was
nothing on record to show that the candidates who were short-listed were not
meritorious.
20\. As a result of our above discussion, we find that there is no merit in
these appeals and consequently, the appeals are dismissed. There would be no
order as to costs.
Contempt Petition ) No.131 of 2006:
