an appeal in the Delhi High Court, which was admitted on 1.2.1993 and has
since been registered as C.M.(Main) 414 of 1992. Thereafter, on 4.8.1993, the
appellant filed a rectification petition under Sections 45 and 46 of the Act
for removing the entry relating to the Trade Mark for which Registration
Certificate was granted to the respondents on 30.11.1992. The appellant has
also filed a suit for passing-off (Suit No. 1705 of 1994) in the Delhi High
Court against the respondents in which an order of temporary injunction has
been granted in favour of the appellant which has been upheld by the Division
Bench of the High Court as also by this Court. In that suit, an amendment
application has also been filed so as to include the ground of infringement of
the appellant's Trade Mark but that application has not yet been disposed of.
It is, however, obvious that if the application is allowed, the amendments
will relate back to the date of the application, if not to the date of plaint.
In view of the pendency of these proceedings in the High Court and specially
in view of Section 107 of the Act, the Registrar could not legally issue any
suo motu notice to the appellant under Section 56(4) of the Act for
cancellation of the Certificate of Registration/Renewal already granted. The
appeal is consequently allowed and the show-cause notice issued by the Deputy
Registrar (respondent No.2) on 26th of Sept. 1997 under Section 56(4) of the
Act is hereby quashed. The appellants shall be entitled to their costs.
