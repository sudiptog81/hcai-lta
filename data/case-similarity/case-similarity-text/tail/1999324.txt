Selection Committee to meet during a particular year would not dispense with
the requirement of preparing the Select List for that year. If for any reason
the Selection Committee is not able to meet during a particular year, the
Committee when it meets next, should, while making the selection, prepare a
separate list for each year keeping in view the number of vacancies in that
year after considering the State Civil Service Officers who were eligible and
fell within the zone of consideration for selection in that year."
It cannot thus be treated to be void but any irregularity which is of curable
nature and can be cured. Dr. Dhawan made some comments as regards the
situation in Uttar Pradesh in support of not having annual selections and thus
clubbing. We are not, however, inclined to dilate thereon neither any credence
can be put thereto by reason of our views expressed above. Clubbing in a later
year may not be treated as fatal but as noticed earlier, curable, more so
having regard to the fact that initiation of a selection process throughout
the State would further take a considerable period of time and the Court's
attitude presently being pragmatic and justice oriented should do away with
techincalities ought not to out-weigh the course of justice.
In that view of the matter, the order impugned cannot be sustained. The
judgment of the learned Single Judge as also that of the Division Bench stand
set aside. The appeals thus stand allowed. No costs.
