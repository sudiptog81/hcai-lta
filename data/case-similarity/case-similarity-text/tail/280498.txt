the amendment brought by the Parliament is by way of ex abundanti cautela.
75\. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we proceed to enumerate our
conclusions in seriatim as follows:
(a) The provisions, namely, Section 65(105)(zzzz) and Section 66 of the
Finance Act, 1994 and as amended by the Finance Act, 2010, are intra vires the
Constitution of India.
(b) The decision rendered in the first Home Solution case does not lay down
the correct law as we have held that there is value addition when the premises
is let out for use in the course of or WP(C) No.3398/2010 with connected
matters Page 99 of 100 furtherance of business or commerce and it is,
accordingly overruled.
(c) The challenge to the amendment giving it retrospective effect is
unsustainable and, accordingly, the same stands repelled and the retrospective
amendment is declared as constitutionally valid.
76\. Consequently, the writ petitions, being sans substratum, stand dismissed
without any order as to costs.
