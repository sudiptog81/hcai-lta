this stage.
We do not intend to delve deep into the questions as to whether the two ships
named hereinabove are the sister ships of the respondent No. 1 Vessel or
whether the requirement of law as regard ownership of a ship in the Respondent
No. 1 as beneficial owner has been fulfilled or not. Such issues must be
considered at an appropriate stage.
CONCLUSION :
We, therefore, direct that in the event, a proper application is filed either
for dissolution of the interim order of injunction passed by the learned
Single Judge or if the High Court in its wisdom thinks fit to decide any issue
as a preliminary issue such questions may be gone into in greater details. Any
observations made by us must be considered to have been made only for the
purpose of disposal of these appeals and not for the purpose of determining
the merit of the matter. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances
of this case, we will request the High Court to consider the desirability of
disposing of the matter as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a
period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
For the reasons aforementioned, the judgment under challenge is set aside and
the matter is sent back to the High Court. Civil Appeal No. 5665 of 2002 is
accordingly allowed and Civil Appeal No. 5666 of 2002 is dismissed. No costs.
