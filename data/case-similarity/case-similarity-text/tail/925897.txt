(i) the subject matter of the dispute is non capable of settlement by
arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or
(ii) the arbitral amount is in conflict with the public policy in India.
The Explanation to the provisions says that without prejudice to the
generality of sub-clause (ii) of clause (b), it is declared for the avoidance
of any doubt, that an award is to be treated as in conflict with the public
policy of India if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud,
or corruption or was in violation of sections 75 or 81. Section 75 deals with
confidentiality while section 81 deals with admissibility of evidence in other
proceedings. We do not have any such situation before us falling within
section 34(2)(b)(ii). The factual points raised in the case before us, to
which we have referred to earlier, do not fall within Section 34(2)(b)(ii).
Coming to Section 34(2)(b)(i) we have already held that the subject matter of
the dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration under the law for
the time being in force. Nor is any point raised that the arbitral award is in
conflict with the public policy of India. We are, therefore, of the view that
the merits of the award, on the facts of the case do not fall under Section
34(2)(b) of the Act. Point 4 is held accordingly against the appellant.
For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals fail and are dismissed but in the
circumstances without costs.
