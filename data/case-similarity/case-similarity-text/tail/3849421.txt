after thoroughly scrutinizing the same any finding can be given of existence
or non-existence of prior publication.
25\. So far as the merits of the present case of existence of prior
publication in the facts of the present case are concerned, we find that
Division Bench has approved the decision of the learned Single Judge of
existence of prior publication in the facts of the present case because the
spatula in question was found in actual use prior to registration in India,
and with respect to which the relevant observations are made by the Division
Bench in paras 12 and 15 of the judgment/reference order of the Division Bench
dated 8.10.2010. We may, of course, hasten to add that any FAO (OS)
No.458/2009 Page 66 of 67 observations made in an interim order are always
prima facie in nature and are made only for the purpose of disposing of an
interim injunction, and the issue of prior publication in the facts of the
present case will be finally decided uninfluenced by any observations qua the
factual aspects made at the interim stage as to existence of the spatula
abroad after evidence is led by both the parties in this case.
26\. Let the parties appear before the learned Single Judge on 17th April,
2013 for further proceedings in the suit.
