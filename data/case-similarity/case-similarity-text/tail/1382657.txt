case under section 43 of the Act of 1882 (corresponding to Order II, Rule 2)
where plaintiff made various claim in the same. "
In the instant case the High Court has not dealt with the question as to
whether it had jurisdiction to deal with the writ petition. It only observed
that the Delhi High Court may have jurisdiction, but the issues relating to
conditions of prisoners in the State of U.P. can be more effectively dealt
with by the Allahabad High Court. As noted supra, there were two grievances by
the appellant. But only one of them i.e. the alleged lack of medical
facilities has been referred to by the High Court. It was open to the Delhi
High Court to say that no part of the cause of action arose within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court. The High Court in the
impugned order does not say so. On the contrary, it says that jurisdiction may
be there, but the Allahabad High Court can deal with the matter more
effectively. That is not certainly a correct way to deal with the writ
petition. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and
remit the matter to it for fresh hearing on merits. A prayer has been made for
release of the appellant on parole for the reasons indicated in the
application. We are not inclined to pass any order on the said application.
The same is rejected.
The appeal is disposed of as aforesaid. No costs.
