that article the Government reserved to itself the right to order the recovery
from the pension and compassionate allowances of a Government servant of any
amount on account of losses found in judicial or departmental proceedings to
have been caused to Government by the negligence or fraud of such officer
during his service. There is a proviso to this article which says that
departmental proceedings, if not instituted while the officer was on duty,
shall not be instituted except under certain circumstances, which we need not
detail here. The appellant says that the departmental proceedings that look
place against him should have been instituted in the manner provided in this
proviso. There is no force in this contention because the proviso only comes
into force when the departmental proceedings take place after the officer has
given up service. It does not apply to a case like the present where the
departmental proceedings took place while the appellant was still in
service.Before we leave this case, we may point out that the appellant
contended that the Fundamental Rules of the Government of India applied to
him. This again in wrong for what apply to him are the regulations and not the
Fundamental Rules of the Government of India.
We are therefore of opinion that there is no force in this appeal. It is
hereby dismissed. In the circumstances of the case we pass no order as to
costs and court-fee.
