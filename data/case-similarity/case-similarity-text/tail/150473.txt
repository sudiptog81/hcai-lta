receiving written statements, after the expiry of the period permitted by law,
in a routine manner.
6\. A dispensation that makes Order VIII Rule 1 directory, leaving it to the
courts to extend the time indiscriminately would tend to defeat the object
sought to be achieved by the amendments to the Code. It is, therefore,
necessary to emphasize that the grant of extension of time beyond 30 days is
not automatic, that it should be exercised with caution and for adequate
reasons and that an extension of time beyond 90 days of the service of summons
must be granted only based on a clear satisfaction of the justification for
granting such extension, the court being conscious of the fact that even the
power of the court for extension inhering in Section 148 of the Code, has also
been restricted by the legislature. It would be proper to encourage the belief
in litigants that the imperative of Order VIII Rule 1 must be adhered to and
that only in rare and exceptional cases, the breach thereof will be condoned.
Such an approach by courts alone can carry forward the legislative intent of
avoiding delays or at least in curtailing the delays in the disposal of suits
filed in courts. The lament of Lord Denning in ALLEN vs. SIR ALFRED McALPINE &
SONS [(1968) 1 All E.R. 543] that law's delays have been intolerable and last
so long as to turn justice sour, is true of our legal system as well. Should
that state of affairs continue for all times?
