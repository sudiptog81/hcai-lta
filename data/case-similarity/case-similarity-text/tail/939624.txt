Civil Appeal in the case of Ahmedabad Electricity Company ( C.A.No.
2168-69/2001) which is arising from proceedings before the High Court under
Article 226. The remaining matters in the bunch are statutory appeals under
Section 35L of Central Excise Act. Therefore, this court has to go into the
matter on merits. Moreover, in the Ahmedabad Electricity Company's case
challenge by way of Writ Petition under Article 226 was to a Circular dated
7th April, 1998 issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the
consequential Trade Notice No.36/98 dated 22nd May, 1998 issued by the office
of the Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs, Ahmedabad by which it was
clarified that "coal- ash (cinder)" is an excisable commodity classifiable
under sub- heading No. 26.21 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. In the
first place no objection regarding maintainability of the Writ Petition seems
to have been taken before the High Court. Even if such an objection was
raised, the same would have been a futile attempt. In the facts of the case
the High Court would have been justified in rejecting such an objection. The
impugned circular could not have been challenged before the departmental
authorities as they would have felt bound by it. We find no merit in the
objection. The same is rejected.
All the appeals filed by the Revenue stand dismissed with no order as to
costs.
