being rendered nugatory. A certain apprehension may legitimately arise in the
minds of the authorities administering the Act that if the Appellate Tribunals
proceed to stay recovery of taxes or penalties payable by or imposed on the
assessees as a matter of course the revenue will be put to great loss because
of the inordinate delay in the disposal of appeals by the Appellate Tribunals.
It is needless to point out that the power of stay by the Tribunal is not
likely to be exercised in a routine way or as a matter of course in view of
the special nature of taxation and revenue. laws. It wilt only be when' a
strong prima facie case is made out that the Tribunal will consider whether to
stay the recovery proceedings and on what conditions and the stay will be
granted in most deserving and appropriate cases where the Tribunal is
satisfied that the entire purpose of the appeal will be frustrated or rendered
nugatory by allowing the recovery proceedings to continue during the pendency
of the appeal.
For all the reasons given above, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed.
But in view of the entire circumstances the parties are left to bear their own
costs.
    V.P.S.						      Appeal
    dismissed.
