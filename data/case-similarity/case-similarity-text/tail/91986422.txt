selling a tablet at a lower price than that of plaintiffs cannot be made
ground to decline injunction against the defendant, who has been found to have
been infringing the invention of the plaintiffs, is as much as, a competitor
of the plaintiffs.

108\. In view of the findings returned on the above referred issues defendant
is restrained by a decree of permanent injunction from making, using, selling,
distributing, advertising, exporting, offering for sale or dealing in
Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate or any other salt of Sitagliptin in any
form, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs thereby infringing
the suit patent no. 209816 of the plaintiffs. As regards damages are
concerned, no issue has been framed in this regard, inasmuch as, only on the
basis of the admission by DW1 regarding total sales and the percentage of the
profits earned by the defendant, I do not find it justifiable to quantify the
amount of damages. Plaintiffs shall, however, be entitled to actual costs of
the proceedings. Decree sheet be drawn.
