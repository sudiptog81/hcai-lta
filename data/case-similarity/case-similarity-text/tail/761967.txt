of fact arising for determination in that case but only for showing the nature
of the right declared under Art. 19(1)(f) and the effect in law of a statute
contravening it. Das, J., as he then was, in his dissenting judgment, did not
state his view on this question but expressly reserved it in the following
words:-
" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large measure found
myself in agreement with the views of Venkatarama Aiyar, J., on that part of
the case. I, however, desire to guard myself against being understood to agree
with the rest of the observations to be found in his judgment, particularly
those relating to waiver of 'unconstitutionality, the fundamental rights being
a mere check on the legislative power or the effect of the declaration under
Art. 13(1) being relatively void'. On those topics prefer to express no
opinion on this occasion." I respectfully agree with the observations of
Mahajan, C. J. For the aforesaid reasons, hold that the doctrine of waiver has
no application in the case of fundamental rights under our Constitution.
