framing charge, the court has to prima facie consider whether there is
sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The court is not
required to appreciate evidence to conclude whether the materials produced are
sufficient or not for convicting the accused.
The judgments relied by the Ld.Defence Counsel are not on point of charge.
There are specific allegations against the accused qua "cruelty" committed
upon the complainant to come under the purview of Section 498A IPC. There are
also specific allegations FIR No.577/03 State V. Charanjeet Singh @ Vicky Page
No 8 of 9 against the accused for commission of offence U/s 420 IPC.
But there are only bald allegations against the accused for commission of
offence U/s 494 IPC as there is not sufficient material on record for the
same. Hence, the accused Charanjeet is discharged for commission of offence
U/s 494 IPC.
In view of aforesaid discussion, this Court is of the considered opinion that
prima facie, there is a sufficient material to frame charge U/s 498A/420 IPC
against the accused Charanjeet Singh (being the husband).
Be put up for framing of charge on 25.06.2015. Announced and dictated in the
open Court today i.e. on 05.03.2015 (Shefali Barnala Tandon) MM, Mahila Court,
