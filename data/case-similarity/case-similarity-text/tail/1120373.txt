identi- fy the others does not alter the situation. We are, on the other hand,
convinced from the evidence of PW 1 Komal Chand that some of the co-accused,
particularly, Gunda, Parsu and Gopal had participated in the commission of the
crime. It is another matter that in the absence of a State appeal the High
Court could not, nor can we, interfere with their acquittal, but as
rightly'pointed in Brathi's case this Court is not bound by the facts found
proved on the appreci- ation of evidence by the courts below and is, in law,
enti- tled to reach its own conclusion different from the one recorded by the
court's below on a review of the evidence. In that view of the matter we think
that the conviction of the appellant can be sustained with the aid of section
34 or 149, IPC, as the case may be. In the present case we feel it safe to
confirm the conviction of the appellant with the aid of section 34, IPC. We,
therefore, cannot agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the
appellant that at best the conviction can be recorded under section 324, IPC.
We confirm the conviction of the appellant under section 302, IPC, with the
aid of section 34 and maintain the sen- tence awarded to him.
For the above reasons we see no merit in this appeal and dismiss the same.
