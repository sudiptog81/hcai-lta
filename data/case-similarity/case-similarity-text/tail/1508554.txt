the question of appropriate punishment in service matters relating to
Government employees or employees of the public corporations. I have said so
because if need for maintenance of office discipline be the reason of our
adopting a strict attitude qua the public servants, discipline has to be
maintained in the industrial sector also. The availability of appeal etc. to
public servants does not make a real difference, as the appellate/revisional
authority is known to have taken a different view on the question of sentence
only rarely. I would, therefore, think that but for the self-imposed
limitation while exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution, there
is no inherent reason to disallow application of judicial mind to the question
of proportionately of punishment/penalty. But then, while seized with this
question as a writ court interference is permissible only when the
punishment/penalty is shockingly disproportionate.
6\. I had expressed my unhappiness qua the first facet of the case, as Chief
Justice of the Orissa High Court in paras 20 and 21 of Krishna Chandra v.
Union of India, AIR 1992 Orissa 261 (FB), by asking why the power of doing
complete justice has been denied to the High Courts ? I feel happy that I have
been able to state, as a Judge of the Apex Court, that the High Courts too are
to do complete justice. This is also the result of what has been held in the
leading judgment.
