enforced does not arise from a contract to which the unregistered firm is a
party, or is not entered into in connection with the business of the
unregistered firm with a third party, the bar of Section 69(2) will not apply.
In the instant case the contract was entered into with the respondent firm by
the erstwhile proprietor of the concern namely Purushottam. The partnership
firm came into existence later. The amount claimed in the suit were due to the
proprietor Purushottam who carried on his proprietary business in the name and
style of "Dinesh Paper Mart". When he entered into partnership with others, he
contributed to the partnership by way of his contribution to the capital, all
the assets and liabilities of his erstwhile proprietary concern. Thus, though
the partnership firm, which was unregistered, became entitled to enforce the
contractual obligation of the defendant firm which it owed to Purushottam, the
contract was not one entered into by the unregistered firm with a third party,
nor was it one entered into by the unregistered firm in the course of its
business dealings with the defendants. So viewed, the bar of Section 69(2)
cannot apply to the suit filed by the Plaintiff  appellants.
We, therefore, allow this appeal with costs and set aside the impugned
judgment and decree of the High Court and restore that of the Third Joint
Civil Judge (Senior Division) Nagpur, in Civil Suit No.52 of 1980 dated
29.4.1987.
