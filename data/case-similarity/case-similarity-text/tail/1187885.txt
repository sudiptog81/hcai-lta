to recover the so-called difference in valuation of the imported goods from
the ultimate bona fide purchaser for value. If the Collector failed to make a
proper enquiry as to the market value of the goods and released the same after
a half-hearted adjudication, we fail to see why a subsequent purchaser be
saddled with the liability of under- valuation; more so in the background of
the fact that the appellant had no role to play either in the import or
earlier adjudication proceedings. That apart, it is rather surprising that the
fresh proceeding under Section 111(m) is not initiated against the original
importer inspite of the provisions of Section 28 of the Act. Counsel for the
respondent is unable to convince us why no notice under Section 124 is issued
against the original importer who was permitted by the Department to redeem
the goods under Section 125 of the Act and sell the same in the open market.
In this background, we are of the opinion that the action of the Department to
initiate proceedings against the appellant, who is a bona fide purchaser of
the redeemed goods for value, is unjust and hence not sustainable in the facts
and circumstances of this case. For the reasons stated above, we are of the
opinion that the initiation of proceedings under Section 111(m) of the Act is
liable to be quashed. Consequently, we allow these appeals, quash the orders
impugned herein and the fine and duty, if any, collected from the appellant
for redemption of the goods is directed to be refunded. No costs.
