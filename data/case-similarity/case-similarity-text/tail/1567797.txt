injustice or that the balance of convenience is decided by or overwhelmingly
against the suit going on in the forum chosen by the plaintiff.
It is asserted now before us on behalf of this respondent-plaintiff that the
entire evidence regarding the subject-matter of the suit would be available
only in Madras, for the main ground on which the suit has been filed is that
the second defendant, who was the chairman of the plaintiff-company at the
relevant time misused his position as chairman of the company and the trust
reposed in him at such chairman and induced the proposed fourth defendant and
the first defendant to terminate the agency of the plaintiff and give it to
the third defendant company which was formed by the second defendant. Further,
in the case now before us there are no circumstances which would show that the
plaintiff has chosen this forum mala fide, nor can it be said that the forum
chosen is such that if the Court permits the suit to go on, the other party
would be so handicapped in his defence that it would lead to injustice or that
the balance of convenience is decidedly or overwhelmingly against a suit going
on in the forum chosen by the plaintiff.
25\. We therefore find that Padmanabhan, J. was right in having refused to
revoke the leave which he had granted under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent to
sue the proposed fourth defendant. This appeal is therefore dismissed with
costs.
