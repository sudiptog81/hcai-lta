right. By adopting the latter course indicated by us, the defendants first set
would have got a fair and adequate opportunity of scrutinizing the accounts
and showing whether they were tained with fraud, mistake, inaccuracy or
omission or of showing that any item claimed by the plaintiff was in fact not
due to him.
33\. Question No. 7 :-The High Court has for cogent reasons held that the
goods on which the burden of charge lay being available for the satisfaction
of the liabilities, if any, under the agreement dated July 6, 1948, the
defendants second set could not be held personally liable for payment of the
decretal amount. The opinion expressed by the High Court is correct and we see
no warrant or justification to interfere with the same.
34\. In view of the foregoing, we have no hesitation in holding that as
material alterations have been made by the plaintiff in the agreement dated
July 6, 1948 (which is the basis of the suit) rendering it void and as the bar
of Section 69 of the Partnership Act clearly applies to the case, the suit is
clearly untenable and has to be dismissed.
35\. In the result, Appeal No. 572 of 1974 is allowed and the suit out of
which it arose is dismissed. Consequently, Appeal No. 416 of 1973 fails and is
dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, parties are left to pay and bear
their own costs of these appeals.
