time of abduction. Suraj Bhan knew the accused before and he also knew his
stature and voice. Suraj Bhan was in the company of Deep Chand from the time
of his abduction till he was finally released. When Suraj Bhan, in the
circumstances, stated that he identified Deep Chand, there is no valid reason
to reject his evidence. In the circumstances, the High Court was quite
justified in setting aside the order of acquittal under s. 458, Indian Penal
Code, and convicting him for the offence under s. 452 there of Finally learned
counsel for the appellant made an impassioned appeal on the question of
sentence. He said that the learned Sessions Judge had awarded a reasonable
sentence to the accused and the High Court was not justified in enhancing the
said sentence. The Sessions Judge held that the accused was guilty of a grave
and heinous crime and we are surprised that he should have sentenced the
accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year under s. 347, 2 years
under s. 365 and 3 1/2 years under s. 386, Indian Penal Code, and direct the
sentences to run concurrently. When the Sessions Judge gave such a
disproportionately lenient sentences, it was the duty of the High Court to
rectify such an obvious error. In our view, the learned Judges of the High
Court rightly enhanced the sentence imposed on the appellant.
In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. Appeal dismissed.
