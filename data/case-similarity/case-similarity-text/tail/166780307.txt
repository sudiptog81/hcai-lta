characterizing the defense as vague, got-up and motivated to evade liability.
46\. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, argued that the breach of
the NDA is a claim for unliquidated damages which does not become crystallized
until legal proceedings are filed, and none have been filed so far. The period
of limitation for filing such proceedings has admittedly not yet elapsed.
Further, the appellant has withheld amounts that were due to the respondent
under the NDA till the matter is resolved.

Admittedly, the matter has never been resolved. Also, the respondent itself
has not commenced any legal proceedings after the e-mail dated 30th January,
2015 except for the present insolvency application, which was filed almost 2
years after the said e-mail. All these circumstances go to show that it is
right to have the matter tried out in the present case before the axe falls.
47\. We, therefore, allow the present appeal and set aside the judgment of the
Appellate Tribunal. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
