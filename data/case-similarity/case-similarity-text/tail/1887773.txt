assignment of the literary and musical work from its owners by entering into
separate agreement of assignment. It is also shown before the court that sound
recording is a different class of work from that of literary and musical work.
The Government of India has also registered two separate Societies one for
carrying on the business of issuing or granting licence in respect of literary
and musical work viz., IPRS and another one in respect of sound recording work
viz., PPL. Unless the third respondent obtains licence for broadcasting
literary and musical work of the members of the applicant Society, they have
no right to broadcast the songs of the members of the applicant Society, it
has been established prima facie before this court.
21\. Under such circumstances, if the third respondent continues to broadcast
the songs of the members of the applicant Society without getting licence from
it, the interest of the applicant and its members would be in jeopardy. It has
also been shown before the court that many radio channels have obtained
licence both from the applicant Society and PPL. The balance of convenience is
found only in favour of the applicant.
22\. Therefore, ad interim injunction already granted by this court is made
absolute and O.A.No.1318 of 2008 stands allowed and Application No.37 of 2009
stands dismissed. There is no order as to costs.
