not ordinarily performed made available and Installation Qualification and
Operational Qualification tests are conducted only were strict requirements
according to WHO Guide to GMP requirements specified by the buyers. The ratio
of the decision in the case of Associate Cement Companies Ltd. is not
applicable as facts are entirely different since the issue involved therein
was assessment of drawings, designs and technical material imported through
couriers. We hold that the value of the manuals has to be added to the value
of the fermenter for the purpose of levy of Customs Duty. We, however, agree
with the learned Advocate that the goods cannot be confiscated merely because
they filed two Bills of Entry as the issue involved is one of interpretation
as to whether the cost of manuals is to be included in the value of imported
goods or not. There is no other allegation that any fact or document was
suppressed from the Department. We, therefore, set aside the confiscation and
consequential redemption fine and penalty imposed on the Appellants. Regarding
eligibility of the impugned fermenter to the benefit of Notification No.
16/2000-Cus., we find that the same has not been considered by the
Adjudicating Authority. We, therefore, remand the matter to the Adjudicating
Authority only to consider hearing the Appellants as to whether the goods in
question are eligible to the benefit of Notification No. 16/2002.
7\. The Appeal is disposed of in the above manners.
