minded, civilized man on whose judgment both Brandeis J. and Bose J. rely,
would he have found the basis of the classification intelligible ? The
questions answer themselves, the arbitrary character of the differentiation is
so obvious. I do not think it is possible to take the rhetoric of Royappa and
Maneka Gandhi seriously and find that the Act passes the test of
reasonableness.
What I have said above on the Special Bearer Bonds scheme should not be read
as an expression of opinion on the wisdom of the government policy-that the
scheme is not the best in circumstances. My conclusion is based not on what
the policy of the government is but on what the equality elause in Art. 14
requires.

Having held that the Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions)
ordinance, 1981 and the Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions) Act,
1981 are invalid on the ground that they infringe Art. 14 of the Constitution,
I do not find it necessary to consider whether Special Bearer Bonds
(Immunities and Exemptions) ordinance, 1981 is outside the ordinance making
power of the President under Art. 123 of the Constitution.
    N.V.K.				  Petitions dismissed.
