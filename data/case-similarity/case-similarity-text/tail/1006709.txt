or a decision of the Court sanctioning something which is illegal, by resort
to the rule of res judicata a party affected by the decision will not be
precluded from challenging the validity of that order under the rule of res
judicata,for a rule of procedure cannot supersede the law of the land.
In the present case the decision of the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Borivli,
that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for determination of
standard rent, is, in view of the judgment of this Court, plainly erroneous :
see Mrs. Dossibai N. B. Jeejeebhoy v. Khemchand Gorumal & Others(1) If the
decision in the previous proceeding be. regarded as conclusive it will assume
the status of a special rule of law applicable to the parties relating to the
jurisdiction 'of the Court in derogation of the rule declared by the
Legislature.
The appeals are allowed, and the orders passed by the High Court and the Court
of Small Causes are set aside and the proceedings are remanded to the Court of
First Instance to deal with and dispose them of in accordance with law. There
will be no order as to costs throughout.
Y.P.
Appeals allowed.
