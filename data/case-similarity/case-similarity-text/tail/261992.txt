entire selection process. The Tribunal did not make any discrimination. One
screening test had already been held. The number of candidates appeared in the
first screening test was 510. The Commission obtained the permission of the
Tribunal for holding the second screening test. It issued a notification on
12.12.2000 stating that such a test would be conducted on 7.1.2001. All the
candidates were given the same time for preparation. Only because the
appellants herein were employees at the relevant time, the same by itself
could not confer on them any special privilege to ask for an extended time.
They had no legal right in relation thereto. Appellants had appeared at the
examination without any demur. They did not question the validity of the said
question of fixing of the said date before the appropriate authority. They
are, therefore, estopped and precluded from questioning the selection process.
15\. For the reasons aforementioned, the appeals of the Andhra Pradesh Public
Service Commission are allowed and that of Marripati Nagaraja is dismissed
with costs. Counsels fee quantified at Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five
thousand only).
16\. The Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission is hereby directed to
finalise the selection process in the light of the judgment of this Court as
expeditiously as possible and not later than three months from the date of
receipt of a copy of this judgment.
