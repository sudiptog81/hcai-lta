Thus, appeal against Smt. Parwatu stood abated. In the instant case, the 1st
Appellate Court rejected the application for condonation of delay as well as
the substitution of LRs of Smt. Parwatu, respondent No. 4 therein. The only
question remains as to whether the appeal is abated in toto or only in respect
of the share of Smt. Parwatu. The High Court has rightly reached the
conclusion that there was a possibility for the Appellate Court to reverse the
Judgment of the Trial Court and in such an  13 eventuality, there could have
been two contradictory decrees, one in favour of Smt. Parwatu and the other,
in favour of the present appellants. The view taken by the High Court is in
consonance with the law laid down by this Court consistently. The facts of the
case do not warrant any further examination of the matter.
21\. In view of the above, the appeal lacks merit and is accordingly
dismissed. No order as to costs.
