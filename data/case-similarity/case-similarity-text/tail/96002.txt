that the testator did intend to create successive life interest in favour of
the successive heirs of his younger son that was held to be not permissible in
law. Under these circumstances, the Court observed that no interest could be
created in favour of an unborn person. The decision relied upon has no
applicability in the facts and circumstances of the instant case. The present
is not a case where any successive interest has been created under the gift
deed. There is no ban on the transfer of interest in favour of an unborn
person. Section 20 permits an interest being created for the benefit of an
unborn person who acquires interest upon his birth. No provision has been
brought to our notice which stipulates that full interest in a property cannot
be created in favour of unborn person. Section 13 has no applicability to the
facts and circumstances of the present case. In the present case, the donor
gifted the property in favour of the appellant, then living, and also
stipulated that if other male children are later born to her brother they
shall be joint holders with the appellant. Such a stipulation is not hit by
Section 13 of the Act. Creation of such a right is permissible under Section
20 of the Act. The respondent, thus, became entitled to the property on his
birth. In this view, there is also no substance in the second contention.
For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is dismissed. The parties are left to
bear their own costs.
