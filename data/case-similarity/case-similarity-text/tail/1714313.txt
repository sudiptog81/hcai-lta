premises were let it does not necessarily follow that the learned judge of the
Court of Small Causes decided the issue of jurisdiction as a question of fact
or a mixed question of law and fact. The manner in which the issue was decided
is itself is a question of fact. It cannot be a question of law. It is
possible that though the document itself is not conclusive as to the purpose
for which the premises were let the decision may have been rendered only as a
question of law.
47\. In the circumstances the three preliminary issues are answered in the
negative. The plaint is accordingly returned to the Plaintiffs to be presented
to the proper Court. The Plaintiffs find themselves in a most unfortunate
situation. The question of jurisdiction was a complicated one. It can by no
stretch of imagination be suggested that the suit was not filed in this Court
bona-fide and with a genuine impression that this Court had jurisdiction. This
is fortified by the judgment of the Small Causes Court. Indeed, in view of the
judgment of the Small Causes Court, it was only natural that the Plaintiffs
filed the suit in this Court. It was filed in this Court bona-fide beyond any
doubt. They succeeded in their contention over thirty years ago. They have
failed in establishing the same contention today. This case on merits cannot
be decided yet. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of this case there shall
be no order as to the costs.
