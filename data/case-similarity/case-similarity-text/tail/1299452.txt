the plaintiff as would not be capable of being undone at a latter stage. The
discretion exercised by the Trial Court and the High Court against the
plaintiff, is neither reasonable nor judicious. The grant of interlocutory
injunction to the plaintiff could not have been refused, therefore, it becomes
obligatory on the part of this Court to interfere.
For the foregoing reasons these appeals are allowed. An ad-interim injunction
under Rules 1 and 2 of Order 39 of the CPC shall issue in favour of the
plaintiff-appellant restraining the defendant-respondents from using directly
or indirectly the word Muktajivan in their trade name associated with the
business and services of colour lab and studio and any other similar word or
name which may be identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs trade
name. The plaintiff-appellant shall be entitled to costs throughout incurred
upto this stage.
Before parting we would like to make it clear that this order is being passed
at an interlocutory stage, and therefore, any observation made by this Court
touching the facts, and any factual finding arrived at this stage would not
come in the way of the Trial Court or Appellate Court in arriving at a final
decision at variance therewith on trial of the issues on merits after
recording the evidence.
