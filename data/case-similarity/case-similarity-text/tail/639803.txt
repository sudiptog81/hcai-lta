in the junior scale. We are unable to accept either of these contentions. As
seen earlier Naqishbund was a party to the preparation of the select list in
order of preference and that he is shown as No. 1 in the list. To that extent
he was undoubtedly a judge in his own case, a circumstance which is abhorrent
to our concept of justice. Now coming to the selection of the officers in the.
junior scale service, the selections to both senior scale service as well as
junior scale service were made from the same pool. Every officer who had put
in a service of 8 years or more, even if he was holding the post of an
Assistant Conservator of Forests was eligible for being selected for the
senior scale service. In fact some (1) [1967] 2 Q.B. 864.

Assistant Conservators have been selected for the senior scale service. At the
same time some of the officers who had put in more than eight years of service
had been selected for the junior scale service. Hence it is not possible to
separate the two sets of officers. For the reasons mentioned above these
petitions are allowed and the impugned selections set aside. The Union
Government and the State Government shall pay the costs of the petitioners.
V.P.S. Petitions allowed.
