Castes and Scheduled Tribes, if either of these two categories is given 2
posts out of 3, interest of justice would be served if we direct the
respondents to reserve 2 posts in all out of II for being filled up by 1
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidate each, in the order of inter se
merits of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe selected candidates as mentioned
in the list at annexure-C. The remaining 9 posts will be available to general
category candidates as listed in order of merits in the list at annexure-C.
The moment these 11 posts are filled up within 1 year of the publication of
list at annexureC this list will get exhausted or if for any reason these II
vacancies could not be filled up by the time one year from the date of
publication of the list is over, even then the list would get exhausted and
fresh recruitment will have to be made in the light of fresh requisition from
the State. For computing one year's currency of impugned select list as per
rule 41, the period during which appointments were stayed during pendency of
these proceed- ings would naturally got excluded. The contention no.8
therefore will stand accepted to the aforesaid extent. In the result this writ
petition fails subject only to the directions issued by us to the State
Government while accepting contention no. 8 aforesaid. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
