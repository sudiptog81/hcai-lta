necessarily cause irreparable loss and injury to the plaintiff. In my
considered opinion, balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiff
and against the defendants.
20\. After this Court passed a restraint order on the defendants in the year
1994, the defendants have been using a different trade mark for their product
by the name "GREEN DOT" and has been using the said trade mark "GREEN DOT" for
the last four years and has achieved goodwill and reputation under the said
trade mark and has been carrying on business under the said trade mark.
21\. Taking note of the aforesaid factors into consideration, I am of the
considered opinion, that the plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie
case for grant of temporary injunction in its favour and against the
defendants pending disposal of the suit and accordingly the order dated
9.11.1994 passed by this Court granting ad interim temporary injunction is
made absolute. Consequently the application registered as I.A. No. 8609/1994
stands allowed and the application registered as I.A. No. 10285/1994 stands
dismissed.
Suit No. 2136/1994.
22\. Let the suit be renotified before the Joint Registrar on 26.2.1999 for
admission/denial of documents. The parties may file additional/original
documents, if any, within four weeks from today.
