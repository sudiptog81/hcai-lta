not agree with the High Court that the finding recorded by authority are based
on no evidence. The High Court should not have interfered with the findings of
the fact reached by the prescribed authority on appreciation of evidence."
Thus in accordance with the above position of law no interference in findings
of facts recorded by the Tribunal is called for. In any event, the petitioner
having died and the monetary benefits accruing under the award as per the
above claim being confined limited up to the date of the death and payable to
his widow, no interference is called for even otherwise under Article 226 of
the Constitution.
7\. In the meanwhile, during the pendency of the dispute before the Tribunal,
the workman also died on 9.7.94 and his widow Ms. Pushpa Sharma was
substituted in his place on 23.2.99. Since the award was stayed by this Court
since July, 2002 up to date and in the meanwhile prior to the interim order of
this Court, the respondent had moved the application under Section 33(C)(1)
for recovery of the awarded amount and the application is still pending and
was not given effect due to the interim orders of this Court, it is directed
that the application preferred by the respondent No. 1's legal heir, Smt.
Pushpa Sharma under Section 33C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act shall be
disposed of on or before 1st April, 2005. Accordingly, the writ petition is
dismissed with the aforesaid directions.
