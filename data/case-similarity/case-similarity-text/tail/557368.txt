of the public in the efficacy of the judicial function would have considerably
impaired.
Now, we have to make up our mind regarding the sentence to be imposed on the
three accused. Learned Counsel for the state pleaded for restoration of the
same sentence which the trial court has imposed, i.e., death penalty. The
question is whether this case can be regarded as rarest of rare cases in which
the lesser alternative is unquestionably foreclosed. Looking at the horrendous
acts committed by the accused, it can doubtlessly be said that this is an
extremely rare case. Nonetheless, a factor which looms large in this case is
that the accused genuinely believed that a hidden treasure trove could be
winched to the surface by infantile sacrifice ceremoniously performed. It is
germane to note that none of the children were abducted or killed for ransom
or for vengeance or for committing robbery. It was due to utter ignorance that
these accused became so gullible to such superstitious thinking. Of course,
such thinking was also motivated by greed for gold. Even so, we persuade
ourselves to choose the normal punishment prescribed for murder as for these
accused. Accordingly, while restoring the sentence passed by the trial court
in respect of other counts of offences, we order that the accused shall
undergo imprisonment for life for the offence under Section 302 read with
Section 34 of the I.P.C.
