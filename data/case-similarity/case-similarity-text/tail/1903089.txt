that at the time of the filing of the letter of intention for furnishing
guarantee parties were not aware that the question of the jurisdiction of the
court would be raised. Not only the parties the court was also aware that the
issue of jurisdiction of the court would be in question. The defendants have
not pressed for dismissal of the suit even when the bank guarantee was
furnished on 17.5.2000. The defendants have not asserted dismissal of suit on
the ground of jurisdiction of the Court at the outset when letter of intention
was furnished by the Punjab National Bank on their behalf nor at the time of
furnishing bank guarantee and waited till 7.7.2001 to file an application.
From reading of Admiralty Rules, it appears that it is a usual and common
practice to issue warrant of arrest if the affidavit filed under Rule 4
contains all particulars required. Thus, it cannot be said that arrest of the
ship was obtained by the plaintiffs suppressing material facts which would
warrant stay of suit by the Court. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of
the view that the defendants have not made out a case for stay of the
proceedings of Admiralty Suit No. 11 of 2000 pending in the Calcutta High
Court and the High Court has committed an error in passing the order of
permanent stay and discharging the bank guarantee. The appeal is allowed with
costs. The order of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside. The
suit shall now proceed in the Calcutta Court in accordance with law.
