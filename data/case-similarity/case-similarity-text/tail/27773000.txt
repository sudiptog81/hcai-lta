entertained unless the Court dealing with the original action has also
jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary in the matter of the counterclaim.

11\. If this were not the case, then it would lead to an absurd result where a
plaintiff would be unable to file a suit in a Court which would lack
territorial jurisdiction whether because no part of the cause of action had
arisen within the territorial limits or where the situs of the land was
situated outside the jurisdiction of the Court. However, if the submission of
Mr. Ghosh were to be accepted, a defendant would be permitted to bring such an
action by way of filing a counterclaim.
12\. I am, therefore, of the view that there is an inherent lack of
jurisdiction in this Court in entertaining the counterclaim. The reliefs
prayed for by the defendant in the counterclaim pertain to possession of a
property outside the jurisdiction of this Court. This Court in its Original
Side has no inherent power to decide on the right, title or interest in
respect of a property lying outside the local jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court.
13\. In the circumstances, I concur with my learned brother that this appeal
should be dismissed.
