impugned order without his being aware of the said case and the discharge
order passed therein by the trying Magistrate.
12\. Mr. Gupta next urged that though the Constitutional validity of the Act
has been recently upheld in West Bengal v. Ashok Dey , that decision requires
reconsideration inasmuch as the circumstances in which the President's rule
was ushered in West Bengal and which formed the considerations on which this
Court upheld the Act's validity no longer subsist. This contention, however,
does not take into account the distinction between the necessity for the Act
and its legal competency. Assuming that the circumstances owing to which the
Act was enacted no longer subsist, that is a manner primarily for the
Legislature and not for this Court to consider. It is true that the
President's rule came to an end recently, but under Article 357(2) of the
Constitution an Act passed by the President thereunder remains in force for
one year the Proclamation made under Article 356 has ceased to operate. The
operation of such an Act is not coterminous with the subsistence of the said
Proclamation. There is, thus, no justification for the plea that the aforesaid
decision, only recently given, need reconsideration.
13\. There is, thus, no merit in either of the two contentions urged on behalf
of the petitioner. Consequenly, the petition must fail and is accordingly
rejected.
