Act. I do not find it relevant that the Extension Laws passed from time to
time were only for the purpose of continuing the 'existing law' or pre-
constitutional law of 1947 in the same form. The fact remains that 'Extension
Laws' made from time to time to revive State Act of 1947, in its application
to the States after the Constitution, were legislations of the State
Legislature on one of the entries in the Concurrent List and each time because
of their repugnancy to the Central Law, they were assented to by the President
to give them overriding effect. My understanding of the proposals contained in
the file is that the 'assent of the President' was obtained each time in a
general way by referring to some of the Central Laws covered by the relevant
entries in the Concurrent List.
99\. My conclusion, therefore, is that the 'assent of the President' to the
State Act having been obtained in a general way, State Act would prevail over
the Central Act.
100\. Consequently this appeal and all connected appeals and writ petitions on
this point succeed. The impugned order of the High Court of Bombay deserves to
be set aside. The cases be sent to competent courts for deciding remaining
legal and factual questions as are involved in each of them. The cost incurred
in this court in each case shall abide the final result of the each case. The
connected SLPs are accordingly disposed of.
