S.C.R. 195 at 228.

Section 196A(2) Cr. P. C. provides that "no court shall take cognizance of the
offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under section 120 B of the Indian
Penal Code, (2) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit any
non-cognizable offence, or a cognizable offence not punishable with death,
imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or
upwards, unless the State Government or a Chief Presidency Magistrate or
District Magistrate empowered in this behalf by the State Government has, by
order in writing, consented to the initiation of the proceedings."
x x x x Since the object of the criminal conspiracy is cheating by personation
under section 419 IPC punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three
years, section 196A(2) is no bar to the present trial in the absence of a
sanction. The fact that the accused are charged with other non-cognizable
offences in the same trial cannot affect the validity of the trial. There is
no merit in this appeal which is dismissed. The records shallbe despatched
immediately to the trial court which will dispose of the case at an early
date.
    S.R.			     Appeal dismissed'.
