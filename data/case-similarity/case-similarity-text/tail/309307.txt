made during the course of hearing has been noted by us only to be summarily
rejected. We have already held that the appellant is the owner of the suit
property entitled to its possession and recovery of arrears of rent from the
defendant No.2.
The offshoot of the above discussion is that no question of law much less a
substantial question of law arose in the case worth being gone into the by the
High Court in exercise of its second appellate jurisdiction under Section 100
of the CPC. The High Court was bound by the findings of fact arrived at by the
two courts below and should not have entered into the exercise of re-
appreciating and evaluating the evidence. The findings of facts arrived at by
the courts below did not suffer from any perversity. There was no non-reading
or misreading of the evidence. A high degree of preponderance of probability
proving title to the suit property was raised in favour of the appellant and
the courts below rightly concluded the burden of proof raised on the plaintiff
having been discharged while the onus shifting on the defendant remaining
undischarged. The judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and has to be
set aside.
For the reasons stated above, the appeal is accepted. Judgment and decree of
the High Court is set aside and that of the trial court as confirmed by the
first appellate Court is restored. No costs.
