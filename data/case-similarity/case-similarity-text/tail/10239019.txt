complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time bound and in any case
it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the causes of it must
be reflected in the General Diary entry.
viii) Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all
information received in a police station, we direct that all information
relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of FIR or
leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the
said Diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be
reflected, as mentioned above.
112) With the above directions, we dispose of the reference made to us. List
all the matters before the appropriate Bench for disposal on merits.
