ORDER IN CIVIL APPLICATIONS
1\. In view of the order passed in the main matter, both the civil
applications shall not survive. They stand disposed of accordingly. 1. At this
stage, Mr. Navin Pahwa learned advocate appearing for Mr. P M Thakkar for the
appellant-defendants requests for time to prefer appeal. Mr. Y J Trivedi
learned advocate appearing for the respondents-plaintiffs has strongly
objected towards the grant of time.
2\. Initially, this Court was not inclined to grant the request made by the
learned advocate for the appellant. However, since Mr. Pahwa learned advocate
has stated that the opportunity to prefer an appeal should not be taken away
from the appellant, I am of the opinion that some time can be granted to the
appellant to prefer the same. 3. In above view of the matter, interim relief
granted earlier is extended upto 23/05/2005.
