In the ultimate analysis, we are clearly of view that the impugned condition
i.e., condition No.2 as reproduced hereinabove D.B. Civil Writ Petition
No.12471/2012  13 in the regulations framed by the respondent-University
deserves to be quashed as illegal and the respondent-University deserves to be
directed to provide the certified copy of the answer-book to the petitioner
after charging the fees as prescribed under the Rajasthan Rules of 2005 and
not beyond.
As a result of the aforesaid, the writ petition succeeds and is allowed. The
questioned condition in the regulations of the respondent-University i.e.,
condition No.2 as regards charging of Rs.1,000/- as fees for providing copies
of the answer-books is declared illegal and is quashed. The respondent
University shall be required to provide the necessary information after
charging the fee as contemplated by the Rajasthan Rules of 2005 and not
beyond.
Having regard to the circumstances of the case and particularly when we find
that a student has unnecessarily been driven to this avoidable litigation, we
allow costs of the litigation to the writ petitioner, quantified at
Rs.11,000/- (eleven thousand).
