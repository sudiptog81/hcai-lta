"undesirable". Even if the Plaintiff could not force a change in name under
Section 22, there can be no difficulty in the Defendant's invoking Section 21
of the Companies Act to achieve this result.
27\. The Appeal has merit and is allowed. The impugned Orders are modified to
the extent that the Defendants are restrained from using the word 'Atlas' in
their corporate/trade name in respect of bicycles and bicycle parts. All
pending applications are disposed of.
FAO(OS) 280/2003
28\. We shall now consider FAO(OS) 280/2003. In our view there can be no two
opinions on the fact that the Order impugned in FAO(OS) 395/2002 injuncted the
Defendants from using the trade mark 'Atlas' but did not restrain the
Defendants from using 'Atlas' in their corporate name. Once this conclusion is
arrived at the challenge to the impugned Order dated 30.5.2003 loses all its
strength. In fact, keeping in view the arguments addressed before us in
FAO(OS) 395/2002 we would have accepted learned Counsel for the Appellants not
to press the present Appeal. We are in agreement with the learned Single Judge
that the public notices issued by the Defendants, to which the appellants have
taken objection, do not give the impression to the public that this Court has
permitted the Defendants to use the word 'Atlas' as their trade mark.
29\. Appeal as well as pending applications is dismissed.
