decree in that behalf without relegating the parties to a further suit for
damages. This procedure would act as a check on abuse of the process of the
court and adequately compensate the damages or injury suffered by the
defendant by act of court at the behest of the plaintiff.
15\. Public purpose of removing traffic congestion was sought to be served by
acquiring the building for widening the road. By orders of injunction, for 24
years the public purpose, was delayed. As a consequence execution of the
project has been delayed and the costs now stand mounted. The courts in the
cases where injunction are to be granted should necessarily consider the
effect on public purpose thereof and also suitably mould the relief. In the
event the plaintiffs losing ultimately the suit, they should necessarily bear
the consequences, namely, escalation of the cost or the damages the
Corporation suffered on account of injunction issued by the courts. Appellate
court had not adverted to any of the material aspects of the matter.
Therefore, the High Court has rightly, though for different reasons, dissolved
the order of ad interim injunction. Under these circumstances, in the event of
the suit to be dismissed while disposing of the suit the trial court is
directed to assess the damages and pass a decree for recovering the same at
pro rata against the appellants.
16\. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.
