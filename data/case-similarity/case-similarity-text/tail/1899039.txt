the appeal and issue an injunction restraining defendants I to 4 by
themselves, their servants, agents, dealers, stockists from infringing the
plaintiffs' territorial copyrights/rights/license by importing, distributing
and offering for sale in India the 13 titles which admittedly they are
importing into India. I would permit the defendants to sell their existing
stocks as on the date of this order. But no further imports will be made. The
defendants will keep accounts of the sale of the existing stocks and submit
the same in court every three months. They will also submit an account of
their existing stocks within a week.
(50) The plaintiffs are ordered to furnish within one month a bank guarantee
in the sum of Rs. one lakh as a cross-undertaking in damages for the loss
which the defendants may sustain in case the plaintiffs fail in the suit.
(51) The learned judge awarded heavy costs against the plaintiffs. I think the
proper way to deal with costs of this appeal and the costs below is to make
them costs in. the cause. If the plaintiffs succeed in the suit they will get
their costs. If they fail they will have to pay them.
(52) One word more before I hold my peace. In an interlocutory appeal the loss
said about the merits of the case the better. Needless to say that what I have
said here will not prejudice either party at the trial.
(53) I would order an expeditious trial.
