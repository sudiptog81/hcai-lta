CS(OS) No.2407/2013 Page 28 of 29
26\. The mere glance at the product of the plaintiff reveals many similarities
with the above said designs of the helmets of STUDDS and AIROH. Therefore, the
plaintiff's product is not dissimilar from the designs of these two companies
or combination thereof and hence falls within the purview of Section 4(c) of
the Act.
27\. There are various manufacturers already making such designs with the
claimed "Beak Shape" and have been marketing across the world. An internet
search reveals various such similarly designed helmets. The details and
pictures of the same are mentioned earlier in this order.
28\. Even otherwise the addition of small feature here or there from the
features of STUDDS and AIROH helmets' design would not make any difference
which could only be called as routine type of trade variation as per demand of
customers for their conveniences and advantages.
29\. Thus, prima facie I do not find the plaintiff's design being new or
original and is not meant for protection. The interim injunction is thus
accordingly liable to be vacated. Ordered accordingly. Both the applications
are disposed of.
