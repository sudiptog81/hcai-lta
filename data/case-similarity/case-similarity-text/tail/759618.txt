view that there is no case made out by the Appellants to interfere with the
order of dismissal of the Notice of Motion but for the reasons recorded in
this Judgement. Therefore, we have though interfered with the reasoning but
considering the over all view of the matter as recorded above, we are also of
the view not to interfere with the order of dismissal of Notice of Motion.
47\. After visual examination of the registered design cap of the Appellants
and the cap of the Respondents, we are of the prima-facie view that both the
caps are dissimilar in shape. No case of piracy or any infringement is made
out. There is no case of imitation of registered design of the Appellants.
(Polar Industries Ltd.) (Supra)
48\. We are of the view that, cap is an article within the ambit of definition
of "an article" under Section 2(1) of the Design Act, unless set aside. It is
binding at this stage. Both the caps in question, are not similar and
identified as contemplated under the Act. There is no case made out for grant
of any injunction.
49\. Taking all this into account, the reasonings given by the learned Judge
are reversed and quashed and set aside on both the above counts but the order
of dismissal of Notice of Motion is maintained.
50\. In the result, for the above reasons the Appeal is disposed off.
No order as to costs.
