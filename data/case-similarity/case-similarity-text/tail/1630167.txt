an interlocutory order may disrupt the respondent's business. But that cannot
be seen as an argument which should deter us from granting relief to the
appellant to which we are otherwise satisfied it is entitled.
The High Courts' finding that no prejudice would be caused to the appellant
because it had another domain name was a consideration which might have been
relevant if there was a case of bonafide concurrent use and where the right to
use was co-equal. The doubtful explanation given by the respondent for the
choice of the word ''Sify'' coupled with the reputation of the appellant can
rationally lead us to the conclusion that the respondent was seeking to cash
in on the appellant's reputation as a provider of service on the internet. In
view of our findings albeit prima facie on the dishonest adoption of the
appellant's tradename by the respondent, the investments made by the appellant
in connection with the trade name, and the public association of the tradename
Sify with the appellant, the appellant is entitled to the relief it claims. A
different conclusion may be arrived at if evidence to the contrary is adduced
at the trial. But at this stage and on the material before the Court, we are
of the view that the conclusion of the High Court to the contrary was
unwarranted.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. The decision of the High Court is set aside
and that of the City Civil Court affirmed. There will be no order as to costs.
