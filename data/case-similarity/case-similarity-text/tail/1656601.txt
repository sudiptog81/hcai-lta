Panda as the law secretary, Shri T. Misra as superintendent and legal
remembrancer and Shri P.K. Mohanti as the deputy law secretary. That part of
the High Court's order is clearly unsustainable. But as mentioned earlier, the
government has already implemented that part of the order as well. Those
officers are now functioning in the posts to which they were transferred. The
learned Attorney-General told 'us that the government has no objection to
those officers continuing in those posts for the present. We are sure if any
change is required the same will be effected by mutual understanding between
the High Court and the government.
In the result these appeals are partly allowed and the order of the High Court
holding that Shri B.K. Patro, Shri K.K. Bose and Shri P.C. Dey had no
authority to hold the posts they were holding on or after October 10, 1966 is
set aside. Though we hold that the orders of the High Court posting Shri B.K.
Panda as law secretary, Shri T. Misra as superintendent and legal remembrancer
and Shri P.K. Mohanti as deputy law secretary were excess of its powers, we do
not set aside the mandamus issued by it for the reasons mentioned earlier. In
other respects the judgment appealed against is upheld.
The parties will bear their own costs in these appeals. R.K.P.S.
Appeals allowed in part.
