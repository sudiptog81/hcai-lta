the passage of time, in the given circumstances, including interim orders
passed by this Court in SLP (C) No. 16372 of 1985 and other related affairs,
we make it clear that the admissions and appointments that have become final,
shall remain unaffected by this judgment."
[Emphasis supplied] In this case we find that the appellant had joined the
Regional Engineering College in the year 1992. He completed the course of his
studies in the year 1996 under the interim orders of this Court which were
subject to the final orders to be passed in the writ petition. No purpose
would be served in withholding the declaration of the result on the basis of
the examination already taken by him or depriving him of the degree in case he
passes the examination. In terms of the orders passed by the Constitution
Bench of this Court in State of Maharashtra Vs. Milind & Ors., (Supra) we
direct that his result be declared and he be allowed to take his degree with
the condition he will not be treated as a Scheduled Caste candidate in future
either in obtaining service or for any other benefits flowing from the caste
certificate obtained by him. His caste certificate has been ordered to be
cancelled. Henceforth, he will be treated as a person belonging to the general
category for all purposes.
For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order
dated 15.3.2002 passed by the High Court of Kerala is set aside.
