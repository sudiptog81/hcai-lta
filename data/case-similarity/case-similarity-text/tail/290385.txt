(i) that a copy of the preliminary enquiry report was not furnished to the
respondent and (ii) that the complainant or her husband were not examined at
the enquiry and, therefore, the respondent had no opportunity to cross-examine
them.
7\. After hearing the counsel for both the parties, we are satisfied that the
order of the Tribunal cannot stand. Taking the second ground first, we find
that even though the complainant or her husband were not examined at the
regular enquiry, there is other evidence including the evidence of the co-
worker and another co-patient upon which the finding recorded against the
respondent can be sustained. The Tribunal could not have gone into the
adequacy of evidence. It could interfere only if it is a case of "no evidence"
-- and that is not the case here. Coming to the first ground, the respondent
has not shown that there is any rule requiring that the preliminary enquiry
report should be served upon the delinquent officer/employee before commencing
the enquiry. No prejudice is shown to have resulted to the respondent on
account of not supplying the said report. In the circumstances, the findings
of the disciplinary authority could not have been interfered with by the
Tribunal.
8\. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment in order to the
Tribunal is set aside. No costs.
