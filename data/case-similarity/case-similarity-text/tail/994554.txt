highest authorities including the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech after
considering the financial implications of the grant of the exemption to milk.
It was found that the overall benefit to the state's economy and the public
would be greater if the exemption were allowed. The respondents have passed on
the benefit of that exemption by providing various facilities and concessions
for the upliftment of the milk producers. This has not been denied. It would,
in the circumstances, be inequitable to allow the State Government now to
resile from its decision to exempt milk and demand the purchase tax with
retrospective effect from 1st April 1996 so that the respondents cannot in any
event re-adjust the expenditure already made. The High Court was also right
when it held that the operation of the estoppel would come to an end with the
1987 decision of the Cabinet. In the case before us, the power in the State
Government to grant exemption under the Act is coupled with the word "may" 
signifying the discretionary nature of the power. We are of the view that the
State Government's refusal to exercise its discretion to issue the necessary
notification "abolishing" or exempting the tax on milk was not reasonably
exercised for the same reasons that we have upheld the plea of promissory
estoppel raised by the respondents. We, therefore, have no hesitation in
affirming the decision of the High Court and dismissing the appeals without
costs.
