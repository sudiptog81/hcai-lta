Similarly I have some hesitation about the English rendering of Ex. 32 which
is letter dated 8th June, 1982 which has been set out by my learned brother
and which has been set out in his judgment which contains the expression "I do
not know why there is such a dirty atmosphere in the house?" As the original
letter was read out in Court and we had the advantage of that, I am inclined
to take the view that the correct and the more expressive expression would be
"I do not know why there is such a foul atmosphere in the house?" Read in that
light and in the context of other factors, this letter causes some anxiety. It
the deceased was sensing foul atmosphere, why was it? But this again is only a
doubt. It does not prove the guilt of the accused.
In view of the fact that this is a case of circumstantial evidence and further
in view of the fact that two views are possible on the evidence on record, one
pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other his innocence, the accused
is entitled to have the benefit of one which is favourable to him. In that
view of the matter I agree with my learned brothers that the guilt of the
accused has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
In the premises as indicated before, I agree with the order proposed.
