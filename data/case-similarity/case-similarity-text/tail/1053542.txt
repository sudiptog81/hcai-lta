prospective operation but levy of taxation at higher rate which really amounts
to imposition of tax with retrospective operation has 842 to be justified on
proper and cogent grounds. This aspect of the matter does not appear to have
been properly considered by the High Court and the High Court in our view was
not right in holding that by the enactment of  S. 2 of the impugned Act the
very basis of the complaint made by the petitioner before this Court in the
earlier writ petition as also the basis of the decision of this Court in
Cawasji's case that the State is collecting amounts by way of tax in excess of
what was authorised under the Act has been removed". We, accordingly, set
aside the judgment and order of the High Court to the extent it upholds the
validity of the impugned amendment with retrospective effect from Ist of
April, 1966 and to the extent it seeks to nullify the earlier judgment of the
High Court. We declare that S. 2 of the impugned amendment to the extent that
it imposes the higher levy of 45% with retrospective effect from the Ist day
of April, 1966 and S. 3 of the impugned Act seeking to nullify the judgment
and order of the High Court are invalid and unconstitutional.
We accordingly allow the appeals to this extent. The appellants shall be
entitled to costs of these appeals with one set of hearing fee.
N.V.K. Appeals allowed.
