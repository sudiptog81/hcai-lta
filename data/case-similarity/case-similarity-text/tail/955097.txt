in the interest of the parties. Learned counsel for the appellants fairly
stated that the question relating to bar of jurisdiction in terms of Section
111 of the Old Act corresponding to Section 124 of the New Act shall not be
raised and the trial Court would be free to proceed with the suit.
In the aforesaid background we direct the trial Court to dispose of the suit
as early as practicable preferably by the end of January, 2006. Residual
question is whether as contended by learned counsel for the appellants the
protection given by the High Court while disposing of the appeal and extended
by this Court initially by orders dated 27.5.2005 and 13.7.2005 should be
continued as the conclusions of the trial Court as affirmed by the High Court
are erroneous in law and the appellants have a fair chance of success in the
suit. On the other hand, it was pointed out by learned counsel for the
respondents that the respondents have succeeded before two courts and the
correct position in law has been kept in view.
On the peculiar circumstances, we feel it would be desirable to vary the
interim order to the extent that there shall not be stay of operation of the
High Court's order but without leave of the trial Court the respondents shall
not initiate any action for user of the mark NIMA by the appellants till the
disposal of the suit.
The appeal is disposed of without any order as to costs.
