that the civil court had no jurisdiction.
8\. The learned counsel for the appellants, Shri R.B. Datar, however,
contended that the trial court as well as the first appellate court had
decided all the issues involved in the case in favour of the plaintiffs-
appellants and in case we come to the conclusion, as indeed we have come to,
that the jurisdiction of the civil court is not barred, the judgment of the
first appellate court should be confirmed and there is no need to remand the
case again to the High Court for deciding it afresh on merits.
9\. We are not inclined to accept the contention raised by the counsel for the
appellants. A number of issues were involved in the case and the High Court
has decided the case only on the ground of jurisdiction and no other point has
been dealt with. It will not be fair to the respondents to accept the finding
of the first appellate court without the same being examined by the High
Court.
10\. For the reasons given above the judgment of the High Court cannot be
sustained. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment of the High
Court is set aside and the case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the
other issues involved in the case on merits. However, this decision will be
without any prejudice to the respondents' rights, if any, under any other
enactment. There shall, however, be no orders as to costs.
