3\. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of
any offence and make out a case against the accused."
As mentioned earlier, the allegations made in the complaint, even if they are
taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute
any offence as against the appellants. Therefore, the complaint filed by the
respondent and the FIRs registered in pursuance thereof are liable to be
quashed. Trisuns Chemical Industry v. Rajesh Agarwal & Ors. 1999(8) SCC 686
cited by learned counsel for the complainant is clearly distinguishable as in
the said case the allegation in the complaint was that the complainant had
paid in advance a price higher than the market price for purchasing "toasted
soyabean extracts" but the accused sent the commodity which was of most
inferior and substandard quality due to which the complainant suffered a loss
of Rs.17 lakhs. In view of the allegations made in the complaint, the matter
required investigation and the proceedings could not have been quashed on the
ground that the dispute was of a civil nature. In the result, the appeals are
allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated January 16, 2002 of the High
Court is set aside and the complaint filed by the Respondent no.2 and the FIRs
registered in pursuance thereof as Case Crime Nos.5 of 2001, 13 of 2001 and 18
of 2001, as against the appellants, are quashed.
