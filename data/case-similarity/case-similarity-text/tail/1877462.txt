in question, if the Act' is otherwise valid, nas to bo rejected.
171\. It is rather regrettable to note that notwithstanding the clear guidance
and lead given by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the previous
decision, that has not been properly availed of when this Act, in question,
was enacted.
172\. In the result, all these writ petitions are allowed and the proceedings
challenged therein are quashed and a writ of mandamus will issue forbearing
the respondent therein from taking further ation on the basis of the Kerala
Land Tax Act, 1961, Act 13 of 1961, or the rules framed thereunder.
173\. In reply to view of the fact that the writ petitions are allowed because
of the Act being declared unconstitutional, I am not expressing any opinion
regarding any other contentions that have been taken regarding the
applicability or otherwise of the Act to particular cases even on the
assumption that the Act is a valid piece of legislation. These questions do
not arise for consideration for the present.
174\. As the State has not even discharged the duty cast upon it under Section
6(3} by specifying the necessary form for enabling the parties concerned, to
claim reller under Section 6(2) of the Act, within the time mentioned in the
Act, the Stale will pay the costs of the petitioners in all these writ
petitions.
