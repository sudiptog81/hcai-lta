that the award of the arbitrator on a question of law is immune from a
challenge in a Court only when it is rendered on a specific question of law
referred to him and that the same was not the situation in the present matter.
The Division Bench has accepted this submission of the respondent and held
that in the present case there was no specific question of law referred to the
arbitrators or the umpire. It held that what was referred for arbitration was
the determination of the claim of the appellant against the respondent, and
that an incidental question involving interpretation cannot be said to be a
specific question of law.
39\. However, we are not required to go into that issue since we are otherwise
holding that the award was not only a plausible one but a well-reasoned award.
In the circumstance the interference by the High Court was not called for. In
that view of the matter we allow this  3 appeal and set aside the judgment of
the learned single Judge, as well as that of the Division Bench. The award
made by the Umpire is upheld and there shall be a decree in terms of the
award. The arbitration petition filed by the respondent for setting aside the
award shall stand dismissed with cost.
