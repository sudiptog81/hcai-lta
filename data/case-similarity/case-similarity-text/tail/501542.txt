'review' and raise the same grounds and seek an oral hearing in the IA for
'recall'. In fact, learned senior counsel Sri C.S. Viadyanathan proceeded to
hand over certain fresh documents in this IA to contend that the case of this
applicant is also one where section 48 could be favourably applied in her
favour. The handing over of these documents in this manner is seriously
objected to by the respondents. If the applicant is so advised, she may file
these documents in the pending review application. But we cannot pass orders
in this IA which virtually amounts to giving a disposal to her pending review
petition 21/2000. We, therefore, reject this application however, permitting
the applicant to move the Registry to have the Review application listed in
Chambers. IA 3 is disposed of accordingly. Point 8 is decided accordingly.
In the result, the IAs, 3 to 5 are disposed of as stated above and the W.P.
155/2000 is rejected permitting petitioner to move the High Court. The .direc-
tions given under Point 6 shall be taken note of by the applicant Sri Gurdip
Singh Uban and the respondents. The observations made under Point 8 will be
taken note of by Mrs. Har Kiran Commar and the respondent, In the normal
course, we should have imposed heavy costs on the applicant Sri Gurdip Singh
Uban for filing application for 'recall', 'modify' and 'recall' after
dismissal of review petition. But. as some relief is granted, on concession,
we are not imposing costs.
