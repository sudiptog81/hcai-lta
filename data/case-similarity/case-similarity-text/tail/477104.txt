Nos. 11871 and 11872 of 1989 and the said writ petitions will stand allowed.
We make it clear that only so far as the components already manufactured or
being manufactured by the Units bear only the markings or inscriptions noted
and referred to by us in this judgment, there could be the availing of the
exemption under the Notification. We make no order as to costs.
9\. We are told that by way of interim measure both at the stage of pendency
of the writ petitions as well as of the writ appeals, the Units were obliged
to pay one-third of the duty on the components manufactured by them, without
reference to the Notification. Now the writ petitions have been allowed, the
Units, who paid such duty, are en-titled for refund. Furthermore, we are told
that as part of the interim measure, there was also furnishing of security for
the balance of two-thirds in the form of personal bonds. Those bonds will now
stand cancelled.
10\. At this stage, Mr. P. Narasimhan, learned Senior Central Government
Standing Counsel appearing for respondents 1 to 3 asks leave of us to appeal
to the Supreme Court of India. We have decided the issues only keeping in mind
the well-accepted norms of interpretation of an exemption Notification. We do
not think that these matters involve any substantial question of law of
general importance requiring decision at the hands of the Supreme Court of
India. Hence, the oral leave asked for is refused.
