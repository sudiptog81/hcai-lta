alone. The invoices produced by the Defendant themselves show that the
products of the Defendant are also referred to as 'MARINE PLUS COP', 'JJ
MARINE PLUS, 'JJ MARINE PLUS CLP, 'J MARINE PLUS COP', i.e. 'MARINE PLUS'
being the leading and essential feature and not 'JIVANJOR'. Furthermore, the
fact that the Defendant refers to its 'mark' as 'JIVANJOR MARINE PLUS ' itself
is an admission on the part of the Defendant that 'MARINE PLUS' is being used
as a trademark/part of its trademark. Whether the rival marks are similar or
not will have to be approached from the point of view of average intelligence
and imperfect recollection of consumers who would normally be carpenters or
such similarly literate persons and are bound to get confused.

prayer clauses (a), (b) and (c ). The Defendant shall pay cost of the Notice
of Motion to the Plaintiff.
