assess the ground realities and the relevant factors and can mould the reliefs
as the circumstances warrant. In the present case restoration of the status
quo ante would not have been the proper relief even if the notifications were
declared invalid.
(5) The Assembly is constituted in terms of Section 73 of the R.P. Act on the
conditions indicated therein being fulfilled and there is no provision in the
Constitution which is in any manner contrary or repugnant to the said
provision. On the contrary, Article 327 of the Constitution is the source of
power for enactment of Section 73.
(6) In terms of Article 361 Governor enjoys complete immunity. Governor is not
answerable to any Court for exercise and performance of powers and duties of
his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise
of those powers and duties. However, such immunity does not take away power of
the Court to examine validity of the action including on the ground of mala
fides.
(7) It has become imperative and necessary that right persons are chosen as
Governors if the sanctity of the post as the Head of the Executive of a State
is to be maintained.
The writ applications are accordingly dismissed but without any order as to
costs.
