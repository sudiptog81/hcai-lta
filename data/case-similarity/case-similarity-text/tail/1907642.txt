scheme of the Act and it was intended to be levied on all the lands falling
within the area but as this cess on royalty is without the authority the
result will be that the cess is levied so far as lands other than the lands in
which mines are situated are concerned but lands where mines are situated this
levy of cess is not in accordance with that law. This anomaly could have been
averted if the Legislature in this explanation had used words 'surface rent'
in place of royalty. Even if the lands where mines are situated and which are
subject to licence and mining leases even for those lands there is a charge on
the basis of the surface of the land which is sometimes described as surface
rent or sometimes also as 'dead rent'. It could not be doubted that if such a
surface rent or dead rent is a charge or an impo- sition on the land only and
therefore will clearly fall within the purview of entry 49 List H and if a
cess is levied on that it will also be justified as tax on land falling within
the purview of entry 49 and it will also be uniform as this cess would be
levied in respect of the lands irrespective of the fact as to whether the land
is one where a mine is situated or land which is only used for other purposes
for which land revenue is chargeable.
