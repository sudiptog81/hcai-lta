Goods Act, it is the transfer of property in goods which attracts sales tax.
In the case of transfer of the right to use goods it is delivery of possession
to be lessee for its use which is made taxable. The court found that the
impugned Act was not in contravention of article 269 of the Constitution and
was therefore, not ultra vires the legislative competence of the State
Legislature.
19\. The petitioner field an additional affidavit enclosing orders of the
Appellate Deputy Commissioner, Kakinada, on 15th November, 1989, in regard to
assessment years 1986-87, holding that under the terms and conditions of the
agreement, there is no transfer of the right to use the machinery in favour of
the contractor. We can only observe that these orders have our approval in
view of the conclusion reached by us.
20\. For all these reasons we hold that providing machinery of whatever
description to the contractor by the petitioner in connection with the
execution of its work does not amount to transfer of the right to use the
machinery, so imposition of sales tax on the hire charges of the machinery
under section 5-E of the Act is ultra vires the section and is, therefore,
illegal. The writ petition is accordingly allowed but, having regard to the
circumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.
21\. Writ petition allowed.
