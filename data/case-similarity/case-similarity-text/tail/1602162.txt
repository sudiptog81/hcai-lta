PATHAK, J.-I must confess to some hesitation in accepting the proposition that
the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is a "State" within the meaning of
Art. 12 of the Constitution. But in view of the direction taken by the law in
this Court since Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority. I
find I must lean in favour of that conclusion. I would have welcomed a wider
range of debate before us on the fundamental principles involved in the issue
and on the implications flowing from the definition in the Companies Act, 1956
of a "Government Company", but perhaps a future case may provide that.
As regards the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976 I
am unable to see any support for the proposition in the provisions of that
Act. The provisions will apply to any Government Company, and they do not
alter the basic nature of that company. They are provisions which could well
have been applied to a private corporation, if the Act had selected one for
vesting the undertaking in it. Would that have made the private corporation a
"State"?
On the merits of the petitioner's claim I need say no more than that I agree
with my learned brothers that the petitioner should be granted the relief
proposed by them.
    P.B.R.					   Petition allowed.
