during an illegal search; (8) A presumption under Section 54 of the Act can
only be raised after the prosecution has established that the accused was
found to be in possession of the contraband in a search conducted in
accordance with the mandate of Section 50. An illegal search cannot entitle
the prosecution to raise a presumption under Section 54 of the Act (9) That
the judgment in Pooran Mal's case cannot be understood to have laid down that
an illicit article seized during a search of a person, on prior information,
conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 50 of the Act, can by
itself be used as evidence of unlawful possession of the illicit article on
the person from whom the contraband has been seized during the illegal search;
(10) That the judgment in Ali Mustaffa's case correctly interprets and
distinguishes the judgment in Pooran Mal's case and the broad observations
made in Pirthi Chand's case and Jasbir Singh's case are not in tune with the
correct exposition of law as laid down in Pooran Mal's case. The above
conclusions are not a summary of our judgment and have to be read and
considered in the light of the entire discussion contained in the earlier
part.
We, accordingly, answer the reference in the manner aforesaid.
Let the Criminal Appeals and Special Leave Petitions be now placed for
disposal before an appropriate Bench.
