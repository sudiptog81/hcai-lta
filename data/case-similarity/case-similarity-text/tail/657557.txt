understand the consequences of withdrawal of the writ petition. Therefore, all
orders passed by the High Court and the statutory authority stood washed away
on withdrawal of the said writ petition and the said writ petitioners cannot
claim any benefit of either of the same.
33\. In view of the above, appeals deserve to be allowed to the effect that
the appellant and the respondent-Society may act as if no order had ever been
passed, adversely affecting their contract, by the High Court in Writ  21
Petition No.2366 of 2007 or any statutory authority and they may proceed with
the agreement/contract in accordance with law.
34\. Needless to say that this judgment/order would have no bearing on the
order passed by any court/tribunal or statutory authority independent of the
proceedings taken in Writ Petition No. 2366 of 2007.
35\. The appeals are allowed as explained hereinabove. No order as to cost.
