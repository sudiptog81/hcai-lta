accordingly. But there is a rider to these well established principles. This
can be done only in exceptional circumstances, some of which have been
highlighted above. This equitable principles cannot, however, stand on the way
of the court adjudicating the rights already vested by a statute. This well
settled position need not detain us, when the second point urged by the
appellants is focused. There can be no quarrel with the proposition as noted
by the High Court that a party cannot be made to suffer on account of an act
of the Court. There is a well recognised maxim of equity, namely, actus curiae
neminem gravabit which means an act of the Court shall prejudice no man. This
maxim is founded upon justice and good sense which serves a safe and certain
guide for the administration of law. The other maxim is, lex non cogit ad
impossibilia, i.e. the law does not compel a man to do that what he cannot
possibly perform. The applicability of the abovesaid maxims has been approved
by this Court in Raj Kumar Dey and ors. vs. Tarapada Dey and Ors. 1987 (4) SCC
398, Gursharan Singh vs. New Delhi Municipal Committees 1996 (2) SCC 459 and
Mohammed Gazi vs. State of M.P. and Ors. 2000 (4) SCC 342."
45\. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that the impugned
judgments cannot be sustained which are set aside accordingly. The matters may
now be considered afresh by the High Court in the light of the observations
made hereinbefore. These appeals are allowed. No costs.
