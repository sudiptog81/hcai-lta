is not void. There is also nothing to show that if the. the negative covenant
is enforced the appellant would be driven to idleness or would be compelled to
go back to the respondent company. It may be that if he is not permitted to
get himself employed in another similar employment he might perhaps get a
lesser remuneration than the one agreed to by Rajasthan Rayon. But that is no
consideration against enforcing the covenant. The evidence is clear that the
appellant has torn the agreement to pieces only because he was offered a
higher remuneration. Obviously he cannot be heard to say that no injunction
should be granted against him to enforce the negative covenant which is not
opposed to public policy. The injunction issued against him is restricted as
to time, the nature of employment and as to area and cannot therefore be said
to be too wide or unreasonable or unnecessary for the protection of the
interests of the respondent company. As regards Clause 9 the injunction is to
restrain him from divulging any and all information, instruments, documents,
reports etc. which may have come to his knowledge while he was serving the
respondent company. No serious objection was taken by Mr. Sen against this
injunction and therefore we need say no more about it.
The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
