cause of action from that upon which the primary relief in the Spl. Suit was
founded.
In Sidramappa v. Rajashetty [AIR 1970 SC 1059 at pp. 1060-61 = (1970) 1 SCC
186 at 189], this Court held that where the cause of action on the basis of
which the previous suit was brought, does not form the foundation of the
subsequent suit, and in the earlier suit, the plaintiff could not have claimed
the relief which he sought in the subsequent suit, the plaintiff's subsequent
suit is not barred by order 2 Rule 2. Applying this ruling to the facts of the
present case, it is clear that, in the first suit, the appellants could only
claim reliefs in respect of Rs.14,12,836/- which was the maximum amount
stipulated in the performance guarantee. They could not have claimed reliefs
of Rs.1,13,27,298.16 which they did in the second suit on the basis of the
contract relating to the work to be performed by the contractor.
It is, therefore, clear that when the appellants, by way of Short Cause Suit
No.491/72, sought to enforce the performance guarantee no.57/22, they were
seeking reliefs on the basis of a cause of action which was distinct from the
one upon which they subsequently based their claim in Spl. Civil Suit No.
29/83.
In the result, both the issues are decided in favour of the appellants. The
appeal succeeds. No costs.
