newspaper etc., at the head of the front or editorial page. Thus, the very
name was conceived for the newspaper. At the most the name Eenadu could be a
household name of newspaper, but we are dealing with Agarbathis. Even though
it was in evidence that word Eenadu is being used by various other persons
including a Cooperative Bank, but that cannot be a ground to non-suit the
plaintiff. Thus, it is established that the plaintiff acquiesced his right to
restrain the defendant from using the mark Eenadu under Section 41(g) and (1)
of Specific Relief Act. It is not the case of plaintiff that the defendant has
been selling the Agarbathis surreptitiously without the knowledge of the
plaintiff. The ingredients required for successfully establishing the passing
off action are not established in this case by the plaintiff. The learned
trial Court was under mistaken impression that the plaintiff got to trademark
of Eenadu Telugu and English version for the goods falling in class 16 and 26.
It is the admitted case of plaintiff that it made application for registration
only awaiting registration. Thus, I find that the trial Court completely
misdirected itself on facts and law.
75\. For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment and decree of the
lower Court in O.S. No. 555 of 1999, dated 24-7-2000 and allow the appeal
C.C.C.A. No. 178 of 2000 without costs and dismiss the suit with costs. In
view of this judgment, C.C.C.A. No. 180 of 2000 stands dismissed. No costs.
