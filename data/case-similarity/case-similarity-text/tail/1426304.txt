appealable. Therefore, it can easily be interpreted that in either case it is
only an interim order and not an interim award. Analogy of British law on the
subject cannot be pressed into service because under the British Arbitration
Act such order has been specifically termed as award whereas in the Indian
Arbitration Act such order has not been so specifically termed.
11\. This decision is of no help to the respondents because by the impugned
order the learned arbitrator has decided a contentious issue between the
parties regarding the maintainability of the claim. This issue is not
concerned with the competence of the arbitral tribunal, therefore, the
impugned order cannot be placed in the category of orders passed under section
16(2) and 16(3) of the Act. It negates the plea of a legal infirmity
attributed to the claim itself. It is, therefore, not an interim order but an
interim award which can be challenged under Section 34 of the Act.
12\. In view of my discussion above, I hold that the impugned order is in the
nature of interim award which can be challenged under section 34 of the Act.
Therefore, this petition is maintainable. On merits, the view taken by learned
arbitral tribunal that Section 69 of Partnership Act has no application to the
proceedings before the arbitral tribunal is legally sound and calls for no
interference.
13\. In the result this petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
