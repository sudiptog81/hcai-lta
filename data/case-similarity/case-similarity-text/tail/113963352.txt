loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. Jagannath was working as
a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction
on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the
registered release deed (Exhibit B-1S) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding
the property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total
decretal amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these
facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that
he had purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal
Sowcar. Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the
trial tantamounts to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the
observations of the High Court that the appellants-defendants could have
easily produced the certified registered copy of Exhibit B-15 and non-suited
the plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all
the documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
he would he guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite
party.
9\. We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the
High Court and restore that of the trial court. The appellants shall be
entitled to their costs which we quantify as Rs. 11,000.
