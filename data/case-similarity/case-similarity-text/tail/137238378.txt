pointed out by the respondents herein. A public advertisement was also issued
dated 20th January 2012 in 'Sandesh' daily. Ultimately, the Charity
Commissioner, being satisfied as regards the need to frame a scheme, proceeded
to allow the application. The appellants herein, being dissatisfied with the
order passed by the Charity Commissioner, appealed before the City Civil
Court. The City Civil Court also looked into all the relevant aspects of the
matter and ultimately thought fit to affirm the order passed by the Charity
Commissioner framing the scheme.
25\. In such circumstances referred to above and more particularly having
regard to the scope of the present appeal as discussed above, I see no good
reason to disturb the order passed by the City Civil Court affirming the
scheme framed by the Charity Commissioner. The findings recorded by the court
below cannot be termed as perverse. There is no jurisdictional error or
infirmity in the order, warranting any interference in the present Appeal.

26\. In the result, this Appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. As the First
Appeal has been dismissed, the connected Civil Application would not survive
and the same is disposed of accordingly.
