could be said that he had reason to believe that income of the company had
been underassessed by reason of failure on the part of the company to disclose
fully and truly all material facts relating to the assessment and if, on those
materials, the Income Tax Officer could hold the belief which he says he did,
the court in seeking to hold an enquiry into the question whether the Income
Tax Officer, notwithstanding his affidavit and materials placed in support
thereof, had reason to hold the requisite belief, would be arrogating to
itself jurisdiction which it does not possess. If the conditions precedent do
not exist, the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue high prerogative, writs
under Art. 226 of the Constitution to prohibit action under the notice may be
exercised. But if the existence of the conditions is asserted by the authority
entrusted with the power and the materials on the record prima facie Support
the existence of such conditions, an enquiry whether the authority could not
have reasonably held the belief which he says he had reason to hold and he did
hold, is, in my judgment, barred.
In that view, the proper order to pass in this appeal would be one of
dismissal with costs.
BY COURT.-In view of the majority opinion, the appeal is allowed with costs
here and below.
