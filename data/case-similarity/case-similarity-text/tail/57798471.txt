But keeping in view the fact that the life of the patent in favour of Roche in
India would expire in March, 2016 we do not grant the injunction as prayed for
by Roche against Cipla (because as noted above there was no interim injunction
in favour of Roche and due to said reason Cipla continued to manufacture and
sell Erlocip). We decree that Cipla would be liable to render accounts
concerning manufacture and sale of Erlocip, for which purpose suit filed by
Roche against Cipla is restored with  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 & 103/2012 Page 105
of 106 direction that it be listed before the learned Joint Registrar who
would record evidence pertaining to the profits made by Cipla concerning the
offending product. Thereafter the report of the learned Joint Registrar shall
be placed before the learned Single Judge as per roster for appropriate
orders. RFA (OS) No.103/2012 is dismissed. RFA (OS) No.92/2012 is partially
allowed as above.
184\. Costs allowed in favour of Roche and against Cipla in sum of `5,00,000/-
(Rupees Five Lakhs only).
