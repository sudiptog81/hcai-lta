criminal prosecution to 935 continue, the court may while taking into
consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even
though it may be at a preliminary stage.
Mr. Jethmalani has submitted, as we have already noted, that a case of breach
of trust is both a civil wrong and a criminal offence. There would be certain
situations where it would predominantly be a civil wrong and may or may not
amount to a criminal offence. We are of the view that this case is one of that
type where, if at all, the facts may constitute a civil wrong and the
ingredients of the criminal offences are wanting. Several decisions were cited
before us in support of the respective stands taken by counsel for the
parties. It is unnecessary to refer to them. In course of hearing of the
appeals, Dr. Singhvi made it clear that Madhavi does not claim any interest in
the tenancy. In the setting of the matter we are inclined to hold that the
criminal case should not be continued.
Criminal Appeal No. 657 of 1986 is allowed and the criminal prosecution
against the two appellants being Madhavrao and Russi Homi Avari is quashed. In
view of what we have stated above, Criminal Appeal No. 658 of 1986 has to fail
and is dismissed.
    N.P.V.					   Appeal dismissed.
