by side with the normal excise duties. The clear intention is that the same
provisions shall govern both the levies except that the duty under the later
Act is confined to certain goods only and its distributability among the
States may perhaps follow a different pattern from the principal duty. There
is no reason or logic why all the incidents attaching under the earlier
legislation, in so &r as they are not clearly inconsistent with the later one
should not be extended to the later legislation as well. As has been pointed
out earlier, the Finance Acts which levied special or regular or additional
excise duties contained in themselves all the elements of charge of duty. The
goods were mentioned and the duty as to be levied either at a percentage of
the normal excise duty payable under the 1944 Act or at a percentage of the
value of the assessable goods as determined under the 1944 Act. All that was
further needed was the applicability of the procedural provisions of the 1944
Act Here, however, the 1957 Act is incomplete as to the basis of the charge
and its provisions would become totally unworkable unless the concepts of
"manufacture" and "assessable value?' as determined under the 1944 Act are
carried into it. In the circumstances, I agree that we should give full and
literal effect to the language of s. 3(3) and hold that it has the effect not
only of attracting the procedural provisions of the 1944 Act but also all its
other provisions, including those Containing the definition. M.L.A.
