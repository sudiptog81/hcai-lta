injunction restraining O.M.M. Private Limited from entering into a transaction
for mining and lifting of the ore with any other individual or concern making
it clear that it can, on its own, carry on the mining operations in terms of
the mining lease.
25\. We think that the arbitration proceedings must be expedited. We are told
that the application for appointment of an arbitrator made before the Chief
Justice of the Orissa High Court under Section 11(6) of the Act is pending for
over two years without orders. Normally, we would have requested the Chief
Justice of the Orissa High Court or his nominee to take up and dispose of the
application under Section 11(6) of the Act expeditiously. But we put it to the
parties that it would be more expedient if we appoint an arbitrator in this
proceeding itself, so that further delay can be avoided. The parties have
agreed to that course. We therefore think that it would be in the interests of
justice if we appoint here and now a sole arbitrator to adjudicate on the
dispute between the parties. Hence we appoint Mr. Justice R.C. Lahoti, former
Chief Justice of India as the sole arbitrator to decide the dispute between
the parties. The arbitrator will be free to fix his terms in consultation with
the parties. We confidently expect the sole arbitrator to enter upon the
reference and pronounce his award expeditiously.
26\. The appeals are disposed of as above. We make no order as to costs.
