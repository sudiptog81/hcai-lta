bar a contention as regards the right to challenge an appointment upon due
participation at the interview/selection. It is a remedy which stands barred
and it is in this perspective in Om Prakash Shukla (Om Prakash Shukla v.
Akhilesh Kumar Shukla and Ors. , a three Judge Bench of this Court laid down
in no uncertain terms that when a candidate appears at the examination without
protest and subsequently found to be not successful in the examination,
question of entertaining a petition challenging the said examination would not
arise."
It was further observed :
"34. There is thus no doubt that while question of any estoppel by conduct
would not arise in the contextual facts but the law seem to be well settled
that in the event a candidate appears at the interview and participates
therein, only because the result of the interview is not 'palatable' to him,
he cannot turn round and subsequently contend that the process of interview
was unfair or there was some lacuna in the process."
20\. We are, however, not oblivious that there are certain exceptions to the
aforementioned rules but we are not concerned therewith in the present case.
21\. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be
sustained, which is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed. However, in
the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
