Order No. 147/2000-A dated 22.12.2000 are challenged.
By order dated 18.2.2000, the Tribunal held that the clearances of the goods
were effected pursuant to the approved classification list and price list and
that being the position, the entire exercise undertaken by the department in
pursuance of the show-cause notice dated 31.3.1986 was illegal. The Tribunal,
therefore, set aside the order passed by the adjudicating authority and the
department was directed to refund the amount expeditiously. That order was
challenged by filing applications to rectify the mistakes on the ground of
subsequent amendment of the statute. The Tribunal dismissed those applications
relying upon the Cotspun's case and held that the subsequent amendment of
statute cannot be a reason for entertaining a petition for rectification of a
mistake.
In view of the interpretation rendered by us with regard to statutory
provisions, these appeals are required to be allowed and the matters are
required to be remitted to the Tribunal for deciding it on merits with regard
to the other contention which are sought to be raised on facts.
In the result, appeals are allowed accordingly and the orders of CEGAT are set
aside. The matters are remitted to the Tribunal for deciding the same on
merits in accordance with law.
There shall be no order as to costs in all these appeals.
