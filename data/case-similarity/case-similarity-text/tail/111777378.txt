intention of the parties to an agreement quite clear and it is not advisable
to read such a clause in the agreement like a statute. In the present case,
only the Courts in Kolkata had jurisdiction to entertain the disputes between
the parties."
Therefore, we are of the opinion that the Courts of Mumbai were granted
exclusive jurisdiction as per the Agreement and we find no reason to create
any exception to the intention of the parties.
In view of the above-mentioned two findings that the present suit is a suit
for land, and that the parties had granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Court
of Mumbai, the jurisdiction of the Court at Calcutta is clearly ousted as per
law. Thus, from the above conclusion it appears that the plaint will have to
be returned by the Calcutta High Court as it does not have the jurisdiction.
Therefore, we are of the view that the question of jurisdiction of the Debt
Recovery Tribunal need not be answered. Consequently, this appeal is
dismissed. The parties may proceed to take any appropriate measure in an
appropriate forum as provided in law to enforce their rights.
