38\. We are afraid none of the decisions cited by the learned senior Counsel
for the appellant has any application to the facts of the present case. The
courts below have concurrently held that the arbitrator has gone into the
issues of facts thoroughly, applied his mind to the pleadings, evidence before
him and the terms of the contract and then passed duly considered award and no
ground for setting aside the award within the four corners of Section 30 has
been made out. We have no justifiable reason to take a different view. As
noticed above, only two grounds were urged before the High Court in assailing
the award, one of which relating to time barred claim was ultimately notessed
before us and the only argument survived for consideration before us related
to clause 7.2 of the contract. In what we have already discussed above, the
view of the arbitrator in this regard is a possible view.
39\. Consequently, appeal has no merit and must fail. The same is dismissed
with no order as to costs.
