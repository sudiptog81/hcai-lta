foreign technical director, only that portion of the amount which is exempt
under s. 10(6)(viia) of the Act should also not be taken into consideration
for applying the ceiling under s. 40(c) of the Act. It cannot be on the entire
salary, remuneration or perquisite paid to the foreign director as the Central
Government has not applied its mind to the entire salary that was paid to the
foreign technician. The reasonable construction of s. 40A(5)(b) would be to
limit the allowance to the extent to which the exemption was granted by the
Central Government. Therefore, the Tribunal was correct in holding that in
determining the quantum of remuneration, it cannot be on total remuneration,
but the remuneration to which the remuneration was exempt under s. 10(6)(viia)
of the Act.
