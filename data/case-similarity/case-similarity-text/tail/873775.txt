marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other (whether any such
trade mark is already registered or not) in respect of the same goods or
description of goods, subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, as
the Registrar may think fit to impose.
(51) So long as there is no concurrent user or any other special circumstance
in respect of the same goods or description of goods, the Registrar could not
think it fit to impose any conditions or limitations. The Assistant Registrar
however could limit the registration in respect of locks and only in view of
the stand taken by the applicant himself.
(52) While one could not be oblivious to the expansionist approach of every
trader whether it is of the opponents or that of the applicant, the Registrar
of Trade Marks is not supposed to be swayed by these expansionist and extreme
approaches. Small fishes have a right to survive despite the existence of the
big fishes in the trade of different kinds.
(53) For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed and the Registrar of
Trade Marks is directed to register the trade mark of the petitioner limiting
the registration in respect of locks only for sale in the States of Uttar
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Mysore.
(54) In the peculiar circumstances of the case, parties are lift to bear their
own costs.
