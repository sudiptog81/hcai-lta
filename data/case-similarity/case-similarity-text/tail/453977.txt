have disentitled them from invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under
Article 136 of the Constitution. Since we are of the view that the appellants
cannot succeed on the merits, we do not propose to dismiss the appeals on this
preliminary ground.
In the result the appeals and the writ petition are dismissed. There will be
no order as to costs. The appellants in Civil Appeals Nos. 2368 and 2369 of
1986 had been dispossessed from the premises in their occu- pation after the
dismissal of their appeals by the Addition- al District Judge. During the
pendency of these appeals interim orders were passed by this Court whereunder
posses- sion of a part of the premises was restored to the appel- lants. Since
these appeals have been dismissed the appel- lants in both the appeals are
directed to handover the possession of the portion of the premises in their
occupa- tion to the Respondent Bank within one month. In Civil Appeal No. 3725
of 1986 and Writ Petition No. 864 of 1985, this Court had passed interim
orders staying the eviction of the petitioners in those matters. Since the
appeal and the writ petition are being dismissed the said interim orders shall
stand vacated.
