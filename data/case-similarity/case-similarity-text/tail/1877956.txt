the exemption relating to purchase tax and confined the exemption from sales
tax to the limit specified in the proviso of the Notification. All parties
before us who in response to the Order of April 11, 1979 set up their
industries prior to 21.10.1980 within the State of Kerala would thus-be
entitled to the exemption 660 extended and/or promised under that Order. Such
exemption would continue for the full period of five years from the date they
started production. New industries set up after 21.10. 1980 obviously would
not be ,entitled to that benefit as they had noticed of the curtailment in the
exemption before they came to set up their industries. In the course of
hearing and in the written submissions furnished on behalf of the State it was
contended that the question as to which of the appellants are entitled to the
benefit should be left to the Sales Tax Authorities to decide. We are of the
view that once the law is settled, that part of the decision may be left to
the Departmental authorities and they may decide the question on merits in
appropriate proceeding in accordance with the law laid down in this judgment.
Each of the appeals is allowed. Parties are directed to bear their own costs
throughout.
    P.S.S.						      Appeal
