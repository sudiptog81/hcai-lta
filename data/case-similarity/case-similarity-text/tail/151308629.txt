trial of the present suit and we find no reason as to why damages should not
afford an adequate remedy, assuming that the appellants ultimately succeed in
the suit.
We hasten to add that resolution of the other issues raised by respective
counsel for the parties as to whether 'Glucose-D' is a generic term or can be
used as a trade mark or whether the first respondent is entitled to protection
under Section 35 of the Trade Marks Act, as well as related issues would come
for consideration in the suit itself and hence no observation in respect
thereof is required to be made while deciding the present appeal.
It is settled law that in appellate proceedings from the grant or refusal of
interim relief, the Court of Appeal is called upon to consider the correctness
or otherwise of a decision which essentially is an exercise of judicial
discretion and that it may not interfere where the decision impugned is not
wrong in principle or does not suffer from glaring errors causing miscarriage
of justice. We have been unable to find any such defect in the order of the
learned Judge.
The appeal stands dismissed with costs assessed at 3000 GMs. Urgent photostat
certified copy of this order, if applied for, be furnished to the applicant
within 4 days from date of putting in requisites therefor. I agree.
