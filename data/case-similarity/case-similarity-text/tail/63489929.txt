caste-based reservation? It is not invalid because it fails to set a time-
limit. See para 272.
10) At what point is a student no longer Educationally Backward and thus no
longer eligible for special provisions under 15(5)?
Once a candidate graduates from a university, the said candidate is
educationally forward and is ineligible for special benefits under Article
15(5) of the Constitution for post graduate and any further studies
thereafter. See para 273.
11\. Would it be reasonable to balance OBC reservation with societal interests
by instituting OBC cut-off marks that are slightly lower than that of the
general category?
It is reasonable to balance reservation with other societal interests. To
maintain standards of excellence, cut off marks for OBCs should be set not
more than 10 marks out of 100 below that of the general category.
See paras 274-278.
These Writ Petitions and Contempt Petition are accordingly disposed of. In the
facts and circumstances, the parties are to bear their own costs.
