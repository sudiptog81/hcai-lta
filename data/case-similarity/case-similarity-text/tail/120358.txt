In Writ Petition No. 202 of 1966, it was contended by Mr. Nambyar that the
continuance of the Proclamation of Emergency under Art. 352 of the
Constitution was a gross violation of power because the emergency had ceased
to exist. It was also contended that Art. 358 should be so construed as to
confine its operation on to legislative or executive action relevant to the
Proclamation of Emergency. It was submitted that the Mysore State was rot a
border area and the land reform legislation of that State had no relevant-
connection with the Proclamation of Emergency and the fundamental rights
conferred by Art. 19 cannot be suspended so far as the petitions are
concerned. I do not think that it is necessary to express any opinion on these
points because the Writ Petition must fail on the other grounds which I have
already discussed above. It is also not necessary for me to express an opinion
on the doctrine of prospective overruling of legislation. For the reasons
already expressed I hold that all these petitions fail and should be
dismissed, but there will be no order as to Petitions dismissed.
