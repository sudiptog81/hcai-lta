circumstances it has overruled the reasons on cogent grounds.
21\. It was argued by Mr. Sen that this was clearly a case where another view
on the evidence was possible and. therefore, the order of acquittal passed by
the learned Sessions Judge ought not to have been disturbed. On going through
the evidence and considering the circumstances in the present case and in the
light of the arguments advanced before us, we are fully satisfied that this is
not a case in which another reasonable view could be possible. On the other
hand we feel that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge was manifestly
perverse and wholly unreasonable and was largely based on pure speculation,
surmises and conjectures. Most of the reasons which the learned Sessions Judge
gave for rejecting the prosecution case were not only against the weight of
the evidence, but also illusory and artificial as pointed out by the High
Court We feel that on a proper appreciation of the evidence led by the
prosecution case in this case, the only view which is possible is the one
which has ' been taken by the High Court. We, therefore, find ourselves in
complete agreement with the judgment of the High Court and hold that the High
Court was fully justified in reversing the order of acquittal passed by the
learned Sessions Judge.
22\. For the reasons given above, the conviction and sentences passed on the
appellant are affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.
