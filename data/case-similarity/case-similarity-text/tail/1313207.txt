    was  made of all disputes between the parties in  the  suit,
    the  occasion to make a counter-claim in the written  state-
    ment  could  arise only after the order	 of  reference.	 The
    pleadings  of the parties were filed before the	 arbitrator,
    and  the reference covered all disputes between the  parties
    in the suit. Accordingly, the counterclaim could not be made
    at any earlier stage. Refusal to consider the  counter-claim
    disclosed an error of law apparent on the face of the award.
