This leads us to the last contention that in the absence of any allegation in
the first information report in the two cases about the disturbance of public
order the detaining authority could not invent a ground regarding the
apprehension from the petitioners about the disturbance of public order. A
counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the detaining authority and in
paragraph 3 it has been averred that apart from the first information report
in the two cases there was the supervision note of the Deputy Superintendent
of Police, Dhanbad and the detaining authority was satisfied on the basis of
materials before him that there was apprehension of breach of public order
from the petitioners. The absence of an allegation about the disturbance of
public order in the two first information reports will not effect the position
because there was additional material before the detaining authority which
satisfied him about the apprehension of breach of public order from the
petitioners in case they were enlarged on bail. This contention has, therefore
no substance.
For the foregoing discussion we find no force in any of the contentions and
the petitions must fail. They are accordingly dismissed.
    S.R.					Petitions dismissed.
