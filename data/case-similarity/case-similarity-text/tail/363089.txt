was of supervisory nature and that the employees under him were bound to carry
out his orders. Again, he did not state that he himself, as successor of
Gupta, had any powers at all to give instructions to the Junior clerks an to
the actual manner is which they were to perform their duties and to carry on
their work. He also did not state that he was required to scrutinize the work
done by them in order to ensure that it was being properly carried out.
7\. On these facts, we are unable to hold that the labour court committed any
error is arriving at the decision that Gupta was employed on clerical work and
not in supervisory capacity. The principal work that Gupta was doing was that
of maintaining and writing the cash book and of preparing various returns.
Being the senior most clerk, he was put in charge of the provident fund
section and was given a small amount of control over the other clerks working
in his section. The only powers he could exercise over them was to allocate
work between them to permit them to leave during office hours, and to
recommend their leave applications. These few minor duties of a supervisory
nature cannot, in our opinion, convert his office of senior clerk in charge
into that of a supervisor. The labour court was, therefore, right in holding
that Gupta was a workman on the date of his retirement and that an industrial
dispute did, in fact, exist.
8\. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
