conducting it as to how to conduct the investigation. When that is the
position of law, Mr. Justice M.K. Chawla, in our considered view, has
overstepped his jurisdiction and made the statement which is unwarranted and
uncalled for. As we feel that any further deliberation on this matter may
affect the merits of the case at any later point of time, we refrain from
making any more observation on this aspect as the matter is at the threshold
of the investigation.
163\. Therefore, we are constrained to set aside that statement, holding that
the opinion of Justice Chawla in this regard has no legal effect or
consequence. So far as the rest of the alleged illegalities are concerned, we
straightaway say that those grounds are not available for suo moto exercise of
power in the light of the well settled legal principles enunciated by this
Court for the exercise of such powers.
164\. In the result, we reiterate our earlier conclusion that we agree with
the first part of the order dated 19.12.1990 of Mr. Justice M.K. Chawla but
quash the later part of the impugned order taking suo moto congnizance under
Sections 397, 401 read with 482 of the Code issuing show-cause notice to the
CBI and the State. We make it clear that we do not express any opinion on the
merits of the case including the legal tenability of the illegalities opined
by Mr. Justice M.K. Chawla in bis impugned order.
