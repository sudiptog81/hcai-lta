“42. The words “as if” demonstrate that award and decree or order are two
different things. The legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of
enforcement as a decree. The fiction is not intended to make it a decree for
all purposes under all statutes, whether State or Central.” Though the learned
senior counsel for the appellant and the respondent referred to certain other
decisions in support of their respective submissions, as we are fortified by
our conclusion, based on the interpretation of Section 69 of the Partnership
Act vis-à-vis the 1996 Act and the 1940 Act as well as supported by the
decision in Jagdish Chander (supra) and Kamal Pushp Enterprises (supra), we do
not find any necessity to refer to those decisions in detail. Having regard to
our conclusion that Arbitral Proceedings will not come under the expression
“other proceedings” of Section 69(3) of the Partnership Act, the ban imposed
under the said Section 69 can have no application to Arbitral proceedings as
well as the Arbitration Award. Therefore, the appeal stands allowed, the
impugned judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and the judgment of the
learned Single Judge stands restored. No costs.
