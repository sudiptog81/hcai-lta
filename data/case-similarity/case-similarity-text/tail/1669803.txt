Shaik Hanif, W. P. Nos. 1679 etc., of 1973, D/- 1-2-1974, reported in AIR 1974
SC 679. We emphasis the facts we are dealing with are rather peculiar;
otherwise the rule in Shaik Hanif would have governed it .
9\. The petition, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. However the fact:
remains that the petitioner was arrested in September 1972, and has been in
deterrent incarceration for nearly a year and half. Prolonged imprisonment
without trial alienates the individual against society and makes him a
vengeful enemy when he ultimately emerges from the prison cell. Indeed, it is
a serious injury inflicted on an individual by the State which can be
justified as a measure of social defence only in extreme circumstances. But to
jail a man on subjective satisfaction of possible prejudicial activity and to
forget about him altar the statutory formalities have been performed is not
fair to the Constitutional guarantees. It is appropriate for & democratic
government not merely to confine preventive detention to serious cases but
also to review periodically the need for the continuance of the Incarceration.
The rule of law and public conscience must be respected to the maxi mum extent
risk-taking permits, and we dismiss the present petition with the hopeful
thought that the petitioner and others like him will not languish in prison
cells for a day longest than the administrator drinks is absolutely necessary
for the critical safety of society.
