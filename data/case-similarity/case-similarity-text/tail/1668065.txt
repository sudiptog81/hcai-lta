81\. As a result of frequent interference by Hon'ble High Court either under
Article 226 or 227 of the  5 Constitution with pending civil and at times
criminal cases, the disposal of cases by the civil and criminal courts gets
further impeded and thus causing serious problems in the administration of
justice.
82\. This Court hopes and trusts that in exercising its power either under
Article 226 or 227, Hon'ble High Court will follow the time honoured
principles discussed above. Those principles have been formulated by this
Court for ends of justice and the High Courts as the highest Courts of justice
within their jurisdiction will adhere to them strictly.
83\. For the reasons aforesaid, it is held that the High Court committed an
error in entertaining the writ petition in a dispute between landlord and
tenant and where the only respondent is a private landlord. The course adopted
by the High Court cannot be approved. Of course, High Court's order of non-
interference in view of concurrent findings of facts is unexceptionable.
Consequently, the appeal is dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to
costs.
