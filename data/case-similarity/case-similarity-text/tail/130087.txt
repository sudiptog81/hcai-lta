full stop ( punctuation marks) are comparable. In a good number of entries
spelling mistakes occurring in the plaintiff's data are to be found in the
data compilation of the defendant as well. These provide an intrinsic
irrebuttable circumstantial evidence of defendant having indulged into slavish
imitation of plaintiff's compilation, making out a clear case of infringement
of copyright. The database available with the defendant is substantially a
copy of the database available with the plaintiff and compiled by him. The
striking similarities noticed in the two databases could not have existed but
for the fact of the defendant having made use of plaintiff's database. A
strong prima facie case of infringement by the defendant of the plaintiff's
copyright has been made out to the satisfaction of the court.
(14) If the defendant is permitted to make use of the plaintiff's database, it
is sure to cause an injury to the plaintiff which would be incapable of being
estimated in terms of money. The balance of convenience is also in favor of
the plaintiff.
(15) For the foregoing reasons the application filed by the plaintiff is
allowed. The defendant shall remain restrained during pendency of the suit
from carrying on any business including mail order business by utilising the
list of clientele/customers included in the database exclusively owned by the
plaintiff.
