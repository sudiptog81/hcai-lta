that as per the plaintiff also, there was no fixed term for which either of
the defendants no.1 to 8 had agreed to serve the plaintiff. The clause in the
Employment Contract claimed by the plaintiff also is to the effect that
CS(COMM) No.735/2016 Page 31 of 32 defendants no.1 to 8, for a period of one
year after ceasing to be the employee of the plaintiff, to not compete with
the plaintiff. Such a clause in the Employment Contract, as per the judgments
aforesaid of the Supreme Court, is void under Section 27 of the Contract Act.
Once the clause is void, there can be no injunction or damages in lieu of
injunction on the basis thereof.

premise of non-compete clause thus discloses no cause of action and is not
required to be put to trial.

disclose the plaintiff to be entitled to the reliefs of injunction or damages
and is thus liable to be rejected and is rejected and the suit is dismissed.
Decree sheet be drawn.
However, no costs.
