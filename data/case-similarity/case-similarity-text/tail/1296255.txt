the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the
circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion.- But whether the intention is
there or not is one of fact and not one of law. Whether the wound is serious
or otherwise, and if serious, how serious, is a totally separate and distinct
question and has nothing to do with the question whether the prisoner intended
to inflict the injury in question. It is true that in a given case the enquiry
may be linked up with the seriousness of the injury. For example, if it can be
proved, or if the totality of the circumstances justify an inference, that the
prisoner only intended a superficial scratch and that by accident his victim
stumbled and fell on the sword or spear that was used, then of course the
offence is not murder. But that is not because the prisoner did not intend the
injury that he intended to inflict to be as serious as it turned out to be but
because he did not intend to inflict the injury in question at all. His
intention in such a case would be to inflict a totally different injury. The
difference is not One of law but 1504 one of fact; and whether the conclusion
should be one way or the other is a matter of proof, where necessary, by
calling in aid all reasonable inferences of fact in the absence of direct
testimony. It is not one for guess-work and fanciful conjecture.
The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
