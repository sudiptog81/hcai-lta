4\. Section 11A empowers the Department to re-open proceedings if the levy has
been short-levied or not levied within six months from the relevant date. But
the proviso carves out an exception and permits the authority to exercise this
power within five years from the relevant date in the circumstances mentioned
in the proviso, one of it being suppression of facts. The meaning of the word
both in law and even otherwise is well known. In normal understanding it is
not different that what is explained in various dictionaries unless of course
the context in which it has been used indicates otherwise. A perusal of the
proviso indicates that it has been used in company of such strong words as
fraud, collusion or wilful default. In fact it is the mildest expression used
in the proviso. Yet the surroundings in which it has been used it has to be
construed strictly. It does not mean any omission. The act must be deliberate.
In taxation, it can have only one meaning that the correct information was not
disclosed deliberately to escape from payment of duty. Where facts are known
to both the parties the omission by one to do what he might have done and not
that he must have done, does not render it suppression.
5\. In the result this appeal succeeds and is allowed. The matter is remitted
back to the Authority for determining the turnover of the assessee in respect
of only that period which is within six months from the date of issue of show
cause notice.
