shall have no objection to the supply of copies of all the relevant documents
and statements on which the prosecution intends to rely, to the accused-
appellants in the trial court. In view of this undertaking we thought it
unnecessary to go into the legal aspects of this question. We will however,
add that the prosecution shall also permit the accused-appellant to inspect
the other material that may have been collected by the inquiry officer,
relevant to the charge against the accused-appellant. With this observation,
we would dismiss these appeals (Nos. 208-209 of 1974) and send the case back
to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law. Since the
case is already old, the proceedings shall be conducted as far as possible,
from day-to-day on top-priority basis, and disposed of preferably within three
months of the date or which the records are received in the trial court.
Since the legal questions raised before us in Special Leave Petition (Crl.)
No. 630 of 1977 are the same as in Criminal Appeals Nos. 208-209 of 1974, and
the learned counsel for the petitioners therein has adopted the arguments of
Shri R.K. Garg, appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeals Nos. 208-209
of 1974, that Special Leave Petition, after granting special leave to appeal,
will also stand disposed of by this judgment.
N.V.K. Appeals dismissed.
