> may if he considers it advisable, retain the deposits of any bidders".
There is nothing in the above clause to indicate that any right over or in the
security deposits was created in favour of the State Government.
In Reference under Stamp Act, section 46(1) where a licence issued to an
arrack renter expressly required as one of its conditions that the licensee
should deposit a sum equal to three months' rental as a security for the due
performance of the contract and the licensee executed a muchalka stating that
he agreed to all the terms and conditions mentioned in the licence, it was
held that neither the licence nor the muchalka taken separately or together
fulfilled the conditions of a mortgage as defined in the Stamp Act i.e.,
neither thereby actually created an interest in the deposit in favour of the
Government.
In Rishidev Sondhi v. Dhampur Sugar Mills it was held that an instrument in
which specific sums have been offered as security is not a mortgage deed
within the meaning of section 2(17) as money is not `specified property'.
In view of the above we have no manner of doubt that the respondents could not
be called upon to pay the stamp duty under Article 35(c) of the Stamp Act.
In the result the appeals fail and are hereby dismissed with costs.
    P.B.R.					  Appeals dismissed.
