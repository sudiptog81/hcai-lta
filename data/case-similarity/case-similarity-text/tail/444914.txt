the complainant was serious about the same, it could have produced the pattern
which was reproduced on the glass-sheet in the United Kingdom and the pattern
which is reproduced on the glass-sheet by the rollers of the design produced
before us. If these two glass-sheets were placed before learned Single Judge
or before us we would have been able to record the finding. The finding
recorded by the Assistant Controller is most inconclusive and it does not give
us any assurance that it was a proper comparison of the two patters by the
Assistant Controller. Learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court had
occasion to go through both the patterns and found that there is no
comparison. Likewise, the glass-sheets were placed before us with all
dimensions along with a copy of the print out of the United Kingdom and we are
of opinion that there is no comparison between the two. From the visual appeal
placed before us, learned Single Judge has rightly concluded that there is no
comparison of pattern or configuration of two designs. We fully agree with the
view taken by learned Single Judge. Hence on this count also the view taken by
the Assistant Controller does not appear to be correct and the view taken by
learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court is correct.
15\. As a result of our above discussion, we do not find any merit in this
appeal and the same is dismissed with costs of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty
thousand only).
