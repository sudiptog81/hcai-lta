Thiru.Vi.Ka.Industrial Estate to carry on business in respect of WIPRO
Ayurvedic Soap. While number of offices of WIPRO Limited are located in and
around Chennai, in the absence of acceptable evidence, it cannot be held that
Thiru.Vi.Ka.Industrial Estate is the Branch Office associated with the
business in respect of CHANDRIKA Ayurvedic Soap."
18\. In our opinion, the learned single Judge is clearly in error in going
beyond the statements contained in the plaint. It has been repeatedly held by
the Supreme Court that for the purpose of deciding an application under
clauses (a) and (b) of Order VII Rule 11 of the C.P.C, the averments made in
the plaint are germane; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written
statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage. ( See O.N.Bhatnagar v.
Rukibai Narsindas, 1982 (2) SCC 244; Roop Lal Sathi v. Nachhattar Singh Gill,
1982(3) SCC 487 & Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Asst.Charity Commr., 2004 (3) SCC
137).
19\. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeals are allowed. The suits
are restored to file. Ad interim injunction granted on 4.1.2007 stands
revived. The matter is remitted back to the learned single Judge to consider
the applications for interim injunction on merits. Consequently, M.P. Nos.1,
1, 1 and 1 of 2008 in the respective appeals are closed.
