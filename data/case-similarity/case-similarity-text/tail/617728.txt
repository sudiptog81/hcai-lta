in ACER India Ltd. (supra) has no application to the facts of the present
case. Further, in the case of ACER India Ltd. (supra), the subject-matter of
the levy was a computer whereas the subject-matter of the levy in the present
case is STD-PCO unit. The concurrent finding of all the courts below indicate
that, in the present case, the programme was etched in a particular form of
circuit known as ROM which is required to be fixed to the mother board and
only on such fitment the STD-PCO unit became operational. Therefore, the
judgment of this Court in ACER India Ltd. (supra) has no application to the
facts of the present case. In fact, in the judgment of this Court in ACER
India Ltd. (supra) the Court was not required to examine the scope of CH
85.42.
Before concluding, we reiterate that in the present case, the levy is on a
computer based embedded system. The software embedded in the programmed EPROM,
which is an IC chip, constitutes the "brain" of the system. The programmed
EPROM is an integral part of the system. The levy is on the unit. The levy is
not on the programmed EPROM. The programme embedded is not an easily
removable. Hence, it will not fall in the category of recorded media under
tariff item 85.24 and remains an IC under tariff item 85.42.
For the aforestated reasons, we do not find any merit in this civil appeal
which is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
