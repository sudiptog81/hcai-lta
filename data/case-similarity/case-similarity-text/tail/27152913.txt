34\. Under these circumstances, considering the entire facts and law
applicable to the present, I am of the considered view that the defendants‟
use of the impugned trade mark „JENYA‟ in the course of the same trade and for
the same product is likely to cause confusion and deception and it is
deceptively similar with the registered trade mark of the plaintiff i.e. ZEGNA
which is also pronounced as ZEN-YAH and जेनिया registered in Hindi. Therefore,
the defendants are restrained from CS(OS) No.629/2011 Page No.18 of 19 using
the trade mark „JENYA‟ in respect of readymade garments, shirts, trousers and
any other similar goods as that of the plaintiff and the ex- parte ad-interim
order granted on 15.03.2011 is confirmed. However, the defendants shall be
entitled to use the trade mark "MENYA" in relation to these goods as no
objection has been raised by the plaintiff with regard to „MENYA‟. The
findings hereinabove shall have no bearing when the matter is considered after
trial.
The applications stand disposed of.
