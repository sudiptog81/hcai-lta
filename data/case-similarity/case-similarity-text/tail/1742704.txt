against it by by the Trial Court was not challenged by the plaintiffs by
filing an appeal. Grant of licence is a statutory function to be discharged by
the Municipal Corporation. The licence having already been issued by the
Municipal Corporation to the defendant no.1/appellant, the Trial Court rightly
observed that the plaintiffs were at liberty to approach the Municipal
Corporation and seek cancellation of licence or pray for withholding the
renewal thereof by making out a case for the grant of such relief within the
framework of the legal provisions governing the grant and renewal of such
licence. Needless to say, in the event of the plaintiffs being illegally or
unreasonably denied relief by the Municipal Corporation, they would be at
liberty to pursue the remedy of appeal or approach the superior authorities
within the framework of Punjab Municipal Corporation Act or such other remedy
as may be available to them in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court and
restored by the High Court against defendant No.1/appellant are set aside. The
suit filed by the plaintiffs/respondents against the defendant no.1/appellant
is directed to be dismissed. However, such dismissal shall not prejudice the
right of the plaintiffs/respondents to bring another action and seek an
appropriate relief by making out a case of actual injury or imminent danger.
No order as to the costs.
