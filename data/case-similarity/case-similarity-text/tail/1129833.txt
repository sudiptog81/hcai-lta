For the foregoing reasons we feel that the judgment of the High Court should
be set aside. We accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court and
dismiss the Writ Petition. The appellant and all other successful candidates
at the 1981 examination held in Kanpur shall be appointed in accordance with
the Rules. We further direct that they shall be given the 880 salary,
allowances, increments and seniority to which they would have been entitled
but for the judgment of the High Court. But they will not be entitled to any
salary and allowances for the period during which they have not actually
worked. We also make it clear that if in any other centre, selections and
appointments have been made on the basis of the 1969 Amending Rules they shall
remain undisturbed.
The order passed by the High Court in the connected writ petition No. 10224 of
1983 on its file is also set aside. Similarly the oder passed in writ petition
No.5073 of 1984 on the file of the High Court is also reversed. There shall be
a common order in these connected cases as directed in this appeal.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs. The High Court may take steps, if
it so desires, to promulgate a fresh set of Rules of recruitment for-the staff
in the subordinate courts early.
    A.P.J.					    Appeal allowed.
