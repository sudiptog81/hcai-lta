Consequently, this Court had held that the Letters Patent Appeal against the
decision of the learned single Judge did not lie. The same ratio applies to
the facts in this case. Leave of the learned single Judge was admittedly not
obtained for filing the appeal. Consequently, since the appeal of the learned
single Judge arises under the Act by virtue of the statutory conferment of
supervisory jurisdiction, by operation of earlier part of clause 15 of the
Letters Patent Act would vest in him. The Letters Patent Appeal would not lie
to the Division Bench unless the certificate of the learned single Judge has
been granted for leave to appeal. In that view, the appeal to the Division
Bench was incompetent and is accordingly set aside.
The appeal is allowed accordingly. No costs.
