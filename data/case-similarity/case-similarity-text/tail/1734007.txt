the attempt at plagiarism. If a reappraisal of the facts in the present case
had been open in this court, I am not sure that I would not have differed from
the view taken on the facts by the High Court, but as the matter stands, the
trial Court as well as the High Court have concurred in the finding that such
similarities as exist between the stage play "Hum Hindustani" and the film
"New Delhi" do not make out a case of infringement. The dissimilarities, in
their opinion, are so material that it is not possible to say that the
appellant's copyright has been infringed. This Court is extremely reluctant to
interfere with concurrent findings of fact reached by the Courts below and for
that reason I would allow the judgment under appeal to stand. In another, and
perhaps a clearer case, it may be necessary for this Court to interfere and
remove the impression which may have gained ground that the copyright
belonging to an author can be readily infringed by making immaterial changes,
introducing insubstantial differences and enlarging the scope of the original
theme so that a veil of apparent dissimilarity is thrown around the work now
produced. The court will look strictly at not only blatant examples of copying
but also at reprehensible attempts at colourable imitation.
The appeal is dismissed, but without any order as to costs.
    P.H.P.					   Appeal dismissed.
