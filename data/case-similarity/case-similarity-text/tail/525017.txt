therefore, for the Court to decide in this case whether the dispute which 'has
arisen is a dispute covered by Clause IS of the Articles. It clearly is so,
because it is undoubtedly a dispute arising out of or in relation to a
contract made subject to the rules and regulations of the Cotton Trade
Association. Now that clause refers to the arbitrator the whole question

what is the effect of the rejection based on an award as to quality. In truth

appeal without further argument, as it is obvious that in that case even the
reference in the narrative to the grounds of defence in the letters is absent,
and there is nothing but the bare statement that a certain sum was awarded. It
follows that in the first appeal the appeal must be allowed and the judgment
of the trial Judge restored; the appellants must have their costs here and in
the Courts below. The second appeal must be dismissed and the respondents will
have their costs.
