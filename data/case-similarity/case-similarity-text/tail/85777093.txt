Legislature keeping in view the socio- economic conditions in a country to
confer lesser or larger rights. This would not mean that the said country sits
in isolation.
58\. For our reasons hereinabove, we find in the cross- objections filed
pertaining to the view taken by the learned Single Judge with respect to live
performances. We have already discussed the same. The appeals and cross-
objections are accordingly dismissed and while so doing, we would place on
record our appreciation of the high quality arguments advanced by Shri
P.V.Kapur, learned senior counsel who appeared for IPRS FAO(OS)-423, 424 &
425/2011 Page 42 of 43 and Shri Neeraj Kishan Kaul, who opposed the debate set
in motion by the appellants; and needless to state the valuable assistance
provided to them by junior members of the Bar whose names we have noted while
recording representation by counsel in the memo of parties above. It indeed
were pleasurable moments to hear high quality arguments which kept us captive
for a number of days when learned counsel showed their legal forensic skills.
59\. The contentions urged in the appeal being plausible, it not being a case
of filing of appeal just because an appellate remedy is available, we refrain
from imposing any costs.
