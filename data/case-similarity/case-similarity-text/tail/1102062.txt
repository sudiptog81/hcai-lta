Ordinances. It must therefore, -be held that there is no substance in the
contention that the petitioner's detention originally made under the rule
under the Ordinance would not be deemed to have continued under the Act (LI of
1962). Equally clearly, there is no substance in the contention that the same
Order should have been repeated by the President after the enactment of the
Act. It would have been a sheer act of supererogation and the legal fiction
laid down in s.8 is meant to avoid such unnecessary duplication of the use of
the constitutional machinery. A proper construction of the provisions of s.48
of the Act, which has replaced the Ordinances aforesaid, read in the light of
the provisions of s.8 of the General Clauses Act 456 leaves no room for doubt
that the detention order passed against the petitioner was intended to be
continued even after the repeal of the Ordinances which were incorporated in
the Act (LI of 1962). That being so, the Order of the President must have the
effect of suspending the petitioner's right to move this Court for a writ of
habeas corpus under Art. 32 of the Constitution. After the petititioner had
been deprived, for the time being, of his right to move this Court, it is
manifest that he cannot raise any questions as regards the vires of the
Ordinances or of the Rules and Orders made thereunder. In the result, the
application is held to be not maintainable, and, is therefore, dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
