that the particular question was not considered and decided. We would,
however, like to add that if a tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to decide a
question, it is irrelevant that the question is of a complicated nature. AS
held by Gatne, J., Jankibai Prahaladrai v. Kashinath, , if a question falls
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Deputy or Assistant Charity
Commissioner, it is not open to him to refer the parties to the civil Court on
the ground that the question is complicated.
40\. For these reasons, our answer to the first question is in the negative.
41\. As regards questions 2 and 3, we are of the opinion that for determining
whether the bar under Section 80 of the Act arises, it is irrelevant whether
the person who wants to raise the particular question under Section 19. The
fact that such a person was a party to those proceedings may, perhaps, raise a
bar analogous to that of res judicata but we are not concerned with that
question and would prefer not to express any opinion thereon. The Civil Court
would, however, have the jurisdiction to decide the points mentioned in
question No.1, in the sense that Section 80 cannot operate as a bar to that
jurisdiction.
42\. The papers may be sent back to the learned Single Judge for disposal of
the appeal.
43\. Reference answered accordingly.
