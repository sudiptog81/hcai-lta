in Switzerland by the Swiss party. For such an agreement, the Swiss party
might prefer to get a lump sum to start with and a small payment periodically
or, it might prefer to get no "down" payment, but a larger share in the
profits. Normally, not knowing what the consequence might be later, a party
will prefer a larger "down" payment. That is the way in which most of these
agreements are worded. A substantial sum paid initially is followed by some
royalty. The point which requires emphasis is the fact that the foreign party
did not permit the information and know-how to be used by anyone else. It is,
therefore, a kind of license agreement and not a sale of the now-how. Viewed
from this angle, which is a different line of reasoning, it must be held that
the sum of 50,000. Swiss francs paid initially was really a method by which
the Swiss party got its consideration for giving the manufacturing right for
five years to the assessed. It was the payment for the license and not a
payment for the know-how. The know-how was communicated to the assessed-
company company as a part and parcel of the collaboration agreement. Without
the know-how, the agreement could not work. So, by this line of line of
reasoning also, it must be held that the amount is a revenue expenditure and
not a capital expenditure. The question referred to us is answered
accordingly. Due to the complexity of the case, the parties are left to bear
their own costs.
