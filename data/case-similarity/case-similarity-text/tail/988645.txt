4th December, 2003. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider
presently, whether sub-clause (b) of Clause 31 operates ad-infinitum and
therefore void.
20\. At one stage, Mr. Chhagla submitted that sub-clause (b) of Clause 31 was
applicable only during the period of the third year of the contract i.e. 30th
October, 2002 to 29th October, 2003 and was not applicable after 30th October,
2003. The contention is stated only to be rejected. As stated earlier, sub-
clause (b) of Clause 31 was a contingent contract which became operative only
on non renewal of the contract under sub-clause (a) of Clause 31.
21\. In the circumstances, prima facie case is made out by the petitioner.
Though the learned Counsel were heard for a period spanning over three
sittings. Mr. Chagle submitted that the respondent No. 1 wants to file an
affidavit in reply and therefore, the petition should not be disposed of
finally. Hence, only an ad interim relief is granted in terms of prayer Clause
(a). Petition is admitted. Let the petition be listed for final hearing two
weeks after the respondent No. 1 files an affidavit in reply.
Prayer of the learned Counsel for the respondent No. 1 for stay of this order
is rejected.
All concerned to act on a copy of this order duly authenticated by the
Associate.
