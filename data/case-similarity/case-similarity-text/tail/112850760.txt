affection and ill will, hatred and contempt and fear and recklessness. In
order to be a successful Judge these elements should be curbed and kept under
restraint and that is possible only by education, training, continued practice
and cultivation of a sense of humility and dedication to duty. These curbs can
neither be bought in the market nor injected into human system by the written
or unwritten laws. If these things are there even if any of the protective
measures provided by the Constitution and the laws go the independence of the
judiciary will not suffer. But with all these measures being there still a
Judge may not be independent. It is the inner strength of Judges alone that
can save the judiciary. The life of a Judge does not really call for great
acts of self- sacrifice; but it does insist upon small acts of self-denial
almost every day. The following sloka explains the true traits of men with
discretion which all Judges should possess :(Let men trained in ethics or
morality, insult or praise; let lakshmi (wealth) accumulate or vanish as she
likes; let death come today itself or at the end of a yuga (millennium), men
with discretion will not deflect from the path of rectitude.) 1269\. This is
only an ideal. It is difficult to attain it but every Judge should at least
endeavour to set his eyes on that goal.
1270\. In view of the majority decision, all the transferred cases and writ
petitions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
