inevitable result is that this appeal fails and will stand dismissed. However,
it is clarified that the State of Orissa will carry out the remaining exercise
pursuant to its order dated 29th June, 1997 at the earliest and will see to it
that Shri Jagadish Prasad Dash Committee constituted by it on 6.11.1998 also
completes its exercise in connection with the remaining area of 436.295
hectares out of 1261.476 hectares, after in the first instance granting leases
as per its order dated 29th June, 1997 in the reserved area of 419.18 hectares
out of 1261.476 hectares for mining of Chromite in favour of the four parties
i.e. the appellant and Respondents 3 to 7 in Sukinda valley of Jaipur
District.
It is obvious that the grant of mining leases to the extent of 50% to the
appellant and Respondents 3 to 7 as per Order of the Orissa Government dated
29th June, 1997 will remain binding between the parties. However, any
additional leases granted by the State of Orissa pursuant to the Report of
Shri Jagadish Prasad Dash Committee or even otherwise to the appellant and
Respondents 3 to 7 to meet wholly or partially their remaining 50 per cent of
assessed needs as per Central Governments order dated 17th August, 1995 will
be subject to the revisions, if any, by the aggrieved parties before the
Central Government in accordance with law.
There will be no order as to costs in the facts and circumstances of the case.
