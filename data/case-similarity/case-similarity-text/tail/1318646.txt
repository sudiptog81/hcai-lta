has affirmatively proved the passing of consideration for the mortgage and
that there are no circumstances which could throw any suspicion on the bona
fides of the transaction.
It had been argued on behalf of the appellant that his case had been seriously
prejudiced by the joint trial, so to say, of the issue relating to his
transaction with the one relating to the hypothecation bond dated August 30,
1924. It was also argued that the mortgage bond in question had been executed
and registered and given effect to beyond two years from the date of
adjudication and that therefore this transaction could not be brought within
the mischief of s. 35 of the Insolvency Regulation. In view of our findings on
the other and more direct and important issues it is not necessary to
pronounce upon these additional grounds urged on behalf of the appellant.
In view of our findings on the main issues in the case, the appeal must be
allowed, the judgments and 283 orders of the courts below annulling the
usufructuary mortgage bond in question set aside and the transaction held
binding on the estate of the insolvents. It follows that the lease back to the
mortgagors being a part of the same transaction is equally binding on the
estate of the insolvents. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout,
to come out of the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver who must pay
his own costs. Appeal allowed.
