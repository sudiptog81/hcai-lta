strong triable issues as explained in American Cyanamide v. Ethicon Ltd., 1975
(1) All E.R. 504, which principles have been reiterated by the Apex Court in
Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan Lever Ltd., . Looking at the
material on record, the plaintiffs have failed to establish a strong prima
facie case. That by itself would disentitle the plaintiffs to the reliefs
prayed for.
Even assuming otherwise, the material on record and the contentions advanced
would only show that what the plaintiffs are pleading by way of passing off
action/character merchandising as a future potential. Real likelihood of
damage or probability of damage has not been established. The defendants
commercial is meant to promote their product 'Tide'. In these circumstances,
to my mind, it is clear that the plaintiffs have not been able to satisfy, at
this stage, that the balance of convenience is in their favour and/or
irreparable injury would be caused to them, if the defendants are allowed to
air their T.V. commercial. At any rate, the plaintiffs can always by
compensated by way of damages if they succeed as it the plaintiffs' case
themselves, that the defendants are a financially sound Company.
15\. Considering the above, to my mind, no case is made out for the grant of
any relief and, consequently. Motion stands dismissed. In the circumstances of
the case, each party to bear their own costs.
