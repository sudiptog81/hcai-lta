Government had taken possession of the land. Once the possession of the land
is taken it is not open to the government to withdraw from the acquisition.
The very letter dated 24.2.1990 relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner
recites that 'before restoring the possession to the society the amount of
development charges will have to be returned back............. This shows
clearly that possession was taken over by the Housing Board. Indeed the very
tenor of the letter is, asking the Housing Board as to what development work
they had carried out on the land and how much expenditure they had incurred
thereon, which could not have been done unless the Board was in possession of
the land. The Housing Board was asked to send the full particulars of the
expenditure and not to carry on any further development works on that land.
Reading the letter as a whole, it cannot but be said that the possession of
the land was taken by the government and was also delivered to the Housing
Board. Since the possession of the land was taken, there could be no question
of withdrawing from the acquisition under section 48 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894\.
For the above reasons, the writ petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
    G.N.				   Appeals allowed.
    				 Petition dismissed.
