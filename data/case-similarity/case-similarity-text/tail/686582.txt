the exercise of its jurisdiction. The High Court was, therefore. entitled to
allow the revision and consequently the third and fourth contentions also
fail.
In the result we find no merit in the appeal and accord- ingly it will stand
dismissed. Mr. Sampath, learned counsel for the appellant made a request that
in the event of the appeal being dismissed, the appellant should be given
suffi- ciently long time to secure another godown and shift his stock of goods
to that place. Mr. Padmanabhan learned coun- sel for the respondents very
fairly stated that the respond- ents are agreeable to give time to the
appellant till 31.12.87 to vacate the leased portion. Accordingly we order
that in spite of the dismissal of the appeal the appellant will have time till
31.12.87 to vacate the ground floor premises in his occupation and deliver
peaceful and vacant possession to the respondents subject however to the
appel- lant filing an under-taking in the usual terms in this behalf within 4
weeks from today failing which the respond- ents will be entitled to recover
possession of the building forthwith. The parties will bear their respective
costs.
