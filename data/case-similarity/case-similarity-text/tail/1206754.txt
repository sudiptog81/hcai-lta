thus, appears to be correct.
34\. We may notice that the concept of aspects theory whcih had found echoes
in State of U.P. Another v. Union of India & Anr. [(2003) 3 SCC 239] has
expressly been overruled by a Three Judge Bench in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.
(supra) stating :
78. But if there are no deliverable goods in existence as in this case, there
is no transfer of user at all. Providing access or telephone connection does
not put the subscriber in possession of the electromagnetic waves any more
than a toll collector puts a road or bridge into the possession of the toll
payer by lifting a toll gate. Of course the toll payer will use the road or
bridge in one sense. But the distinction with a sale of goods is that the user
would be of the thing or goods delivered. The delivery may not be simultaneous
with the transfer of the right to use. But the goods must be in existence and
deliverable when the right is sought to be transferred.
79\. Therefore whether goods are incorporeal or corporeal, tangible or
intangible, they must be deliverable. To the extent that the decision in State
of U.P. v. Union of India held otherwise, it was, in our humble opinion
erroneous.
35\. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be
sustained. It is set aside accordingly. The Appeal is allowed. No costs.
