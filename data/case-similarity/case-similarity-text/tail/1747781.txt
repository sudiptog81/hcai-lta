only confined to the propriety and validity of the order of rectification of
the registration of trade mark made in favour of Respondent Company and it is
not necessary to address on the questions of infringement of trade marks,
passing off, defensive registration etc. In that view of the matter, various
decisions cited at the bar dealing with the likely prejudice to be suffered by
a trader or manufacturer enjoying registration of trade mark in the event,
similar or deceptively similar trade mark is allowed to other trader or
manufacturer in respect of similar goods or goods marketed through common
trade channel need not be taken into consideration for the disposal of these
appeals. As in the facts and circumstances of the case, the rectification of
the trade marks registered in favour of the respondent Company since allowed
by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks was valid and also justified, such
order in our view, should not have been interfered with in appeal. We,
therefore, allow these appeals, set aside the impugned judgments of the High
Court and restore the order of rectification passed by the Assistant Registrar
of Trade Marks, Madras. By way of abundant caution, it is expressly made clear
that we have not expressed any opinion on the claim of registration of the
trade mark "charminar" in favour of the appellant for quiwam and zarda being
manufactured and traded by the appellant. In the facts of the case, there will
however be no order as to costs.
