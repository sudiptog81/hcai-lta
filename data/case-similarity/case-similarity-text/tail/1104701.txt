the plaintiff. I have no hesitation in taking a prima facie view that the
defendants have adopted the mark HONDA deliberately with an intention of
creating a subtle association between their activities and that of the
plaintiff. The user of he trade mark HONDA by the defendants cannot be said to
be an honest and concurrent user, as claimed by them. the trade mark HONDA
being of global reputation, its user by the defendants is likely to cause not
only deception in the minds of ordinary customers but may also cause injury to
the plaintiff company. In this view of the matter, it will be necessary to
restrain the defendants from using the trade mark HONDA for their products
till the matter is decided on merits after trial. Accordingly, the defendants,
their agents, servants, stockists, shopkeepers etc. or any other person acting
on their behalf, are restrained from using the mark HONDA in respect of
pressure cookers or any other allied and cognate goods or any other trade
mark/marks, which are identical with and deceptively similar to the trade mark
HONDA of the plaintiff and to do anything which amounts to passing off their
goods as the goods of the plaintiff till the disposal of this suit. The
application is, accordingly, allowed.
51\. It is, however, made clear that my observations in this order are prima
facie in purport and are not to be taken as the final expression of opinion on
merits.
