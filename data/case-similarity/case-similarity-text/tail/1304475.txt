the appeal filed by the Bank, we do not find that the State Commission has
independently considered Bank's appeal. The State Commission dismissed the
Bank's appeal for the reasons given in its order dated 6.7.07 in connection
with the appeal of the builders.
55\. This Court is of the view that since the Bank has filed a separate
appeal, it has a right to be heard independently in support of its appeal.
That right has been denied by the State Commission. In that view of the
matter, this Court quashes the order  29 dated 26.7.07 passed by the State
Commission as also the order of the National Commission dated 4th April 2008
which has affirmed the order of the State Commission.
56\. This case is remanded to the State Commission for hearing on merits as
early as possible, preferably within a period of six weeks from the date of
service of this order to the State Commission.
57\. It is expected that the State Commission will hear out the matter
independently and give adequate reasons for its conclusions. We, however, do
not make any observations on the merits of the case.
58\. Both these appeals are allowed. No order as to costs.
