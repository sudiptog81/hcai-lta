higher rate than ordinarily he would have to pay if the addition of the wife's
or children's income to his own brings his total income to a higher slab. But
it may not necessarily be so in a case where the income of the former is not
appreciable ; even if it is appreciable, he can debit a part of the excess
payment to his wife and children. In short, the firm, though registered, would
be treated as a distinct unit of assessment, with the difference that, unlike
in the case of a registered firm, the entire income of the unit is added to
the personal income of the father or the husband 1000 as the case may be. This
mode of taxation may be a little hard on a husband or a father in the case of
genuine partnership with wife or minor children, but that is offset, to a
large extent, by the beneficient results that flow therefrom to the public,
namely, the prevention of evasion of income-tax, and also by the fact that, by
and large, the additional payment of tax made on the income of the wife or the
minor children will ultimately I be borne by them in the final accounting
between them. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the provisions of s.
16(3) of the Act impose an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental rights
of the petitioner under Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution. In the
result, the petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
Petition dismissed.
