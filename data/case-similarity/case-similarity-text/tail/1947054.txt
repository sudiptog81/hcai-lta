It was however, held that it was open to the Tribunal to find that the
particulars given in a petition were insufficient for trial. It is evident
that the decision of the High Court turned on the provisions of sub- s. (5) of
s. 90, which is identical to sub-s. (5) of s. 86 of the Act, but both these
provisions relate to allowing an amendment of the election petition subject to
such terms as to costs or otherwise with a view to furnish the particulars of
any corrupt practice. The decision of the 728 Madhya Pradesh High Court in
Hari Vishnu Kamath's case, (supra) is therefore distinguishable.
It must accordingly be held that the High Court was not justified in striking
out paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition acting presumably under Order
VI, r. 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 on the ground that the facts
stated therein were not sufficient to formulate a complete cause of action
under  s. 100(1) (d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 i.e.
due to non-disclosure of material facts.
In the result, the appeal succeeds and is allowed with costs. The judgment of
the High Court striking out the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 of the
election petition is set aside and it is directed to proceed with the trial
according to law.
    H.L.C.					     Appeal allowed.
