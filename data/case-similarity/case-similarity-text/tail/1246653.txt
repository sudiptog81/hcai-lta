146 also stated that: 'if litigants who persuade the court to overrule a bad
precedent are not themselves accorded the benefit of the new law would they
have sufficient incentive to litigate such cases so that bad law is not
perpetuated". It is, therefore, argued to extend the benefit to the successful
party in the case.
37\. Mohd. Ramzan Khan's ratio giving the benefit to him and companion
appellants was valid in law and not, therefore, per inquarium and was legally
given the reliefs. The contention of the counsel for the employees/Govt.
Servants that the denial of Ramzan Khan's ratio to the pending matters offend
Art. 14 is devoid of substance. It is seen that placing reliance on the
existing law till date of Ramzan Khan, the employers treated that under law
they, had no obligation to supply a copy of the enquiry report before imposing
the penalty. Reversing the orders and directing to proceed from that stage
would be a needless heavy burden on the administration and at times encourage
the delinquent to abuse the office till final orders are passed. Accordingly I
hold that the ratio in Mohd. Ramzan Khan's case (AIR 1991 SC 471) would apply
prospectively from the date of the judgment only to the cases in which
decisions are taken and orders made from that date and does not apply to all
the matters which either have become final or are pending decision at the
appellate forum or in the High Court or the Tribunal or in this Court.
