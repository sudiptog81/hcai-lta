owned by any particular person are used then the use of such names or marks
would not disentitle those persons from the benefit of the Notification. In
our view this Circular has no relevance at all to the facts of this case. In
this case admittedly there is an owner of the registered Trade Mark. Once the
Respondents use that Trade Mark or a part thereof they get covered by Clause
4.
9\. Reliance was also placed upon the authorities of this Court in the cases
of Vishnu Das Trading as Vishnudas Kishandas v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd.
Hyderabad and Anr. and Roche & Co. P. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner & Co. P. Ltd. .
These are cases dealing with alleged infringement of Trade Marks. The
principles laid down therein have no application while considering whether a
person is entitled to the benefits of the Notification or not. To be entitled
to the benefits of a Notification a person has to strictly comply with the
conditions of that Notification. If on a plain reading of the Notification the
benefit is not available then merely on basis of principles applied in
infringement cases benefit cannot be claimed.
10\. In our view the impugned judgment of the Tribunal is clearly erroneous
and unsustainable. It is accordingly set aside and that of the lower
authorities restored.
11\. The Appeals are accordingly allowed with no order as to costs.
