himself guilty of criminal contempt.
Coming to the question of sentence, it appears from order of the High Court
that the appellant had adopted a defiant attitude and tried to justify the
aspersions made by him even without thinking it necessary to apologise. Before
this Court also, the appellant has neither expressed any contrition nor has he
any repentance for the vicious allegations made against the learned Judges of
the High Court. But on the other hand, he has exhibited a dogged determination
to pursue the matter, come what may. A reading of his memorandum of grounds
and the written and signed arguments show that he was ventured into another
bout of allegations against the High Court Judges and persisted in his
campaign of vilification. His present conduct has aggravated rather than
mitigating his offence.

Therefore, having regard to the sentencing policy that punishment should be
commensurate with the gravity of the offence, we hold that the sentence of 2
months, imprisonment in no way calls for interference and accordingly the
sentence is confirmed.
For the reasons aforementioned, the Criminal Appeal is dismissed.
    N.P.V.					   Appeal dismissed.
