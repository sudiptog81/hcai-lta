appeal against the order of the Tribunal exonerating the abovesaid three. This
order of remand would not reopen the proceedings against those three.
Similarly, the Tribunal has held that the duty liability of the appellant in
spite of a finding of under valuation could not be re-determined by pegging
the value of the equipment at an amount over and above 21.2747826086 million
DM as this was the figure found by the adjudicating officer and not challenged
by the Revenue.
The amount of penalty levied on the appellant was reduced by the Tribunal to
Rs.4 crores which too has not been challenged by the Revenue. On hearing the
case after remand if the plea of the Revenue may find favour with the
Tribunal, the dutiable value of the equipment and materials shall not exceed
21.2747826086 million DM and the amount of penalty shall not exceed Rs.4
crores.
Shri Ashok Desai, the learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that
the Tribunal has also held, vide para 9 of its order, that the liability of
the goods to confiscation did not arise and that part of the order should also
be held to have achieved a finality. With this submission we do not agree. If
the Tribunal may find the equipments forming the subject matter of contract DM
302 to be under valued the legal consequences flowing from such finding may
follow. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. No order as to the costs.
