facts of a given case by examining the pleadings, the issues that had been
framed and the judgment that had been rendered thereon. If it is found after
such examination that the findings recorded was one which was not necessary
for the final decision in the case or that it did not constitute the immediate
foundation for the ultimate decision, such a finding cannot be regarded as a
finding on a matter which was directly and substantially in issue and no
question of res judicata would arise.
19\. We have, at the outset, set out the pleas that were taken by the parties
to the suits, the nature of the issues and the findings recorded by the Trial
Court on those issues. They clearly show that issue No.2 framed in O.S.No.5 of
1978 was wholly unnecessary, the issue framed also being faulty and not being
reflective of the pleas that had been taken by the parties. The finding on
that issue can by no means be regarded as being necessary and it is impossible
to regard it as constituting the immediate foundation for the ultimate
decision in the suit. No question of regarding the finding thereon as res
judicata would, therefore, arise.
20\. No other question was argued before us. We do not find any merit in this
appeal. The same is dismissed. The C.M.P. is closed.
