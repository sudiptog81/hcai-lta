of 20 acres of virgin forest to the appellant in presumed enforcement of the
order in O.A. No. 247 of 1979 and passing the necessary order nullifying the
original order. The fact that the High Court has chosen to review the earlier
order on the petition for condonation of delay in filing the first review
petition and then to exercise the power of review cannot be of any moment in
the light of the what we have stated. In any event, as we have indicated, this
is a fit case where we should clearly decline to exercise our jurisdiction
under Article 136 of the Constitution of India to come to the aid of the
appellant to secure to him the fruits of the fraud practiced by him on the
Forest Tribunal and the High Court. Thus, we find no merit in the argument
that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in setting aside the order
of the Forest Tribunal at this distance of time.
21\. We thus confirm the decision of the High Court and dismiss these appeals
with costs. We hope that this judgment will act as an eye opener to the Forest
Tribunals and the High Court exercising appellate jurisdiction in dealing with
claims, (obviously now they are belated claims) for exemption or exclusion
under Section 8 of the Act. It behoves the Forest Tribunals and the appellate
court to carefully scrutinise the case of title and possession put forward by
claimants as also the identities of the lands sought to be claimed, while
entertaining applications under Section 8 of the Act.
