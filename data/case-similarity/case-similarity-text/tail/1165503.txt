not to impose any penalty.
13\. As to the other part of the question, namely, whether the penalty in the
instant case was justified or not it appears that nowhere in the earlier
proceedings it was contended by the revenue that in the facts and
circumstances the penalty imposed was justified. The Tribunal has found that
facts were before the Income-tax Officer to support the assessee's case that
it was not in a position to deposit the tax on the basis of the self-
assessment. The officer soon accepted the assessee's request to make a
provisional assessment, and the assessee paid the demand on the basis of such
provisional assessment. The Tribunal has found that in the facts and
circumstances the penalty was not justified, which finding is not challenged
as perverse or based on no evidence.
14\. The revenue all along proceeded on the sole basis that penalty was
imposable in the instant case only by reason of the language of the section
and on no other ground.
15\. In this view of the matter we answer the question referred in the
affirmative and in favour of the assessee.
16\. There will be no order as to costs.
Deb, J.
17\. I agree.
