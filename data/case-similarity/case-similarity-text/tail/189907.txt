between the laws of the two countries, the stay of one of the actions may
deprive the plaintiff of some advantage which he is justified in pursuing.
Thus he may have a personal remedy in one country and a remedy only against
the goods in another; or a remedy against land in one State but no such remedy
in another. The rule ' therefore, is that a plea of lis alibi pendens will not
succeed and the court will not order a stay of proceedings unless the
defendant proves vexation in point of fact. He must show that the continued
prosecution of both actions is oppressive or embarrassing, an onus which he
will find it difficult to discharge if the plaintiff can indicate some
material advantage that is likely to result from each separate action. Each
case, therefore, depends upon the setting of its own facts and circumstances.
In the facts of the present case I am of opinion that no case for injunction
has been made out and the order of Ramamurti, J., dated April 12. 1968
allowing the application of respondent in no. 106 of 1968 should be set
-aside. I would accordingly allow the appeals nos. 1208 of 1969 and 1833 of
1969 with costs.
ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeals are
dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. Y.P.
