Secretary, Government of India, for reconstitution of CABE.
d) NCERT is constituted under the Rules. It also consists of ex-officio
members as well as representatives of Parliament and experts in the education.
Violation of Article 28 The NCFSE nowhere talks of imparting religious
instructions as prohibited under Article 28. What is sought is to have value
based education and for 'religion' it is stated that students be given the
awareness that the essence of every religion is common. Only practices differ.
There is a specific caution that all steps should be taken in advance to
ensure that no personal prejudices or narrow minded perceptions are allowed to
distort the real purpose. Dogmas and superstitions should not be propagated in
the name of education about religions. What is sought to be imparted is
incorporated in Article 51(A)(e), which provides "to promote harmony and the
spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending
religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce
practices derogatory to the dignity of women" And to see that universal
values, such as truth, righteous conduct, peace, love and non-violence be the
foundation of education.
In the result, this petition is dismissed with no order as to costs. Interim
relief granted by this Court stands vacated. IAs seeking intervention in this
matter stand disposed of accordingly.
