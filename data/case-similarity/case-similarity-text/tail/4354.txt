shareholders and, that being so, there is no reason to throw on the petitioner
the almost impossible burden of proving that there are other companies which
are in fact precisely and in all particu- lars similarly situated In any
event, the petitioner, in my opinion, may well claim to have discharged the
onus of showing that this company and its shareholders have been singled out
for discriminating treatment by showing that the Act, on the face of it, has
adopted a basis of classifica- tion which, by its very nature, cannot be
exclusively ap- plicable to this company and its shareholders but Which may be
equally appplicable to other companies 940 and their shareholders and has
penalised this particular company and its shareholders, leaving out other
companms and their shareholders who may be equally guilty of the alleged vice
of mismanagement and neglect of the type referred to in the preambles. In my
opinion the legislation in question infringes the fundamental rights of the
petitioner and offends against article 14 of our Constitution. The result,
therefore, is that this petition ought to succeed and the petitioner should
have an order in terms of prayer (3) of the petition with costs.
Petition dismissed.
