the order passed by the learned Trial Judge we wish to make it clear that our
aforesaid conclusion is not an expression of our opinion on the merits of the
controversy between the parties. Our disagreement with the view of the
Division Bench is purely on the ground that the manner of exercise of the
appellate power is not consistent with the law laid down by this Court in the
case of Wander Ltd. (supra). Accordingly, we set aside the order dated
09.10.2012 passed by the Appellate Bench of the Bombay High Court and while
restoring the order dated 13.04.2012 of the learned Trial Judge we request the
learned Trial Judge, or such other court to which the case may, in the mean
time, have been transferred to dispose of the main suit as expeditiously as
its calendar would permit with the expectation that the same will be possible
within a period of six months from the date of receipt of this order. The
appeal shall stand disposed of in terms of the above.
