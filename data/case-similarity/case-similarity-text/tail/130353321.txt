relates to a drinking water supply scheme for the residents of a scarcity
stricken municipality. The project is sponsored with the Central Government
assistance under its urban infrastructure scheme for small and middle towns.
The completion target of the scheme is September 2012\. Any interference with
the award of the contract at this stage is bound to delay the execution of the
work and put the inhabitants of the municipal area to further hardship.
Interference with the on-going work is, therefore, not conducive to public
interest which can be served only if the scheme is completed as expeditiously
as possible giving relief to the thirsting residents of Sendhwa. This is
particularly so when the allotment of work in favour of respondent No.2 does
not involve any extra cost in comparison to the cost that may be incurred if
the contract was allotted to the appellant-company.
21\. In the light of the above settled legal position and in the absence of
any mala fide or arbitrariness in the process of evaluation of bids and the
determination of the eligibility of the bidders, we do not consider the
present to be a fit case for interference of this Court. This appeal
accordingly fails and is hereby dismissed with cost assessed at Rs.25,000/- .
