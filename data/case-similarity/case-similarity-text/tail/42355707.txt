27\. Whether the buyer had made any enquiry as to the genuineness of the
license within his special knowledge. He has to establish that he made enquiry
and took requisite precautions to find out about the genuineness of the SIL
which he was purchasing. If he has not done that consequences have to follow.
These aspects do not appear to have been considered by the CESTAT in coming to
the abrupt conclusion that even if one or all the respondents had knowledge
that the SIL was forged or fake that was not sufficient to hold that there was
no omission or commission on his part so as to render silver or gold liable
for confiscation.
28\. As noted above, SILs were not genuine documents and were forged. Since
fraud was involved, in the eye of law such documents had no existence. Since
the documents have been established to be forged or fake, obviously fraud was
involved and that was sufficient to extend the period of limitation.

29\. In view of this finding the other issues raised by the respondent are of
academic interest.
30\. The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
