Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of Personnel and Training) and he
appealed to the Court not to overlook the practical side in the working of the
government where at times one department does not know what the other
department is doing. We do not propose to enter into a deeper scrutiny of the
notification. For our purpose, it would suffice to say that Section 14 of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, and Article 323A of the Constitution to
which the Act owes its origin, do not apparently contemplate a society being
brought within the ambit of the Act by a notification of Central Government.
Though, we guardedly abstain from expressing any opinion on this issue as the
present one cannot be an occasion for entering into that exercise. Moreover,
on the material available, we have recorded a positive finding that CSIR is
not a society "owned or controlled by Government". We cannot ignore that
finding solely by relying on the contents of the notification wherein we find
the user of relevant expression having been mechanically copied but factually
unsupportable.
For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR) is not the State within the meaning of Article
12 of the Constitution. Sabhajit Tewary's case was correctly decided and must
hold the field. The High Court has rightly followed the decision of this Court
in Sabhajit Tewary. The appeal is liable to be dismissed.
