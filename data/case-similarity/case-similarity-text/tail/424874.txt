article 286(2). Once that ban is lifted by the appropriate legislation enacted
by the Parliament the State in which the property in the goods passes would
also be entitled to tax such sale or purchase but not otherwise.
Save as above, I agree with the conclusions reached by my Lord the Chief
Justice in the judgment just delivered. I agree that the Bombay Sales Tax Act,
1952, and the rules made, thereunder except Rule 5(2)(1) do not contravene the
provisions of article 286, that Rule 5(2)(1) is clearly severable and can be
ignored, that there is no substance in the contention of Shri Seervai that
there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and
that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the
statute itself to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction
from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the Constitution from the
purview of taxation by the State.
In the result the declaration 'Made by the court below will be set aside, the
writ issued by it will be quashed and the State of Bombay will be prohibited
from imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on sales or purchases
which according to the interpretation put above on article 286 are excluded
from the purview  1129 of taxation by the State of Bombay. Each party will
bear and pay its own costs throughout.
Appeal allowed.
