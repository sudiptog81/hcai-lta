As far as M/s. J.K. Synthetics is concerned, their right to obtain benefits
under the scheme by reason of clause 4(b) was in any event provisional. The
undertaking given by this company was to the effect that the benefits of the
scheme were being availed at the risk of the company till the sanction was
granted by the Screening Committee. Since no sanction has been granted to the
company, the company was aware that its rights to the benefits under the
scheme were conditional and that it might be called upon to meet its sales tax
liabilities in the event sanction was not granted on its application.
In such circumstances it must be open to the State Government to recover sales
tax dues as it is entitled to under the RST Act allowing the respondent
companies to only keep such benefits as had been already availed of by then
upto 7th January, 2000 and thereafter at the rates specified and according to
the provisions of the scheme as modified by the corrigendum notification.
However no interest or penalty will be charged from the respondent companies
by the appellants on the differential amounts for the period the matter was
sub judice before this Court provided the respondent companies pay the
principal amount of sales tax within such time as may be specified by the
appellants in this regard.
We, therefore, allow the appeals and set aside the impugned decision without
any order as to costs.
