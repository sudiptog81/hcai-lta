In the present case, the predecessor companies/transferor companies have been
succeeded by the Appellants/transferee companies who have taken over their
business along with all assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc.
In view of the provisions of Section 170(1) of the Income Tax Act, the
Department is required to assess the  26 income of the Appellants after taking
into account the revised Returns filed after amalgamation of the companies.
11\. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we find that the learned Single
Judge had rightly allowed the Writ Petitions. We accordingly set aside the
impugned Judgment and Order dated 04.07.0219 passed by the learned Division
Bench, and restore the judgment dated 30.04.2019 passed by the learned Single
Judge. Accordingly, the Civil Appeals are allowed.
The Department is directed to receive the revised Returns of Income for A.Y.
2016­2017 filed by the Appellants, and complete the assessment for A.Y.
2016­2017 after taking into account the Schemes of Arrangement and
Amalgamation as sanctioned by the NCLT.
12\. Pending Applications, if any, are accordingly disposed of. Ordered
accordingly.
