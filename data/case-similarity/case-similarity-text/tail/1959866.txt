As regards the omission to include hiring charges the High Court has observed
that the Tribunal did not record any finding that such hiring was proved. The
Tribunal has in fact found that as regards some cars they were hired, while
others had been taken on loan, the money value for their use having been paid
by the first respondent which is tantamount to saying that he had to pay the
hiring charges. The matter has been dealt with in paragraph 29(d) of the
Tribunal's order and the entire evidence has been gone through. We are unable
to say that the finding of the Tribunal that the respondent No. 1 had omitted
to include in his return of election expenses the dinner and hotel charges is
a finding unsupported by any evidence. Reference may be made in this
connection to paragraph 29(f) of the 267 Tribunal's order which deals with the
matter in detail. On the whole our opinion is that the so-called apparent
errors pointed out by the High Court are neither errors of law nor do they
appear on the face of the record. An appellate Court might have on a review of
this evidence come to a different conclusion but these are not matters which
would justify the issue of a writ of certiorari. In our opinion the judgment
of the High Court cannot be supported and this appeal must be allowed. The
writ issued by the High Court will therefore be vacated. We make no order as
to costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
