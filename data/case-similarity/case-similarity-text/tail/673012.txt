of the law except when by reason of the construction placed upon the law a tax
is assessed and levied which is beyond the competence of the legislature or is
violative of the provisions of Part III or of any other provisions of the
Constitution.
4\. A mere misconstruction of a provision of law does not render the decision
of a quasi- judicial tribunal void (as being beyond its jurisdiction). It is a
good and valid deci- sion in law until and unless it is corrected in the
appropriate manner. So long as that decision stands, despite its being
erroneous, it must be regarded as one authorised by law and where, under such
a decision a person is held liable to pay a tax that person cannot treat the
decision as a nullity and contend that what is demanded of him is something
which is not authorised by law. The position would be the same even though
upon a proper construction, the law under which the decision was given did not
authorise such a levy.
My answer to each of the two questions is in the negative. By COURT : In
accordance with the judgments of the majority, Writ Petition No. 79 of 1959 is
dismissed, but the parties will bear their own costs. C. M. P. No. 1349 of
1961 for restoration of Civil Appeal No. 572 of 1960 is also dismissed, but
the parties will bear their own costs.
