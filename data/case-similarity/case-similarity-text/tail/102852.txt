case the existence of the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy
of representation and overall administrative efficiency before making
provision for reservation. As stated above, the impugned provision is an
enabling provision. The State is not bound to make reservation for SC/ST in
matter of promotions. However if they wish to exercise their discretion and
make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in
public employment in addition to compliance of Article 335. It is made clear
that even if the State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will
have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so
as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or extend
the reservation indefinitely.
Subject to above, we uphold the constitutional validity of the Constitution
(Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, the Constitution (Eighty-First
Amendment) Act, 2000, the Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act, 2000 and
the Constitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001.
We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of appropriate
States and that question will be gone into in individual writ petition by the
appropriate bench in accordance with law laid down by us in the present case.
Reference is answered accordingly.
