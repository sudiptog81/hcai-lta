power and hence, the appellate courts will usually not interfere with it.
However, the appellate courts will substitute their discretion if they find
that discretion has been exercised arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely, or
where the court has ignored the settled principles of law regulating the grant
or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. This principle has been stated by
this Court time and again. [See for example Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P)
Ltd. [1990] Supp SCC 727]; Laxmikand V.Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah [(2002) 3 SCC
65] and Seema Arshad Zaheer v. Municipal Corpn. Of Greater Mumbai [(2006) 5
SCC 282].
Applying the ratio of the above decision, we are of the view that 1st
Defendant has not made out any substantial ground for interference with the
well considered order of the learned single Judge and both the Appeals are
liable to be dismissed.
62\. In the result, both the Appeals are dismissed. Consequently, connected
M.Ps. are closed. No costs.
