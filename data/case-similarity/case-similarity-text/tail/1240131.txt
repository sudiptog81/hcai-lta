that the notification exempts certain articles when imported into India from
payment of duty under the Act. The import must be valid and in accordance with
the provisions of the Act. In the present case, it is the finding of the
Bombay High Court that the respondent-firm had imported diamonds of foreign
origin without a valid licence and that finding has become final. Therefore,
we agree with the learned senior counsel Sri R.P. Bhatt on this aspect. The
Tribunal, in our view, erred in holding that the situation was covered by the
case of Associated Cements Company (supra.) decided by this Court.
16) The other two issues which were argued by the respondent and the revenue
before the Tribunal and same was not answered since the Tribunal allowed the
assessee's appeal by extending the benefit of the exemption notification to
the respondent-firm. We are of the view that these issues now require to be
considered by the Tribunal. Accordingly, while setting aside the order passed
by the Tribunal, we remand the matter to the Tribunal to consider those issues
after affording personal hearing to both the parties. The appeal is disposed
of accordingly. No order as to costs.
