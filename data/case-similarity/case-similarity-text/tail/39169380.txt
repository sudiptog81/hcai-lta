`goods'".
[emphasis supplied] Mr. Sorabjee submitted that the High Court correctly held
that unbranded software was "undoubtedly intellectual property". Mr. Sorabjee
submitted that the High Court fell in error in making a distinction between
branded and unbranded software and erred in holding that branded software was
"goods". We are in agreement with Mr. Sorabjee when he contends that there is
no distinction between branded and unbranded software. However, we find no
error in the High Court holding that branded software is goods. In both cases,
the software is capable of being abstracted, consumed and use. In both cases
the software can be transmitted, transferred, delivered, stored, possessed
etc. Thus even unbranded software, when it is marketed/sold, may be goods. We,
however, are not dealing with this aspect and express no opinion thereon
because in case of unbranded software other questions like situs of contract
of sale and/or whether the contract is a service contract may arise. Before
concluding, it must be mentioned that before the High Court certain other
questions were also raised. However, those have not been agitated or pressed
before us.
In this view of the matter, we see no infirmity in the Judgment of the
authorities below or in the impugned Judgment. Accordingly, the Appeals shall
stand dismissed with no order as to costs.
