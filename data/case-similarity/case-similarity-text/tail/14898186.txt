has decided to dispose of the application for cancellation of design on
merits. The learned Counsel appearing for the parties have agreed before this
Court that mere pendency of the application before the Controller should not
be taken as a ground for adjournment of the interlocutory application pending
before the Delhi High Court.
Mr. Saha learned Senior Counsel submits that since the Delhi High Court is in
seisin over the matter, till the suit is disposed of by the Delhi High Court
the proceeding before the Controller may be stayed and the appellant shall not
seek an adjournment of the interlocutory application pending before the Delhi
High Court on the ground of pendency of the cancellation application. The
parties are in agreement that any decision in the suit by the Delhi High Court
would be binding upon the Controller and this Court also is of the same
opinion. Although the Controller is having the jurisdiction to decide the
validity of a design, if  3 challenged but having regard to the fact that a
prior proceeding between the parties touching on the same issue which is
pending before the Delhi High Court, the proceedings before the Controller
shall remain stayed till disposal of the suit.
AID No.6 of 2017, AID No.7 of 2017 and AID No.8 of 2017 stand disposed of. The
order of the Deputy Controller of Patents and Designs, accordingly, set aside.
