defendant certainly had notice of application of the plaintiff having been
filed against it in the year 1985 for cancellation of registration of the
copyright. The defendant should have been warned, at that stage, that the
plaintiff is not likely to accept the user of its mark by the defendant. If
the defendant continued to do business by using the impugned mark, it did so
at its own peril. The continued user cannot be set up as a defense under these
circumstances.
40\. As has already been noted, it is not in dispute that the mark which is
used by the defendants is similar, if not identical, to that of the registered
mark of the plaintiffs. There is, therefore, a clear breach of the plaintiffs'
rights under S. 28 of the Trade Marks Act. The plaintiffs are not guilty of
inordinate delay or acquiescence and are entitled to the interim relief of an
injunction.
41\. For the aforesaid reasons, I restrain the defendants by an interim
injunction from using the offending mark 'NATARAJ' and the device of Nataraj
or any similar mark or device which is an infringement on the plaintiffs
registered trade mark Nos. 260466 and 283730 in respect of stationery pins and
other stationery items till the final decision of the present suit.
42\. I.A. stands disposed of. Parties will bear their own costs.
43\. Order accordingly.
