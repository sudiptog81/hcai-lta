inconvenience to a particular party but the Court has no choice but to enforce
it giving full effect to the same. The legal maxim “dura lex sed lex” which
means “the law is hard but it is the law”, stands attracted in such a
situation. It has consistently been held that, “inconvenience is not” a
decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. “A result
flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A Court has no power to
ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from
its operation.” (See : The Martin Burn Ltd. v. The Corporation of Calcutta,
AIR 1966 SC 529; and Rohitas Kumar & Ors. v. Om Prakash Sharma & Ors., AIR
2013 SC 30) In view of the above, we are of the candid view that none of the
submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants is tenable.
14\. As the matters are squarely covered by the above referred to judgments,
these appeals are devoid of any merit. The cases do not warrant any
interference. The appeals are, accordingly, dismissed.
