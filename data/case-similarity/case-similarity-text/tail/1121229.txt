to High Court is also fortified by the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court
in the case of Baahir Khan v. Ranger, .
36\. The Apex Court, in Thakur Jugalkishore Sinha 's case (supra) though held
that Assistant Registrar functioning under Bihar and Orissa Co-operative
Societies Act is a Court subordinate to High Court for the purpose of Section
3 of the Contempt of Courts Act, has considered the expression 'Court' in the
light of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act and not from the point
of view of word 'subordinate Court' used in Section 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and, therefore, held that, "in our view, the sub-ordination for the
purpose of Section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act means a judicial sub-
ordination and not sub-ordination under the hierarchy of Courts under the Code
of Civil Procedure or Code of Criminal Procedure." We have already stated
hereinabove that the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, in Yashwantrao's
case, has considered the judgment of the larger Benches of the Apex Court
stated hereinabove and held that the Commissioner is not a 'Court' within the
meaning of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We have already
expressed our concurrence with the view of the Full Bench.
37\. We answer the reference accordingly and overrule the judgment rendered by
the Division Bench of this Court in Smt. Rajiyabi Cosman Sayi and Anr. v.
Mackinon Machinzie & Co. Pvt. Ltd., (supra).
