primary role only if the freedoms under Articles 19, 21 etc. are involved and
not for Article 14.
Finally, we come to the present case. It is not contended before us that any
fundamental freedom is affected. We need not therefore go into the question of
``proportionality''. There is no contention that the punishment imposed is
illegal or vitiated by procedural impropriety. As to ``irrationality'', there
is no finding by the Tribunal that the decision is one which no sensible
person who weighed the pros and cons could have arrived at nor is there a
finding, based on material, that the punishment is in ``outrageous'' defiance
of logic. Neither Wednesbury nor CCSU tests are satisfied. We have still to
explain "Ranjit Thakur, [1987] 4 SCC 611)".
In Chairman and Managing Director, United Commercial Bank and Others v. P.C.
Kakkar, [2003] 4 SCC 364 the rigid standards to be adopted when considering
the case of Bank officials were highlighted.
Aforesaid being the position, the decisions of the learned Single Judge on the
quantum of punishment and of the Division Bench regarding alleged violation of
the principles of natural justice cannot be maintained and are, therefore, set
aside. The inevitable conclusion is that the order of dismissal as passed by
the Appellant-Bank does not suffer from any infirmity. Appeal is accordingly
allowed, but with no order as to costs.
