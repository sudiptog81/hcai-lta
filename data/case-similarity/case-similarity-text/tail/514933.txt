undertaking to the Court to pay the respondents such loss that may be suffered
by them by reason of the injunction, as may be established at the trial. Here
again, accepting the figures put forward by the respondents, the ability of
the appellants to pay the same is not in dispute.
42\. Having regard to the discussion, in my judgment, the order under appeal
must be set aside both on principles of law and fact.
43\. Subject to the undertaking given by the appellants to the Court, which is
hereby recorded, to compensate the respondents for loss, if any, which may be
suffered by the respondents by not using the name OCUFLOX on their product,
the appeal is allowed and the order under appeal is set aside. The ad-
interimorder granted by the Learned single Judge on 18th December, 1996 will
therefore revive and will continue until the disposal of the suit. There will
be no order as to costs.
Devendra Kumar Jain, J.
44\. I agree.
45\. Stay of operation of the order is prayed for and the same is granted 4
weeks from date.
46\. Let a xerox copy of the judgment duly signed by the Assistant Registrar
of this Court be given to the parties upon this undertaking to apply for
certified copy of the judgment and or payment of usual charges.
