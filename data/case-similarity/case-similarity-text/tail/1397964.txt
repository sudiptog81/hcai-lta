It has been argued on behalf of the respondent No. 2 that the matters and the
issues involved in the present petition are not to be gone into in exercise of
this court's power under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. It is
correct that this court is not sitting as a court of appeal and cannot re-
appreciate evidence and examine factual matters. But, what I find in the
present case is that the Appellate Board has not even broached the subject of
distinctiveness and has been overly concerned with establishing the user of
the respondent No. 2 from the date it claimed in its application for
registration. This is not a case of re-appreciation of evidence. It is a case
where the Appellate Board has not examined any material at all with regard to
distinctiveness. In fact, it has not returned any finding with regard to
distinctiveness. A writ petition in such a situation would definitely be
maintainable. It would, however, not be appropriate for this court to examine
and determine the factual issues of distinctiveness. That is best left to the
Appellate Board. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the matter
is remanded to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board for the purposes of
considering the question as to whether the word AGGARWAL which, admittedly is
a surname, has acquired sufficient distinctiveness in relation to respondent
No. 2's goods to be registrable under the 1958 Act.
This writ petition stands disposed of. No order as to costs.
