75\. It is noteworthy that the present suit was filed by the plaintiff on or
about 7th March, 2005, this Court had issued summons in the suit and notice in
the application by orders passed on 10th March, 2005 and the defendant was
duly served with the same. The defendant first entered appearance in the case
on 3rd May, 2005. The application seeking cancellation of the registered
trademark GEODON and ZOLOFT of the plaintiff was filed by the defendant on
29th November, 2005. There is no dispute that the defendants have not sought
leave of this Court before filing the petition before the Registrar of
Trademarks.
76\. Furthermore, in the instant case, I have prima facie found against the
defendant on the pleas raised by it and consequently there would be no
requirement of taking recourse to the procedure stipulated under Section
124(1)(b)(ii). A contention has been raised that the rectification proceedings
are pending. The validity of the same would, needless to say, be an issue
raised by the present plaintiff before the Registrar of Trade Marks in view of
the mandate of Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the Trademarks Act and does not need
to be commented upon herein. The defendant before this Court has not satisfied
the requirement of law.
In this view of the matter, the present application is wholly misconceived and
is hereby dismissed.
