offered to double the deposit in 30 months, 2000 for 1000, 10000 for 5000,
they said. Another advertiser offered interest ranging between 30% to 38% for
periods ranging between six months to five years. Almost all the advertisers
offered extra interest ranging between 3% to 6% if deposits were made during
the Christmas--Pongal season. Several of them offered gifts and prizes. If the
Reserve Bank of India considers the Peerless Company with eight Hundred Crores
invested in Government Securities, Fixed Deposits with National Banks etc.
unsafe for depositors, one wonders what they have to say about the mushroom
non-banking companies which are accepting deposits, promising most unlikely
returns and what action is proposed to be taken to protect the investors. It
does not require much imagination to realise the adventurous and precarious
character of these businesses Urgent action appears to be called for to
protect the public. While on the one hand these schemes encourage two vices
affecting public economy, the desire to make quick and easy money and the
habit of excessive and wasteful consumer spending, on the other hand the
investors who generally belong to the gullible and less affluent classes have
no security whatsoever. Action appears imperative.
