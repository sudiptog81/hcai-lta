invests money therein, does not obviously have the balance of convenience in
his favour. At any rate, at this stage at least, we are satisfied that the
judgment of the learned Single Judge cannot be faulted on the ground of
balance of convenience also. Our attention is drawn to the judgment of
Kurdukar, J. dated 8th March, 1989 in Notice of Motion No. 1920 of 1988 in
Suit No. 2903 of 1986, Pepsico Inc. v. Express Bottlers Services Pvt Ltd. and
Anr., which was confirmed in appeal by the judgment dated 8th February 1991 in
Appeal No. 436 of 1989 by the Division Bench to which one of us (B.N.
Srikrishna, J.) was a party and we stand confirmed in our view.
12\. There are no other factors to be considered. We see no reason to fault
the order of the learned Single Judge granting ad-interim injunction.
13\. Though we have been drawn into discussion of some of the principles, we
keep all questions open for further debate since we are sitting in appeal over
an ad-interim order. The learned Single Judge would be entitled to take his
own view on the questions of law presented to him as our views were only prima
facie, tentative and intended to dispose of the present appeal against an ad-
interim order.
13\. Appeal dismissed.
14\. Parties to act on an ordinary copy of this order duly authenticated by
the Associate of this Court.
