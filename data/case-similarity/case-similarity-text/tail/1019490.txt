decree was in terms both for prohibitory and mandatory injunctions and was
capable of being executed under Sub-rule (5) of Rule 32 of Order XXI of the
Code. Since court below has failed to record any finding on the point that the
judgment-debtor had wilfully failed to obey the decree in spite of
opportunity, the judgment under appeal, suffers from an obvious infirmity.
23\. I would prefer to remit the questions left undecided by the court below
instead of ordering remand as, in my opinion the matter is already too old. I
order accordingly and remit the following two questions for finding to the
lower appellate court
1\. Whether the decree has been satisfied in terms of Clause 'Ga' of the
compromise as contended by the J.D.? Its effect on the execution proceedings?
2\. Was there wilful failure to obey the decree by the J.D.? If not, its
effect?
Parties will be entitled to lead necessary additional evidence, both oral and
documentary, on these questions only and, if necessary may also be permitted
to cross-examine the parties on their sworn affidavits already on the record.
The findings shall be returned within three months from the date of receipt of
the record by the court below. The record shall be sent down within two weeks
and the office will ensure that the appeal is listed for hearing immediately
after receipt of the findings.
