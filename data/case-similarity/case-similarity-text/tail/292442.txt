amount as dividend. Further, as pointed out by both the Accountant Member and
the President of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, neither the Bombay High
Court nor the Madras High Court, who had also an occasion to consider this
question, had any doubts that the liability to tax attached as soon as the
loan was taken from the company. For instance, in the Madras case of K.M.S.
Lakshmana Aiyar v. Additional Income-tax Officer, [1960] 40 I.T.R. 469 (Mad.)
it was observed that under Section 2(6A)(e) a loan or advance by a controlled
company to its shareholder would attract tax liability though such a loan
might be repaid subsequently even during that year. Again, the Bombay High
Court in Navnit Lal C. Javeri v. K.K. Sen, from which the aforesaid appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court, has observed as follows : "The tax is attracted at
the point of time when the said loan is borrowed by the members." We have,
therefore, no hesitation in holding that the liability to be taxed attaches to
any amount taken as a loan by a shareholder from the company at the moment the
loan is borrowed and it is immaterial whether the loan is repaid before the
end of the accounting year or not. The answer to the question referred must,
therefore, be in the affirmative and in favour of the department. The
applicants are to pay the costs of this application.
