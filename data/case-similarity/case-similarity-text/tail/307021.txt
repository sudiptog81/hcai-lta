learned brother Sarkaria. but I find myself unable to agree with the
conclusions reached by him. I am of the (view that Section 302 of the Indian
|Penal Code in so far as it provides for imposition of death penalty as an
alternative to life sentence is ultra vires and void as being violative of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution since it does not provide any
legislative guidelines as to when life should be permitted to be extinguished
by imposition of death sentence.
211\. I would therefore strike down Section 302 as unconstitutional and void
in so far as it provides for imposition of death penalty as an alternative to
imprisonment for life. I shall give my reasons for this view on the day on
which the Court reopens after the summer vacation.
ORDER
212\. In accordance with the majority opinion the challenge to the
constitutionality of Section 302 of the Penal Code in so far as it provides
for the death sentence as also the challenge to the constitutionality of
Section 354(3) of the CrPC, 1973 fails and is rejected.
213\. The Writ Petitions and other connected matters may now be placed for
hearing, in the usual course, before the Division Bench for consideration of
the individual cases on merits, in the light of the principles enunciated in
the majority judgment.
