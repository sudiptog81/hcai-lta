in -the matter of securing his release by his representation, but whether his
constitutional safeguard has been infringed. Preventive detention is a serious
invasion of personal liberty and such meagre safeguards as the Constitution
has provided against the improper exercise of the power must be jealously
watched and enforced by the Court. In this case, the petitioner has the right,
under article 22(5), as interpreted by this Court by a majority, to be
furnished with particulars of the grounds of his detention "sufficient to
enable him to make a representation which on being considered may give relief
to him." We are of opinion that this constitutional requirement must be
satisfied with respect to each of the grounds communicated to the person
detained, subject of course to a claim of privilege under clause (6) of
article 22. That not having been done in regard to the ground mentioned in
sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 2 of the statement of grounds, the petitioner's
detention cannot be held to be in accordance with the procedure established by
law within the meaning of article
21\. The petitioner is therefore entitled to be released and we accordingly
direct him to be set at liberty forthwith. Petition allowed.
Agent for the petitioner : Ganpat Rai.
