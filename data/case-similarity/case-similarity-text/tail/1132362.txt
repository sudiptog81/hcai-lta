8.Deep Chand Arya Vs. Kiron Soap 1981 Ptc 108
9.TOMCO Ltd. Vs. Hansa Chemical Ilr (1979) Ii Del 236 I have gone through the
decisions cited. I find nothing therein deterimental to the view taken by me
hereinabove.
(12) Learned counsel for the defendant has placed reliance on the cases of
Glaxo Vs. Samrat (supra) , Tata Oil Mills Company Ltd.. Delhi VS. Reward Soap
Works Air 1983 Delhi 236 and Everest Pictures Cicuit, Salem VS. S.
Karuppannan, .
(13) I am referring only to one case which is The Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. Vs.
Dr.Gajra's Monochem Industries 1988(1) Tmc 1. The plaintiff company had its
registered office in Bombay and Branch Office in Delhi. The suit was filed in
Delhi. Shri M.K. Chawla, J. has held vide para 8 that Section 62(2) of the Act
is an 'exception' and to that extent 'altering the principles laid down in
Section 20 of the Code.' (14) The averments made in the plaint, as it stands,
fail in conferring territorial jurisdiction on this Court. It is held that the
suit does not lie within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
(15) The plaint is directed to be returned to the plaintiff for presentation
to proper court. The suit and Ia be treated as stand disposed of.
