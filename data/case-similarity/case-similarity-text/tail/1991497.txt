ordinary popular connotation of the words "domestic animals" besides doing
violence to the spirit and structure of the clause. The use of the word "all"
preceding "domestic animals" does not make any difference. It only means all
domestic animals of the type mentioned therein - all of which are quadrupeds.
If birds are also included in the clause, the very purpose of giving the
illustrations disappears. Those words in the clause would become superfluous.
Such an interpretation ought not to be adopted except perhaps to avoid an
absurd result. For all the above reasons, we hold, in agreement with the High
Court, that the chicks sold by the appellants are not included within clause
(xxvi) of Rule 5(2) of the A.P. General Sales Tax Rules.
20\. It is brought to our notice by Mr Sorabjee that by an exemption
notification issued in August 1992, day-old chicks have been exempted from the
tax. May be so. The said circumstance is in no way relevant on the question at
issue. The exemption notification is also not placed before us. In fact, the
very fact of exemption shows the exigibility to tax under the Act. We have, of
course, not placed any reliance upon the said circumstance in deciding the
question at issue.
21\. For the above reasons, the appeals and review petition fail and are
dismissed. No costs.
