[7] [8] In its present form the clear and present danger test has been
reformulated to say that:
"The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a
State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation
except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."
Interestingly, the US Courts have gone on to make a further refinement. The
State may ban what is called a "true threat".
"'True threats' encompass those statements where the speaker means to
communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful
violence to a particular individual or group of individuals."
"The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a
prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and
from the disruption that fear engenders, in addition to protecting people from
the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. Intimidation in the
constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat,
where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the
intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death."
