away from Dubai and was in Europe in connection with his business. On behalf
of the appellants reliance was placed on the reply to the Show Cause Notice
wherein respondent No. 2 was described as the joint owner of the vessel. The
Tribunal rejected the contention urged on behalf of respondent No. 2 and has
observed that no independent evidence has been adduced to establish that
respondent No. 1 company is owned by any other person other than respondent
No. 2 and that it in the reply to the Show Cause Notice respondent No. 2 had
been mentioned as the owner of the vessel. The Tribunal has also referred to
the statement of Mohammed Yousef that he had received the telex dated August
16, 1983 from respondent No. 2 and has observed that the said statement
clearly established that respondent NO. 2 knew about the voyage of the vessel
from Karachi to Bombay. On that view the Tribunal upheld the penalty imposed
on respondent No. 2 under Section 112 of the Act. We do not find any infirmity
in the said view of the Tribunal. We are, therefore, unable to uphold the
contention of Shri Rana that the Tribunal was in error in affirming the
penalty of Rs. 3,00,000/- imposed on respondent No. 2 by the Collector.
In the result, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment of the High Court
is set aside and, while restoring the orders of the Collector and the
Tribunal, the Writ Petition filed by the respondents is dismissed. No order as
to costs.
