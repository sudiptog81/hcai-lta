learned advocate for the defendant that the plaintiffs are operating from a
stall and the defendant is operating from a restaurant and the food items sold
by the plaintiffs and the defendant are allegedly not identical/similar would
lend no assistance to the defendant.
The denials on the part of the defendant and his assertions to the contrary
are baseless and completely lacks in substance.
25\. In view of the above facts and circumstances I am of the view that the
plaintiffs have made out more than a prima facie case for grant of interim
reliefs. The refusal of interim reliefs will cause irreparable harm, loss and
injury to the plaintiffs which are incapable of being compensated monetarily.
The defendant has admittedly started his business by using the impugned
names/marks in January 2011. The defendant has not disputed the plaintiffs
assertion of prior user and proprietorship of the registered trademark. No
equities exist in favour of the defendant. The balance of convenience lies
entirely in favour of the plaintiffs. The Notice of Motion is therefore
disposed of in terms of prayer clauses (a) and (b).
However, to enable the defendants to change its present trade name, the order
passed herein shall come into operation after a period of two weeks from
today.
