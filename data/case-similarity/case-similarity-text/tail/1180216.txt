In view of the legislative background of the present case we are of opinion
that the imposition of the tax retrospectively from 1st July, 1963 cannot be
said to be an unreasonable restriction. We, therefore, reject the argument of
the petitioners on this aspect of the case, For these reasons we hold that the
Madras Urban Land Tax Act, 1966 (Act 12 of 1966) must be upheld as
constitutionally valid. We accordingly set aside the judgment of the Madras
High Court dated the 10th April, 1968 and order that writ petitions filed by
the petitioners should be dismissed. In other words C.As 21 to 23 are allowed
and C.As 46, 47, 125 and 274 are dismissed. There will be no order with regard
to costs of these appeals. CAs. 21 to 23 of '69 allowed.
R.K.P.S.
C.As. 46, 47, 125 and 274 of '69 dismissed.
