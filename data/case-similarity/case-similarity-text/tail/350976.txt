In the instant case, the High Court has not indicated any reason while giving
interim protection. Though, while passing interim orders, it is not necessary
to elaborately deal with the merits, it is certainly desirable and proper for
the High Court to indicate the reasons which has weighed with it in granting
such an extra ordinary relief in the form of an interim protection. This
admittedly has not been done in the case at hand.
While issuing notice on 7.7.2003, this Court had granted interim stay of the
impugned interim order. The respondent had entered appearance and we have
heard the learned senior counsel on either side. In the fitness of things,
taking into account the above circumstances, we dispose of the appeal with a
direction that the proceedings emanating from the show cause notice shall be
continued, but the final order passed pursuant thereto shall not be
communicated to the respondent No.1 (writ petitioner) without leave or further
orders of the High Court. The writ petition shall be disposed of on merits in
accordance with law. Any observation made in this appeal shall not be
construed to be expression of any opinion on the merits of the matter pending
before the High Court. Since the controversy is of a very limited as well as
serious nature, the High Court may explore the possibility of early disposal
of the writ petition. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated with no
order as to costs.
