directed subject to the appellant's depositing a sum of Rs.5,000/- towards the
legal expenses incurred by the respondent Pursuant thereto the amount came to
be deposited.
It is contended by Mr Dhruv Mehta learned counsel for the respondent, that
since the prescribed Authority and the appellate Authority under the Payment
of Wages act are not the authorities subordinate to the Administration
Tribunal, the O.A. is not maintainable. We find force in the contention. But,
nonetheless, the material question that arises for consideration is whether
the authority under the Payment of Wages Act has the jurisdiction under
Section 15 of the Act to compute back wages on promotion of the respondent as
Driver `C'. Admittedly, when the respondent had the relief in the suit by way
of declaration for promotion and the declaration having been given and become
final there in the respondent had not sought any relief for payment of back-
wages. Consequently, by operation of Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure the respondent is debarred to claim the relief of back-wages. The
authority under the Payment of Wages Act, therefore, has no inherent
jurisdiction in the matter to entertain the claim for payment of back-wages
and for grant of the order.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. The order of the authority under the
Payment of Wages Act stands set aside. No costs.
