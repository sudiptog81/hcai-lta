whom it is to be awarded has served for at least 18 years. The award in such a
case is in the form of an annuity and not land. The appellant had not put in
18 years of service but only service for 14 years. That being so, no such
award for meritorious service could have been granted to him. He could not
produce any record because he could not have been granted such an award in
view of the fact that he had not put in the requisite qualifying service.
Besides, his service could not have been regarded as meritorious as the record
of his service produced by Subedar Mohan Singh revealed that he had been given
punishments on as many as seven occasions, some of which were on charges such
as theft, insubordination, absentism, etc.
13\. On this evidence, as also on the evidence that was before the
Commissioner, it is clear that the appellant was not and could not have been a
recipient either of a gallantry award or an award for meritorious service. Nor
could he have been granted any land at Samundri in respect of which he had
claimed land here after partition. The Commissioner, therefore, was right in
cancelling the allotment made in his favour as also the permanent rights
acquired by him in consequence of that allotment. The High Court consequently
was right in refusing to quash the Commissioner's order and dismissing the
writ petition.
14\. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
