the subordinate Court to proceed on its own reading of the decision of the
Supreme Court and to hold, or even to suggest, that the High Court decision to
be contrary thereto. That the law declared by the High Court, right or wrong,
is binding on all Courts and Tribunals in the State, even without any
provision analogous to Article 141, is too obvious from its appellate,
revisional, supervisory and other jurisdictions over all Courts and other
authorities and no citation should at all be necessary for such an obvious
proposition. But still, as it is our habit to move in the world of law only on
the crutches of precedents, reference may be made to the decision of the
Supreme Court in East India Commercial Co. Ltd. .
9\. I have no doubt that in the case at hand, if the alleged adoption was
found to have taken place in fact and it was thus necessary to decide the
question as to the right of the widow mother to take in adoption, I, sitting
singly, would have also had to be governed by the decisions of this Court in
Sahebrao (supra) and in Vaijoba (supra) and by the gloss put by them on the
Supreme Court decision in Gurunath (supra) and not by my own reading thereof.
But since both the Courts below have held the adoption not to have taken
place, in fact, this aspect need not be pursued any longer.
10\. I accordingly dismiss this Second Appeal, but make no order as to costs.
11\. Appeal dismissed.
