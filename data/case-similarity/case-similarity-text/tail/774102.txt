5\. In our view, the principles laid down in above case fully apply here. As
earlier proceedings in respect of same subject-matter were pending
adjudication it could not be said that there was any suppression and the
extended period under Section 11A was not available."
On the ratio laid down in this judgment it must be held that once the earlier
Show Cause Notice, on similar issue has been dropped, it can no longer be said
that there is any suppression. The extended period of limitation would thus
not be available. We are unable to accept the submission that earlier Show
Cause Notice was for a subsequent period and/or it cannot be taken into
consideration as it is not known when that Show Cause Notice was dropped. If
the Department wanted to take up such contentions it is for them to show that
that Show Cause Notice was not relevant and was not applicable. The Department
has not brought any of those facts on record. Therefore, the Department cannot
now urge that findings of the Collector that that Show Cause Notice was on a
similar issue and for an identical amount is not correct.
7\. We thus hold that the extended period of limitation was not available. In
this view, it is not necessary to decide the second point. We leave the
question of law open to be decided in an appropriate case.
8\. Accordingly, the Appeal is allowed. The order of the Tribunal is set
aside. There will be no order as to costs.
