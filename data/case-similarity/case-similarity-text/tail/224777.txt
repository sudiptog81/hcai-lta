Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, as it then stood, merely instructed the
Food Inspector to send by Registered post copy of the Public Analyst's Report
to the person from whom the sample was taken within 10 days of the receipt of
the report. Quite obviously the period of 10 days was not a period of
limitation within which an action was to be initiated or on the expiry of
which a vested right accrued. The period of 10 days was prescribed with a view
to expedition and with the object of giving sufficient time to the person from
whom the sample was taken to make such arrangements as he might like to
challenge the report of the Public Analyst, for example, by making a request
to the Magistrate to send the other sample to the Director of the Central Food
Laboratory for analysis. Where the effect of non-compliance with the rule was
such as to wholly deprive the right of the person to challenge the Public
Analyst's Report by obtaining the report of the Director of the Central Food
Laboratory, there might be just cause for complaint, as prejudice would then
be writ large. Where no prejudice was caused there could be no cause for
complaint. I am clearly of the view that Rule 9(j) of the Prevention of Food
Adulteration Rules was directory and not mandatory. The decisions in Public
Prosecutor v. Murli Dhar 1977, Crl. Law Journal 1634 and Bhola Nath v. State
1977 Crl. Law Journal 154 to the extent that they hold that Rule 9(j) was
mandatory are not good law. The petition is dismissed.
