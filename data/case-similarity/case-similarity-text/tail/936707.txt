1975 retrospectively. Were the law as it is under the amendments introduced by
that Act, the High Court could not have held that the election is vitiated by
the two particular corrupt practices. In regard to the cross-appeal filed by
Shri Raj Narain, Shri Shanti Bhushan thought that a part of it escapes through
the crevices in the Act but I see no substance in that contention either. I
would like to add that the findings recorded by the High Court in favour of
Smt. Indira Gandhi are amply borne out by the evidence to which our attention
was drawn briefly by the learned Counsel for the parties. The expenses
incurred by the political party, together with the expenses incurred by her
are not shown to exceed t
695\. Finally, there is no merit in the contention that the constitutional
amendment is bad because it was passed when some members of the Parliament
were in detention. The legality of the detention orders cannot be canvassed in
these appeals collaterally. And from a practical point of view, the presence
of 21 members of the Lok Sabha and 10 members of the Rajya Sabha who were in
detention could not have made a difference to the passing of the amendment.
696\. In the result, I hold that clauses (4) and (5) of Article 329A are
unconstitutional and therefore void. But for reasons aforesaid I allow Civil
Appeal No. 887 of 1975 and dismiss Civil Appeal No. 909 of 1975. There will be
no order as to costs throughout.
