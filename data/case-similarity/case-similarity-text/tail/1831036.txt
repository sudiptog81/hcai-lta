decision to order or not to order a report. We do not therefore think it
necessary or desirable to foreclose a controversy like this by any general
observations and will leave any issue that may arise from it for trial and
adjudication by the election court.
Being not altogether certain of all the facts and circumstances that may be
made available, in the appropriate forum, it may be a premature exercise by
this Court even to lay down guidelines when there is no hide-boand formula of
rules of natural justice to operate in all cases and at all times when a
decision has to be made. Justice and fair play have often to be harmonised
with exigencies of situations in the light of accumulated totality of
circumstances in a given case having regard to the question of prejudice not
to the mere combatants in an electoral contest but to the real and larger
issue of completion of free and fair election with rigorous promptitude. Not
being adequately informed of all the facts and circumstances, this Court will
not make the task of the election court difficult and embarrassing by
suggesting guidelines in a rather twilight zone. As we find no merit in this
appeal, it is dismissed but, in the circumstances of the case, there will be
no order as to the costs in this Court.
    P.B. R.				   Appeal dismissed.
