process and would efficiently be administered by advocate Judges. The remedy
of appeal by special leave under Art. 136 to this Court also proves to be
costly and prohibitive and far-flung distance too is working as constant
constraint to litigant public who could ill afford to reach this court. An
appeal to a Bench of two Judges of the respective High Courts over the orders
of the tribunals within its territorial jurisdiction on questions of law would
as usage a growing feeling of injustice of those who can ill effort to
approach the Supreme Court. Equally the need for recruitment of members of the
Bar to man 862 the Tribunals as well as the working system by the tribunals
need fresh look and regular monitoring is necessary. An expert body like the
Law Commission of India would make an indepth study in this behalf including
the desirability to bring CEGAT under the control of Law and Justice
Department in line with Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and to make appropriate
urgent recommendations to the Govt. of India who should take remedial steps by
an appropriate legislation to overcome the handicaps and difficulties and make
the tribunals effective and efficient instruments for making Judicial review
efficacious, inexpensive and satisfactory. The writ petitions are disposed of
with the above direction, but in the circumstances with no order as to costs.
