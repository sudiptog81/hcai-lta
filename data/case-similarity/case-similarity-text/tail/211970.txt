him overreached himself and suffered penalty under the law.
The High Court relied upon certain cases and Mr. N.C. Chatterjee attempted to
distinguish them. The cases referred to by Mr. Chatterjee were The Queen v.
Barnardo(1), The Queen v. Barnardo(2), and Thomas John Barnardo v. Mary
Ford(3). We do not consider it necessary to refer to them because the
principles on which a person is released from private detention and custody
are well settled and also well known. The High Court can always order the
production of the body of a person illegally detained and can punish
disobedience of its order by attachment and commitment. There is neither doubt
nor complexity in this proposition, once it is held that the disobedience was
wailful. We pass no order in the other appeal but we hope that if Mahesh
renews the petition, the High Court will put him to strict proof of his
allegations regarding the age, the conversion of Kaniz Fatima and his marriage
with her and his lack of interest in her welfare for over three years before
ordering a second time that Kaniz Fatima be brought into Court.
