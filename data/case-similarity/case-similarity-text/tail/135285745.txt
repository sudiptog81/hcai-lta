damages are difficult or impossible to prove, the claimants would be entitled
to the liquidated damages if they were a genuine pre-estimate of the damage.
No material at all in this regard was produced before the arbitral award. MTNL
has not even asserted that it had suffered loss.
44\. The Arbitrator has not even examined the challenge by the FCL to the
encashment of the bank guarantees furnished by FCL to MTNL for other contracts
and permitting amount thereof to be applied towards liquidated damages claimed
by MTNL in the present case. In any case, keeping in mind the view taken by
the ld. Single Judge qua the Award of the liquidated damages for which these
two bank guarantees were encashed, there is no justification at all for
encashment of these two bank guarantees.

45\. In view of the above discussion, the judgment dated 11th April, 2017
passed by the ld. Single Judge cannot be assailed on any legally tenable
grounds.
Result
46\. The present appeal is completely devoid of merit and is hereby dismissed
with costs which are quantified at Rs.50,000/-.
