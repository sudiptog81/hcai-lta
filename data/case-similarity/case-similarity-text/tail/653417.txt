judicial tribu- nals within the limits of jurisdiction assigned to them by law
and torestrain them from acting in excess of their authority. These principles
are well settled and require no elucidation(1). Our conclusion, therefore, is
that article 136 of the Constitution does not contemplate a determination
given by the Industrial Tribunal.
(1) Rex v. Electricity Commissioners [1924] 1 K.B. 171; Board of Education v.
Rice [1911] A.C. 179.

Even assuming for argument's sake that we have got jurisdiction under article
136, the exercise of which would depend upon the circumstances of each case,
in view of the reasons which we have set out above, this is not an appeal
which, in our opinion, should be admitted even if we have the power to do so.
The result is that the preliminary objection succeeds and the appeal fails and
is dismissed with costs. PATANJALI SASTRI' J.--I entirely agree with the
judgment just now delivered by Mukherjea J. and I have nothing to add.
Appeal dismissed.
