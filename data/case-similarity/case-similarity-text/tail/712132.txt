dismissed.
11\. We have heard both parties and gone through the documents. It is an
admitted fact that the registration was obtained by the applicant in the year
1980. So they are the prior adopter and user of the mark 'DOLAR' in respect of
medicinal preparations. The respondent has copied the appellant's mark and
advertised his mark and encashing on the goodwill of the applicant's mark
which is existing in the market very long. The respondent obtained the
registration of the mark by adding the letters 'EN' to the applicant's mark
'DOLLAR' and using the same mark in the same field as medicinal preparation.
Both the medicinal preparations are used in different use.
12\. So there is likelihood of confusion and deception amongst the trade
channels and as well as the purchasing public. Also there is chance of adverse
effect if the medicines use if confused by the user. So we are of the view
that the registration of the impugned mark is hit by the provisions of Section
9, 11 and 18 of the Act. Hence we are of the view that the mark was registered
wrongly and the same cannot be allowed to continue in the Register of Trade
Marks.
13\. In view of the above, ORA 119/06/TM/AMD is allowed and the Registrar is
directed to remove the mark 'DOLAREN' under No. 810263 from the Register of
Trade Marks. However, there will be no order as to costs.
