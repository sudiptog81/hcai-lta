(supra). A line or a word in a judgment cannot be read in isolation or as if
interpreting a statutory provision, to impute a different meaning to the
observations.
Above being the position, we find no substance in the plea that there was non-
compliance with the requirements of Section 50 of the Act.
It was pleaded that the requirements of Section 57 have not been complied
with. There was no material placed either before the trial Court or the High
Court to substantiate such a plea. The grievance in this regard does not merit
any consideration, leave alone the impact of it on the guilt and conviction of
the accused.
Additionally, it may also be noticed that while giving statement under Section
313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short the 'Code'), the
accused did not say that he was unaware of his rights or that he was misled on
that account in any manner. On the contrary, in general and vague manner it
was only said that he did not know or he had no idea of the allegations.
Though that by itself is not sufficient to convict accused, in view of the
procedural safeguards required to be observed by compliance with the
requirements of Section 50, yet that is of some relevance in appreciating the
grievance, now sought to be ventilated. There is no infirmity in the impugned
judgment to warrant interference. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.
