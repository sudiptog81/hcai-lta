charges giving necessary particulars were issued to the appellant and the
appellant had filed a detailed written reply with reference to each one of the
charges. The record also bears out that the appellant has been heard through
his counsel and the complaint made that he was not given sufficient
adjournments for further hearing, in our opinion, would not constitute a
breach of the principles of natural justice. As has been noticed by the High
Court, the allegation of malafides having been answered by respondent No.4 by
way of an affidavit denying the same and the High Court having chosen to
accept the affidavit of respondent No.4, and rightly so in our opinion, we do
not find any material to differ from the said finding.
We have noted earlier that the scope of judicial review in matters of this
nature being restricted, the High Court had to consider the challenge to the
impugned order with a limited degree of scrutiny that was called for. We too
have considered the complaint within that limited scope in order to find out
the correctness of the allegation that the impugned order of the disciplinary
authority suffered from the vice of perversity, non-application of mind and
tainted by malice and having come to the conclusion that the report of the
enquiring authority cannot be faulted with on any of the grounds stated above,
we are unable to agree with the appellant. For the reasons stated above, this
appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. No costs.
