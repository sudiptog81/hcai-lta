said that the Fruit Order was validly issued under the Essential Commodities
Act. What we find in the present case is that there was nothing on record to
show if the appellants held the licence for the manufacture of the offending
beverage and if, as noted above, the first appellant was the manufacturer
thereof.
It is no comfortable thought for the appellants to be told that they could
appear before the court which is at a far off place in the Ghazipur in the
State of Uttar Pradesh, seek their release on bail and then to either move an
application under Section 245(2) of the Code or to face trial when the
complaint and the preliminary evidence recorded makes out no case against the.
it is certainly one of those cases where there is an abuse of the process of
the law and the courts and the High Court should not have shied away in
exercising its jurisdiction. Provisions of Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution and Section 482 of the Code are devised to advance justice and
not to frustrate it. In our view High Court should not have adopted such a
rigid approach which certainly has led to miscarriage of justice in the case.
Power of judicial review is discretionary but this was a case where the High
Court should have exercised it.
We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and
quash the complaint and proceeding against the appellants.
