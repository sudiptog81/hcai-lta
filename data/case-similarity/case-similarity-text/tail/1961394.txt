if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question
of law within the meaning of section 100 C.P.C.
(2) The trust known as Gangubai's Shri Datta Trust, situate at Solapur created
under the Deed of Trust dated 13th November 1941 at Exhibit 66, is a private
trust and is not a public trust. The properties of the said trust including
the income thereof were, at all times, the private properties of Gangubai and,
on the evidence that has come before us, they clearly appear to have been
treated as private properties of Leelabai.
(3) Since the dominant purpose of the trust was of a private nature and since
only 20% of its income was being utilised for the education of poor students,
maintenance of poor widows and for assistance to the poor in connection with
marriage or death, no case has been made out for registration of the said
trust in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950.
39\. In this view of the matter, there is no substance in this appeal which is
accordingly dismissed. In the circumstances however, there will be no order as
to costs.
40\. Before we conclude, we must record our sincere appreciation for the very
able assistance rendered by the learned Counsel S/Shri Kumbhakoni, Apte and
Tated.
41\. Reference answered.
