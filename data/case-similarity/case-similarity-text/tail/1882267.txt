impugned order passed by the Textile Commissioner and confirmed by the Central
Government imposing cut in the import entitlement by the respondents should be
set aside and quashed and that the Textile Commissioner and the Joint Chief
Controller of Imports and Exports be directed to issue to the respondents
import certificates for the total amount equal to 100% of the f.o.b. value of
the goods exported by them, unless there is some decision which fails within
cl. 10 of the Scheme in question.
The facts which give rise to. the other appeals are substantially the same as
the facts in Civil Appeal No. 885 of 1967, except that in four out of those
appeals the exporters had appeared before the Committee appointed by the
Textile Commissioner and had explained the circumstances in which the exports
were made by them. But it is common ground that the report of the 386
Committee was not made available to them and the Textile Commissioner, before
he passed the orders, did not call for their explanations. It must therefore
be held that enquiry in a manner consonant with the rules of justice was not
made in the case of those four exporters also.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed with costs. One heating fee.
    V.P.S.						     Appeals
    dismissed.
