to technological advances they might or would in course of time become
obsolete. We are, therefore, clearly of the view that the capital asset
acquired by the assessee, namely, the technical know-how in the shape of
drawings, designs charts, plans, processing data and other literature falls
within the definition of 'plant' and therefore a depreciable asset.
Counsel invited our attention to the decision in Commissioner of Income Tax,
Gujarat v. Elecon Engineering Co. Ltd., 96 I.T.R. 672, where the Gujarat High
Court has, after exhaustively reviewing the case law on the topic, held that
drawings and patterns which constitute know-how and are fundamental to the
assessee's manufacturing business are 'plant'. We agree and approve the said
view.

Having regard the aforesaid discussion the question framed A at the
commencement of this judgment is answered in favour of the assessee to the
effect that the payment of Rs. 1,60,000 made by the assessee to the foreign
collaborator was attributable wholly towards the acquisition of a depreciable
asset. We allow the appeals but in the circumstances direct the parties to
bear and pay their respective costs.
    S.R.					     Appeal allowed.
