further sum of Rs. 1000 before he could ask for redemption. No issue was
raised by the plaintiff as to his liability to pay the principal amount, the
only point at issue between the two parties being whether the mort­gagee could
claim the value of the improvements effected by him. The deposit into Court
was made by the plaintiff as the mortgagee refused to receive the amount and
redeliver possession of the property and the necessary documents. So this
admitted amount was deposited into Court to be paid to the mortgagee and there
was no question of requiring the mortgagee to bring back the money to Court in
the event of an adverse decision against him. We think it is an obvious case
which is covered by the proviso to Section 9 of the Amending Act 24 of 1950'
and hence the mortgagee-respondent can­not be required to refund any amount
which he had already withdrawn although it is in excess of the sum due to him
calculated with reference to Section 9 (A) (3). Agriculturists Relief Act and
the value of the improvements. The sum of Rs. 3400 withdrawn by the respondent
must be deemed to Include the cost of improvements. Hence the ap­pellant will
not be required to pay the value of im­provements separately. The result is
that the plaintiff is under no obligation to pay anything more to the
respondent and the latter will not be required to pay back any portion of the
amount which he drew out from the Court.
     11. In the result the second appeal is allowed as indicated above.    In view of the fact that the plaintiff is getting relief under an enactment which was passed since the filing of the second appeal, we do not think it necessary to direct the respon­dent to pay the costs of the appellant. The parties will bear their own costs in the Courts below also.
