refused to him. Since an aggrieved party can always ask for a mandamus if he
is treated unfairly, it is not open, by straining the Constitution, to create
an absolute and fundamental right to a passport where none exists in the
Constitution. There is no doubt a fundamental right to, equality in the matter
of grant of passports (subject to reasonable classifications) but there is no
fundamental right to travel abroad or to the grant of a passport. With all due
respect we say that the Court has missed one for the other. The solution of a
law of passports will not make things any better. Even if a law were to be
made the position would hardly change because the utmost discretion will have
to be allowed to decide upon the worth of an applicant. The only thing that
can be said is that where the passport authority is proved to be wrong, a
mandamus will always right the matter. In the present cases we found no valid
ground for the issuance of a mandamus. We had, therefore, earlier ordered the
dismissal of the petitions. ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the
majority a writ of mandamus will issue directing the respondents to withdraw
and cancel the decision contained in their letters dated August 31, 1966, and
556 September 20, 1966 and to forbear from taking any steps or proceedings in
the enforcement or implementation of the aforesaid decision and further to
forbear from withdrawing and depriving the petitioner of his two passports and
of his passport facilities. The petitioner will have his costs. R.K.P.S.
