25\. This Court notices that in order to determine whether the payment is not
sustainable, the AO has to first return a finding that the payment made is
excessive, under Section 40-A (2) of the Income Tax Act. If it is found to be
so, then the AO has to determine what constitutes the fair market value of the
services rendered and disallow the difference between what is claimed and what
is such value determined (as fair market value). Apart from the fact that no
such exercise was undertaken by the AO, the Court sees that the assessment
order went off into a tangent, in following a method that was clearly
inapplicable. The annual cap of `. 30 lakh payable to managerial personnel
applied to public limited companies, and not those such as the assessee. This
aspect was noticed by the CIT (A) who set aside the disallowance. The Tribunal
upheld that finding. Such view (of admissibility of similar consultancy
charges) is supported by several decisions, which have been noticed in the
detailed order of the CIT (A). This Court finds no valid grounds to interfere
with those findings, which are both sound and reasonable.
26\. In the light of the above discussion all the questions of law are
answered in favour of the assessee, and against the revenue. The appeals
therefore, fail and are dismissed.
