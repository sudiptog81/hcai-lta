of the Act as also Sub-Section (1) of Section 4. The expressions "by reason of
sale" or "in connection with the sale" contained in the definition of
'transaction value' refer to such goods which is excisable to excise duty and
not the one which is not so excisable. Section 3 of the Act being the charging
section, the definition of 'transaction value' must be read in the text and
context thereof and not de'hors the same. The legal text contained in Chapter
84, as explained in Chapter Note 6, clearly states that a software, even if
contained in a hardware, does not lose its character as such. When an
exemption has been granted from levy of any excise duty on software whether it
is operating software or application software in terms of heading 85.24, no
excise duty can be levied thereupon indirectly as it was impermissible to levy
a tax indirectly. In that view of the matter the decision in PSI Data Systems
(supra) must be held to have correctly been rendered. We, however, place on
record that we have not applied our mind as regard the larger question as to
whether the informations contained in a software would be tangible personal
property or not or whether preparation of such software would amount to
manufacture under different statutes.
For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in the appeals of the
Revenue which are dismissed accordingly. However, interlocutory applications
are allowed. No Costs.
