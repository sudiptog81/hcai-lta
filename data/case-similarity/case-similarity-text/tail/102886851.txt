entitled to use the mark Comfit always and that as long as the assignment
stands, the assessee was entitled to the benefit of small scale exemption. In
the case of Convertech Equipment (supra), the Honble Supreme Court has also
upheld the decision of the Tribunal that affixation of a brand name of a
foreign company otherwise registered in the name of the Indian company would
not be a bar to availing small scale exemption.
11\. We find that the Honble Supreme Courts decision in the cases of
Primella Sanitary Products (supra) and Convertech Equipment (supra) have been
rendered by the Benches comprising of three Honble Judges, hence, following
the ratio of these decisions, we hold that the appellant-assessee herein is
entitled to the small scale exemption. Hence, we set aside the impugned Order-
in-Appeal and restore the Order-in-Original. Consequently, the assessees
appeal is allowed and the Departments appeal for enhancement of penalty is
dismissed.
    (Operative portion of the order was pronounced 
    in open court on 2.5.2012)
