whole interest of the tenants must be adequately represented. The tenancy
rights which the appellants claim are no doubt based on the presumption under
s. 5 (2) of the Tenancy Act. But the relationship in respect of which the said
presumption would arise is a relationship of landlord and tenant, and this
relationship in the very nature of, things is one and indivisible. Therefore,
when a claim is made to evict the persons who allege that they are tenants the
whole of the landlord's interest must be before the was cited with approval
in- Jhinghan Singh Anr. etc. v. Singheshwar Singh & Ors. etc. , (supra). It-
does not, therefore stand on any different footing. hold, therefore, that the
learned Judges of the high court were correct in holding that at least F.A.
326 had not abated because of the failure to implead Nirsu Prasad Singh as a
respondent in F.As. 332 and 333 and it was open to the Court in F.A. 326 in
exercise of its powers under O.41, r. 33 to give all the appellants therein,
that is, the respondents in the appeals before this Court, the relief that the
appellants in F.A. 326 were entitled to. The plea of the appellants is,
therefore, overruled.
In the result the appeals are dismissed with costs, one set hearing fee.
V.P.S.
Appeals dismissed.
