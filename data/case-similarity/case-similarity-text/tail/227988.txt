building with members of his family and no one else. In the present case,
Madan Lal sat in the shop conducting the vegetable business on behalf of the
appellant. When he did so, it must be considered as an occupation by the
appellant. Our attention has been drawn to Smt. Keshar Bal v. District Judge,
Mathura and Ors., [1980] 6 A.L.R. 165, where a Full Bench of the Allahabad
High Court held that a "deemed vacancy" would arise within the meaning of s.
12 (1)(b) where a person other than a family member was found in the
occupation of a building. It does not appear that the learned Judges
specifically considered the full significance and scope of the expression
"occupied" in s. 12(1)(b). We are of opinion that when a person sits in the
premises and carries on a business on behalf of and for the original occupant,
it cannot be said that the original occupant has thereby allowed the
accommodation to be occupied within the meaning of s. 12(1)(b).
In our judgment, the High Court is wrong in holding that the case attracts the
provisions of s. 12(1)(b) of the U.P. Act.
Upon the aforesaid considerations, we set aside the judgment and order of the
High Court and restore that of the Prescribed Authority and the learned Second
Additional District Judge. The appeal is allowed with costs.
    M.L.A.					     Appeal allowed.
