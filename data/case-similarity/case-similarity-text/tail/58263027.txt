view of our conclusion, we direct the Election Commission to provide necessary
provision in the ballot papers/EVMs and another button called “None of the
Above” (NOTA) may be provided in EVMs so that the voters, who come to the
polling booth and decide not to vote for any of the candidates in the fray,
are able to exercise their right not to vote while maintaining their right of
secrecy. Inasmuch as the Election Commission itself is in favour of the
provision for NOTA in EVMs, we direct the Election Commission to implement the
same either in a phased manner or at a time with the assistance of the
Government of India. We also direct the Government of India to provide
necessary help for implementation of the above direction. Besides, we also
direct the Election Commission to undertake awareness programmes to educate
the masses.
62) The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid directions.
