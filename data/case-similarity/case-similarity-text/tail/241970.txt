appellant.
29\. It is stated at the Bar that Mr. Nandkishore J., Advocate appeared before
this Court on 8.03.2007 on behalf of the appellant but the same learned
Advocate had appeared for Respondent No. 2 before the court below.
30\. The very fact that the appellant and the said respondent have a common
Advocate also goes a long way to show that the said application must have been
filed at the instance of the appellants themselves particularly having regard
to the fact that Respondent No. 2 had transferred her right title and interest
in favour of the appellant herein.
31\. Furthermore, no construction could be raised in view of the order of a
Division bench of this Court dated 21.06.2007. In that view of the matter, in
our opinion, interest of justice would be subserved if the said order is made
absolute. We would, however, direct the plaintiff  Respondent No. 1 to
furnish security for a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs only) within
four weeks from date so that in the event, the suit is dismissed and in the
proceedings the appellants prove that she has suffered any damages by reason
of not being able to raise any construction from the date till disposal of the
suit, they may be suitably compensated therefor.
32\. The appeal is dismissed subject to the aforementioned directions with
costs. Counsels fee assessed at Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five only).
