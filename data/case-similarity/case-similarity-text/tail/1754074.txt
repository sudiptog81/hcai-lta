situations alleged to have been copied from the novel Alayazhi submitted by
the plaintiff and compared the same with reference to the scenes in the
original manuscript copy of Avalute Ravukal but we could not find any common
feature in the scenes or situations so as !o justify a conclusion that the
script of Avalute Ravukal is a colourable imitation of the novel of the
plaintiff Alayazhi.
29\. We are fully alive to the fact that mere introduction of some changes
here and there in order to disguise the attempt at plagiarism or interchanges
of relative position in which the principal actors stand to create an
impression that the story of the film is entirely different is not sufficient
to rule out the theory of colourable imitation. The safest test to determine
whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to find out if the
reader, spectator or viewer after having read or seen both the works can get
an impression that the impugned work or film is an imitation of the other. In
our opinion no prudent man who has seen the film and read the novel Alayazhi
will come with an impression that the former is an imitation of the latter. In
the circumstances we hold that there is no infringement of the copyright of
the plaintiff in making film 'Avalute Ravukal'.
In the result, there is no merit in the appeal and it is accordingly
dismissed. In the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.
