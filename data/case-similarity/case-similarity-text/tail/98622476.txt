sentence in other complaint case No. 237/1/08 (in Crl.Rev.P.162/2016) is yet
to start. Nominal roll further reflects that the petitioner is not a previous
convict and is not involved in any other criminal case. His overall conduct in
jail is satisfactory. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the
sentence order requires modification.
