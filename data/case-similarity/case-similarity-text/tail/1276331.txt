some principles should be specified, and these notified in the Gazette and
laid before the Houses of Parliament. It may be necessary from time to time to
specify new principles in view of the changed circumstances; these have again
to be notified in the Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament, in
order to be effective. So long as new principles do not come into operation,
by being specified by Government, and thereafter notified in the Gazette and
laid before Houses of Parliament, the previous principles last specified,
notified in the Gazette and laid before Houses of Parliament, will remain
effective. As, however, the principles specified in the letter of the 18th
April have not been notified in the Gazete, nor laid before Houses of
Parliament, and no principles appear to have been specified before or after
that date, cl. 4 of the order, as it now stands, must be struck down as void.
The petitioners are therefore entitled to relief only in respect of cl. 4 of
the order. We direct that an order be issued restraining the respondents from
enforcing cl. 4 of the Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, so long as principles
in accordance with law, are not published in the Official Gazette and laid
before the  393 Houses of Parliament in accordance with sub-s. (5) and sub- s.
(6) of s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. As the petition has succeeded in
part and failed in part, we order that the parties will bear their own costs.
Petition partly allowed.
