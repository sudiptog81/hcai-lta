Having given my anxious consideration to the case, I am of the view that it is
not possible to hold that the petitioner can be called an 'anti-social
element' as defined by section 2 (d) of the Act. The order of detention
impugned in this case, therefore, could not have been passed under section 12
(2) of the Act which authorises the detention of anti-social elements only.
Before leaving this case, I should state that a number of decisions were cited
before us in which it had been held that an order of detention based on a
criminal charge which is still to be tried may not be invalid and that an
order granting bail by a criminal court cannot be a bar to the passing of an
order of detention. But I have not found it necessary to deal with them here
as they would have become relevant only if I had been satisfied that the
petitioner was an anti-social element. Moreover the orders of detention
questioned in those cases were governed by the provisions of the statutes
under which they had been issued.

In the result, I quash the order of detention passed against the petitioner.
The petition is accordingly allowed. The petitioner shall be set at liberty
forthwith unless he is required to be in custody on some other ground.
    H.S.K.					   Petition allowed.
