"We cannot infer merely from the fact that the authorities decided to drop the
case under the Official Secrets Act and thereafter to order the detention of
the petitioners under the Rules that the order of detention was mala fide."'
In view of the above, we hold that the order for the detention of the
petitioner has not been shown to be mala fide."
We must for the same reasons hold that the order of detention made by the
District Magistrate in the present case does not suffer from the vice of mala
fide or colourable exercise of power.
These were the only contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner and since
there is no substance in them, the petition fails and the rule is discharged.
P.B.R.
Petition dismissed..
