will be open to the parties to exchange pleadings and file the same in the
Registry not later than 16th July 2007. Needless to observe that the Motion
will be considered on its own merits in accordance with the law.
32\. After the operative order was pronounced in Court, Counsel for the
Defendants submits that this Court be kind enough to grant limited stay of
operation of this order to facilitate the Defendants to take the matter in
appeal or for that matter to issue instructions to all concerned for abiding
by the ad-interim order passed today as the show is going on day-to-day basis.
It is not possible to accede to this request in view of the detailed reasons
recorded above. If the request was to be accepted, the Motion will become
infructuous inasmuch as the programme that is going to be telecast by the
Defendants is only limited till 10th June 2007 as per the statement made in
the affidavit. Besides, the programme displayed by the Defendants is only for
two to three minutes on any given day. Thus understood, no prejudice would be
caused to the Defendants if the stay is refused. On the other hand, if stay as
prayed for is granted, nothing would survive in the Notice of Motion though I
have granted ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clauses (a) and (b) for
reasons already recorded above. Hence, request for grant of stay is rejected.
33\. All concerned to act on an ordinary copy of this order, duly
authenticated by the Office.
