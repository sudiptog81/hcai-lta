complying with the legal provisions contained in Section 309 of the Code. Of
course, the High Court can monitor, supervise and give directions, on the
administration side, regarding measures to conform to the legislative
insistence contained in the above section.
We have no doubt that in this case a miscarriage of justice has occasioned due
to the failure of the trial court to comply with the mandatory directions
contained in the Code. Criminal justice cannot be allowed to be defeated
solely on account of inaction or lapses of the court in adhering to the
mandates of law. When the State of UP moved the High Court of Allahabad, in
this case, seeking leave to appeal, the above aspect should have been
considered by the learned Judges and set right the grave miscarriage of
justice occasioned on account of flouting the directions of law.
We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order of the acquittal
passed by the trial court. We direct the trial court to proceed with the
further examination of PW-1 and examination of other witnesses to whom the
court should issue process if so requested by the prosecution. (It is open to
the prosecution to produce such witnesses without bothering the Court to issue
summons to them). The case shall be disposed of after taking all the remaining
steps, in accordance with law.
This appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
