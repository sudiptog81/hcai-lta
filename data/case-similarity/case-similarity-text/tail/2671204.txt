of Civil Procedure. It was further held that any Tribunal or Authority,
deciding the rights of parties, will be treated to be a "court". Consequently,
benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act was allowed in that case. This
decision was followed by the Himachal Pradesh High Court in Shri Bansi Ram and
others. vs. Shri Khazana, AIR 1993 Himachal Pradesh 20. Applying the above
principles in the instant case, we are of the opinion that the Deputy
Commissioner of Labour (Appeals), which was an Authority constituted under
Section 41(2) of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, 1947 to hear and
decide appeals, was a "court" within the meaning of Section 14 of the
Limitation Act and the proceedings pending before him were civil proceedings.
It is not disputed that the appellant could file an appeal before the Local
Board of the Bank, which was purely a departmental appeal. In this view of the
matter, the entire period of time from the date of institution of the
departmental appeal as also the period from the date of institution of the
appeal under Section 41(2) before the Deputy Commissioner of Labour (Appeals)
till it was dismissed will, therefore, have to be excluded for computing the
period of limitation for filing the suit in question. If the entire period is
excluded, the suit, it is not disputed, would be within time. It was for these
reasons that we have allowed this appeal by our short order dated 28th of
July, 1998 for which the reasons are recorded by us in detail.
