have been effected as per the provisions and in accordance with the terms of
contract of the appointment order of the workman concerned as well as of the
provisions of the standing orders of the company and such transfers effected
cannot be termed as change in service conditions of the workmen. In that light
of the matter it was contended that the application for interim relief ought
to be rejected.
29\. We may sum up the propositions. For a Tribunal or Labour Court to
exercise powers under the expression incidental, it must:
(1) arise from the terms of the reference and must be incidental to answering
that reference and not an issue falling beyond or outside the terms of the
reference.
(2) the interim relief granted should be capable of being enforced under the
provisions of the I.D. Act (3) Complaint under Section 33-A can be entertained
only on an employer committing a breach of Section 33 and not an apprehended
breach or contravention.
30\. Considering the above tests, in our opinion, the learned single Judge did
not correctly address himself to the tests to be applied and in the light of
that, the Judgment dated May 2, 2003 is set aside and the Order of the
Industrial Tribunal is restored. Appeal accordingly allowed. No order as to
costs.
