the facts of this case, interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution. There
has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. The marriage is
a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to
settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes
suddenly erupt which often assume serious proportions resulting in commission
of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the
result that those who could have counselled and brought about rapprochement
are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case.
There are many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not
encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their
defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude
and in that process the parties lose their "young" days in chasing their
"cases" in different courts. The petitioner himself is a Scientist at the
Centre for DNA Finger Printing & Diagnostics, Hyderabad which is a prestigious
Institution of the country. In this capacity, he can be reasonably presumed to
be aware of the bio-diversity at the Cellular and Molecular level amongst
human beings without the "caste" having any role in the field of Human
Biotechnology. It was for these reasons that the Petition, being without
merit, was dismissed on October 4, 1999.
