corporation could have without importing any of its food products into his
country bearing that mark applied for registration of that mark as proprietor
thereof., prior to 1951 before the respondent company started using that mark,
it is difficult to hold that the respondent company had started using that
mark quite innocently and without any knowledge on its part about the same
being widely used by the petitioner corporation on its food products. On the
facts of this case and also in the interest of business morality, it is
impossible to exercise my discretion under sub-section (3) of section 12 of
the Act and order concurrent registration of the mark "Monarch" in favour of
both of the petitioner corporation and the respondent company.
(43) In the result, the petition is allowed. The order passed by the Joint
Registrar of Trade Marks on the application filed by the respondent company
for registration of the mark "Monarch" is set aside and the applications are
dismissed. The respondent company to pay the costs of the petitioner
corporation of the proceedings before the Joint Registrar of Trade Marks as
also of this petition and also to pay the costs of this petition to the
Registrar of Trade Marks. As far as the costs of this petition payable to the
petitioner corporation are concerned, they shall be taxed on the long cause
scale with two counsel.
