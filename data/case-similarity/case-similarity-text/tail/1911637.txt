limited only to the appropriate proportion of the income chargeable under the
Act forming part of the gross sums of money paid to the three non-residents
above referred.
(3) While the ITO was correct in the determination of tax under s. 195 in
respect of the payments made to M/s. Sacheron Works Ltd. in R.C. No. 204, he
was in error in determining the tax deductible under s. 195 in respect of the
gross sums of money paid to M/s. Charmilles Engineering Works Ltd., in R.C.
No. 203 and M/s. Oerlikon Engineering Company in R.C. No. 205.
27\. Based on our above answers, we hold that the Income-tax Appellate
Tribunal was in error in cancelling the orders passed by the ITO under s. 201
of the Act. While the order of the ITO passed in R.C. No. 204 concerning the
payments made to M/s. Sacheron Works Ltd., should be upheld in toto, the
orders passed by the ITO in respect of payments made to M/s. Charmilles
engineering Works Ltd. (R.C. No. 203) and M/s. Oerlikon Engineering Company
(R.C. No. 205) have to be modified in the light of our above findings and the
Tribunal shall do necessary modification while passing orders conformably to
our judgment under s. 260(1) of the Act.
28\. We, accordingly, answer the three references. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.
Advocate's fee Rs. 500 in each of the references.
