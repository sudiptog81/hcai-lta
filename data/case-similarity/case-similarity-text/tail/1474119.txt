Development, has a 'Tory' touch. Canonisation of laissez faire cannons by the
Court is to move cotinter-clockwise. Lord Sankey held the view that in the
field of constitutional Law, progressive and dynamic interpretation in the
light of political developments must dominate (see : British Coal Corporation
v. The King : 1935 AC 500). Lord Jowitt L.C. in Attorney General of Ontario v.
Attorney Gen. of Canada (1947 AC 503) affirmed the same approach "To such an
organic statute the flexible interpretation must be given that changing
circumstancesrequire and it would be alien to the spirit with which the
preamble to the Statute of Westminster is instinct, to concedeanything less
than the widest amplitude of power to the Dominion legislature under section
101 of the British North America Act."
Legalism has to yield when spacious issues arise. "Whatever the legal aspect
of the thing, there are moments when it is a feeble need to rely on," said
Nehru, in the Constituent Assembly (I Constituent Assembly Debates, p. 61).
There is another stark possibility the, Administration sliding back from the
progressive constitutional values to protect private interests; and then the
Court may be activate the 'welfare jurisprudence' of the Constitution by
appropriate commands.
