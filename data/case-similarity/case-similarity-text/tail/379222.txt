and natural justice. Therefore, second part of the proviso must mean the date
when either the award was communicated to the party or was known by him either
actually or constructively.
Aforesaid reasoning would not be applicable for interpretation of Section 28-A
because there is no question of issuing notice to such applicant as he is not
party to the reference proceeding before the Court. The award passed by the
Court cannot be termed as an offer for market price for purchase of the land.
There is no duty cast upon the Court to issue notice to the landowners who
have not initiated proceedings for enhancement of compensation by filing
reference applications; may be that their lands are acquired by a common
notification issued under Section 4 of the Act. As against this, under Section
18 it is the duty of the Collector to issue notice either under Section 12(2)
of the Act at the time of passing of the award or in any case the date to be
pronounced before passing of the award and if this is not done then the period
prescribed for filing application under Section 18 is six months from the date
of the Collector's award.
In this view of the matter, we do not think that the judgment rendered by this
Court in Tota Ram (supra) requires re-consideration In the result appeals are
allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is
quashed and set aside. There shall he no order as to costs.
