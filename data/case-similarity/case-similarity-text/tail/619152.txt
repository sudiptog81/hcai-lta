the said freedom? It is impossible for him to express his real and intimate
thoughts to the visitor as fully as he would like. But the restrictions on the
said freedom are supported by valid law. To extend the analogy to the present
case is to treat the man under surveillance as a prisoner within the confines
of our country and the authorities enforcing surveillance as guards., without
any law of reasonable restrictions sustaining or protecting their action. So
understood, it must be held that the petitioner's freedom under Art. 19 (1)
(a) of the Constitution is also infringed. It is not necessary in this case to
express our view whether some of the other freedoms enshrined in Art. 19 of
the Constitution are also infringed by the said Regulation. In the result, we
would issue an order directing the respondents not to take any measure against
the petitioner under Regulation 236 of Chapter XX of the U. P. Police
Regulations. The respondents will pay the costs of the petitioner.
By COURT : In accordance with the opinion of the majority this Writ Petition
is partly allowed and Regulation 236 (b) which authorises "domiciliary visits"
is struck down as unconstitutional. The Petitioner would be entitled to the
issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondent not to continue
domiciliary visits. The rest of the petition fails and is dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs.
