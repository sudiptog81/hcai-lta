based its arguments on matters such as ouster of jurisdiction, over-riding
effect of special statute over general statute, over-riding effect of
subsequent statute etc. Since they have no application whatsoever to the
matter in issue, there is no need to refer various decisions in those aspects.
Ouster of jurisdiction arises only in regard to original jurisdiction and it
cannot have any application to appellate jurisdiction as the one provided in
Section 50 of the Arbitration Act. The appeal is a statutory remedy and it can
lie only to the specified forum. The appellate forum cannot be decided on the
basis of cause of action as applicable to original proceedings such as suit
which could be filed in any court where part of cause of action arises. In
such circumstances, we are unable to accept the lengthy arguments advanced on
the above-mentioned subject by learned senior counsel for the appellant.
Likewise, the submission of the appellant, namely, the Arbitration Act being a
special and subsequent statute has no relevance to the present case.
13) In the light of what has been stated above, we sustain the impugned order
of the High Court dated 21.02.2007 in F.A.O. No. 305 of 2006. Consequently,
the appeal fails as devoid of any merit and the same is dismissed. It is made
clear that the time taken by the appellant in pursuing their appeal before the
Delhi High Court as well as this Court shall be excluded for the purpose of
limitation. No costs.
