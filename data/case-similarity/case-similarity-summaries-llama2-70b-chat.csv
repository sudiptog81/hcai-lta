### Judgment Excerpt: corner was conceived by the respondent, he could not get it registered as a
new design as envisaged under Section 2(5) of the Act. Some thinking or mental
process has to be gone into while effecting even a small change/variation in
the existing design. When it is said that the design should be original or new
it does does not mean that it should be a copy or an immitation or a variation
of the existing design. It should be something likeinventive. By making the
corners from sharp to round, it cannot be said that some new design has been
created from ane's own mind and thought. 'New'would be something you develop
and which was not earlier in existence. It should be striking new design.
Round corner tiles may look fresh, but I would not say that there is any novel
idea involved in bringing out a tile with roundcorner.
(29) If I apply the law and the principles as enunciated in the judgments
referred to above, the design in question would merely be a trade variant of
the existing design of tiles with sharp corners and mottling effect. Both THE
designs are for all practical purposes the same. It cannot be said that THE
design which has been got registered by the respondent is something new or
original.
(30) I would, therefore, allow the petition and would cancel the designNo.

Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The court judgment is about a dispute over a design registration for tiles with round corners. The respondent had registered the design, but the petitioner argued that it was not original or new as it was just a variation of an existing design with sharp corners. The court agreed with the petitioner and canceled the design registration, stating that the design was not inventive or striking enough to be considered new. The court also noted that the design was merely a trade variant of the existing design and did not meet the requirements of being original or new as per the Act."

### Judgment Excerpt: Court dated 19.9.1991 on which the counsel for the respondent placed reliance,
does not lay down the correct law in view of the three-Judge decision already
referred to as well as the decision of this Court in Ranjit Singh's case. In
this view of the matter, we have no other alternative than to allow these
appeals and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court.""
7\. As per facts on record, the notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the
Act were published in the extraordinary gazetted of the State Government on
3.2.1978. After the said publication, the award was announced on 28.12.1979
and the compensation in terms of the award was deposited with the Land
Acquisition Collector vide cheque dated 22.8.1980. The dispute is regarding
taking over of possession by the Section on 20.3.1978. Even if the possession
has not been taken on the said date, the said fact is in consequential in view
of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to above wherein it has
been held that 1979 Instructions are contrary to the provisions contained in
the Act and will not amount to termination of acquisition proceedings even if
the possession is not taken within one year.
Thus, the judgment of the learned Single Judge is contrary to the law
enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and, therefore, the present appeal is
allowed and the judgment dated 4.3.1994 is set aside. Consequently, the writ
petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: trade mark, (1886) 31 Ch. D. 454, (involving the present ""Milk-Maid"" mark) and
distinguished it on the ground that the defendants in this case were not
selling condensed milk in tins or cans having the same size. type and shape as
are the tins used by the plaintiffs in packing their condensed milk; they are
dealing with biscuits and toffees which are not produced by the plaintiffs.
(48) In the above view it is not necessary to go into the further contention
raised as to whether the plaintiffs are entitled to use the word ""Milkmaid"" in
English separately when the registered trade mark is ""Milkmaid Brand"".
(49) We have only to reiterate what we have already stated that the question
whether apart from infringement of trade mark and passing off' the plaintiffs
are entitled to any relief on any other footing does not fall to be considered
in this appeal in view of the submission? before the learned single Judge
having been restricted to only two aspects. namely, infringement of trade mark
and passing off.
(50) In the result we hold that the plaintiffs have not made out any prima
facie case for the grant of the injunction sought for by them or for any other
allied relief pending disposal of the suit and that the learned single Judge,
with respect, rightly dismissed the plaintiffs' application for interim
relief. In the result the appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances without
costs. C. M454/72 is also dismissed.

### Judgment Excerpt: made on 27th November, 2004 i.e. after more than six years of communication of
the said order. Hence, it was clearly time barred.
16\. From the records, it appears that the appellate order passed on 31st
August, 1998 was communicated to the assessing authority vide Memo No. 2177
dated 5th November, 1998. The respondent obtained a certified copy of the same
in January, 1999. Memo No. 204 dated 6th August, 2003, as referred to by the
counsel for the State is the second time communication, which was only a
reminder. Thus, the appellate order having been communicated to the assessing
authority vide Memo No. 2177 dated 5th November, 1998 for the purposes of
limitation the period will start from 5th November, 1998 and will be complete
on 5th November, 2000 i.e. two years from the date of communication of such
order to the assessing authority. We accordingly hold that the assessment
order made after remand on 27th November, 2004 and the consequential demand of
notice raised in pursuance of such order of re- assessment, all dated 29th
November, 2004 are time-barred under Section 24 of the Bihar Finance Act.
17\. However, the contention of the respondent herein is that the assessment
should be directed to be completed on the basis that the rate of tax would be
8%. As at present advised, this Court need not go into the said question.
18\. Thus we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment. The appeal is
accordingly dismissed. No costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: goods by the recipient unit and their utilization. The Tribunal completely
overlooked the object and purpose of the procedure laid down in Chapter X. The
goods manufactured at the supplier end were excisable goods and if a party
wants remission of duty, he has to follow certain pre- requisities, the object
of which is to see that the goods be not diverted or utilized for some other
purpose, on the guise of the exemption notification. Detailed procedures have
been laid down in Chapter X so as to curb the diversion and misutilization of
goods which are otherwise excisable. The plea of ""substantial compliance"" and
""intended use"" is, therefore, rejected for the reasons already stated.

### Judgment Excerpt: the very basis of the claim.
We cannot allow the order of the Commissioner dated 19.3.199 to remain alive
even for a moment. It is the byproduct of fraud and cheating. We, therefore,
set aside the impugned judgment and restore the order passed by the
Commissioner on 11.10.1999. As already a long period of six years has been
wasted we direct the Commissioner to expedite the proceedings and dispose of
the claim without any further delay.
Before disposing of this appeal we deem it necessary to make one more
direction which, in our opinion, is required for completion of the even course
of justice. The Bar Council of the State of Haryana should hold an inquiry
into the allegations made by the petitioner against the advocate Rajpal Panwar
of Jagadhri as to whether he had played a chicanery to defraud the petitioner
by obtaining his thumb impression and paying Rs.9,500/-. We restrain ourselves
from making any observation on the merits of the allegations made against the
aforesaid advocate. We direct the Registry of this Court to forward a copy of
this judgment to the Secretary of the Bar Council of the Haryana. This is to
enable the said Bar Council to adopt such steps as they deem fit and necessary
for disposal of the disciplinary proceedings as against the said Rajpal
Panwar, Advocate, Jagadhri.

### Judgment Excerpt: expressed by the High Court on this issue, in the absence of any argument or
plea before it. The question whether public interest was involved or not
required a factual adjudication. Since there were no pleadings, the State did
not have an opportunity to indicate its stand. Under the circumstances, we do
not think it appropriate to consider that question for the first time in these
appeals, particularly, when factual adjudication would be necessary.
Coming to the plea relating to repeal of the Notification, it is to be noted
that the Notification dated 1.7.1995 was issued in exercise of powers
conferred under Section 9(1)(a) of the Taxation Act, while the impugned
Notification was issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 9(1)(6)
of the said Act. It is to be noted that originally Notification was issued
under Section 3 of the said Act and its operation has not been questioned.
That being the position, there was no requirement to issue a fresh
Notification to make the levy. Notification dated 1.7.1995, did not supersede
the original Notification issued under Section 3 of the Taxation Act.
In the result, the appeals are dismissed.

### Judgment Excerpt: to this Court by way of civil appeal under section 35-L(b) of the Act.
By judgment delivered by this Court today in the case of Commissioner of
Central Excise, Belgaum v. M/s Akay Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd. [Civil Appeal
Nos.3792-3803 of 2000], this Court has partly allowed the department's appeal.
However, the order of remand on the question of ""related person"" during the
period 4/91 to 3/93 has been upheld.
In the present appeal, 11 show-cause notices were issued by the department
calling upon the assessee as to why the deduction in respect of the above
seven items should not be disallowed for the period 4/93 to 6/97. Since the
question of ""related person"" had been remanded to Commissioner (Appeals) by
the tribunal under its earlier order dated 6.1.2000, the dispute on the same
point of ""related person"" for the period 4/93 to 6/97 was also required to be
remanded to the Commissioner (Appeals). In the circumstances, we do not find
any infirmity in the impugned judgment.
Before concluding, we may point out that in the case of Commissioner of
Central Excise, Belgaum v. Akay Cosmetics (P) Limited reported in 2004 (167)
ELT 253(T), it has been held that on and after 1.4.1991, the two entities,
namely M/s Akay Cosmetics (P) Ltd. and M/s Nemaru were not related persons.
For the aforestated reasons, there is no merit in this civil appeal and the
same is accordingly dismissed, with no order as to costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: enforced does not arise from a contract to which the unregistered firm is a
party, or is not entered into in connection with the business of the
unregistered firm with a third party, the bar of Section 69(2) will not apply.
In the instant case the contract was entered into with the respondent firm by
the erstwhile proprietor of the concern namely Purushottam. The partnership
firm came into existence later. The amount claimed in the suit were due to the
proprietor Purushottam who carried on his proprietary business in the name and
style of ""Dinesh Paper Mart"". When he entered into partnership with others, he
contributed to the partnership by way of his contribution to the capital, all
the assets and liabilities of his erstwhile proprietary concern. Thus, though
the partnership firm, which was unregistered, became entitled to enforce the
contractual obligation of the defendant firm which it owed to Purushottam, the
contract was not one entered into by the unregistered firm with a third party,
nor was it one entered into by the unregistered firm in the course of its
business dealings with the defendants. So viewed, the bar of Section 69(2)
cannot apply to the suit filed by the Plaintiff  appellants.
We, therefore, allow this appeal with costs and set aside the impugned
judgment and decree of the High Court and restore that of the Third Joint
Civil Judge (Senior Division) Nagpur, in Civil Suit No.52 of 1980 dated
29.4.1987.

The case involves a contractual dispute between a registered firm and an unregistered firm. The unregistered firm had entered into a contract with the respondent firm, but the contract was not registered. The court ruled that the bar of Section 69(2) of the Indian Contract Act, which prohibits the enforcement of an unregistered contract, does not apply in this case. The court found that the contract was not entered into by the unregistered firm with a third party, nor was it entered into in the course of its business dealings with the defendants.

### Judgment Excerpt: loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. Jagannath was working as
a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction
on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the
registered release deed (Exhibit B-1S) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding
the property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total
decretal amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these
facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that
he had purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal
Sowcar. Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the
trial tantamounts to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the
observations of the High Court that the appellants-defendants could have
easily produced the certified registered copy of Exhibit B-15 and non-suited
the plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all
the documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
he would he guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite
party.
9\. We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the
High Court and restore that of the trial court. The appellants shall be
entitled to their costs which we quantify as Rs. 11,000.

The court found that the appellants had withheld a vital document, a registered release deed, which showed that the property was actually purchased on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. The court held that this was a case of fraud and that the appellants had intended to deceive the court and gain an advantage.

on both the counts does not validate the caste certificate and the consequent
illegal appointment.
17.We are also unable to persuade ourselves to agree with learned counsel for
the employee that in the absence of any finding of fraud having been played by
the employee, the order of the High Court is equitable and should not be
interfered with. As noted above, the selection of the employee was  1 3
conceived in deceit and, therefore, could not be saved by equitable
considerations.
18.In view of the aforegoing discussion, the impugned judgment and order
quashing the order of termination of service of the employee and directing her
reinstatement cannot be sustained. The order of termination based on the
report of the Scrutiny Committee does not suffer from any infirmity and the

Thus, the defendants' works can be said to be ‗transformative', amounting to
―review‖ under Section 52 (1) (a) (ii) of the Act. Here, the term ―review‖ has
to be interpreted in the context. The plaintiffs claim to copyright is
premised the work being a ―literary‖ one. The review - or commentary, of a
part of such mathematical work - too would have to be seen in the background
of this claim.
38\. ―Review‖ according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Fifth edition) means
―view, inspect or examine a second time or again..‖ In the context of a
mathematical work a review could involve re-examination or a treatise on the
subject. In that sense, the defendants' revisiting the questions, and
assisting the students to solve then, by providing the ―step by step‖
reasoning prima facie amounts to a review, thus falling within the ―fair
dealing‖ provision of Section 52 (1) (a) (ii) of the Act.

13\. As to the other part of the question, namely, whether the penalty in the
instant case was justified or not it appears that nowhere in the earlier
proceedings it was contended by the revenue that in the facts and
circumstances the penalty imposed was justified. The Tribunal has found that
facts were before the Income-tax Officer to support the assessee's case that
it was not in a position to deposit the tax on the basis of the self-
assessment. The officer soon accepted the assessee's request to make a
provisional assessment, and the assessee paid the demand on the basis of such
provisional assessment. The Tribunal has found that in the facts and
circumstances the penalty was not justified, which finding is not challenged
as perverse or based on no evidence.

### Judgment Excerpt: [7] [8] In its present form the clear and present danger test has been
reformulated to say that:
""The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a
State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation
except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.""
Interestingly, the US Courts have gone on to make a further refinement. The
State may ban what is called a ""true threat"".
""'True threats' encompass those statements where the speaker means to
communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful
violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.""
""The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a
prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and
from the disruption that fear engenders, in addition to protecting people from
the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. Intimidation in the
constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat,
where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the
intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.""

Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The judgment excerpt provided is from the case of Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). The case involved the conviction of a Klansman, Brandenburg, who was charged with violating a state statute that made it illegal to advocate for the use of force or violence to achieve political or social change. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned Brandenburg's conviction, ruling that the First Amendment protects even hate speech, as long as it does not rise to the level of inciting imminent lawless action.

The Court established the ""imminent lawless action test,"" which holds that the government cannot prohibit the advocacy of the use of force or violation of law unless it is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. The Court also recognized the concept of ""true threats,"" which are statements that convey a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence against a particular individual or group, and are prohibited under the First Amendment.

In summary, the Brandenburg decision expanded the protection of free speech under the First Amendment, establishing that even hate speech is protected unless it incites imminent lawless action or constitutes a true threat."

### Judgment Excerpt: Ministers should do in a particular event. The Central Government which
advises the President is the best Judge of facts to decide as to what course
should be adopted in a particular case, namely, whether the Legis- lative
Assembly should be prorogued or should be dissolved and it is open to the
President to take any of these two actions and if he prefers one to the other,
this matter is beyond judicial review. For these reasons, therefore, I am
clearly of the opinion that Art. 356 does not contain any express or implied
limitations on the nature or functions of the Governor which are to be
exercised by the President under Art. 356(1) (a)..
I generally agree with my Lord the Chief Justice on the other points lucidly
discussed by him, except with regard to his observations regarding the theory
of the basic structure of the Constitution on which I would refrain from
expressing any opinion, because the question does not actually arise for
decision in this Case.

evidence is almost over and but for a few more witnesses and some documents

cannot be said that there is no scope for apprehension in the appellant's mind
that his complaint may not receive adequate and proper treatment at the hands

circumstances, while reiterating our opinion that we have no doubt that Mehta,
J. acted fairly and impartially and without casting any reflection whatsoever
on the learned Judge, we would, following the well known dictum that justice
should not only be done but must also appear to be done, request the learned
Chief Justice of the High Court to nominate another learned Judge to take up
the matter from the stage at which Mehta, J. made the impugned order. We hope

of production of the applicant's/plaintiff's film is different from that of
the defendants they could have no objection for any benefit that would flow

### Judgment Excerpt: the exemption relating to purchase tax and confined the exemption from sales
tax to the limit specified in the proviso of the Notification. All parties
before us who in response to the Order of April 11, 1979 set up their
industries prior to 21.10.1980 within the State of Kerala would thus-be
entitled to the exemption 660 extended and/or promised under that Order. Such
exemption would continue for the full period of five years from the date they
started production. New industries set up after 21.10. 1980 obviously would
not be ,entitled to that benefit as they had noticed of the curtailment in the
exemption before they came to set up their industries. In the course of
hearing and in the written submissions furnished on behalf of the State it was
contended that the question as to which of the appellants are entitled to the
benefit should be left to the Sales Tax Authorities to decide. We are of the
view that once the law is settled, that part of the decision may be left to
the Departmental authorities and they may decide the question on merits in
appropriate proceeding in accordance with the law laid down in this judgment.
Each of the appeals is allowed. Parties are directed to bear their own costs

26\. We however agree that it is necessary to make a distinction in regard to
information intended to bring transparency, to improve accountability and  29
to reduce corruption, falling under section 4(1)(b) and (c) and other
information which may not have a bearing on accountability or reducing
corruption. The competent authorities under the RTI Act will have to maintain
a proper balance so that while achieving transparency, the demand for
information does not reach unmanageable proportions affecting other public
interests, which include efficient operation of public authorities and
government, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information and
optimum use of limited fiscal resources.
27\. In view of the above, this appeal is allowed in part and the order of the
High Court is set aside and the order of the CIC is restored, subject to one
modification in regard to query (13): ICAI to disclose to the first

Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The Supreme Court of India allowed an appeal in part and set aside the order of the High Court while restoring the order of the Central Information Commission (CIC) with a modification. The case revolves around the Right to Information (RTI) Act, and the court had to balance the demand for transparency with the need to maintain confidentiality of sensitive information and optimal use of limited fiscal resources.

The court made a distinction between information that aims to bring transparency and improve accountability, and other information that may not have a bearing on accountability or reducing corruption. It was ruled that competent authorities under the RTI Act must maintain a proper balance to achieve transparency without affecting other public interests.

In the specific case, the court ordered the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to disclose the standard criteria employed by it for moderation purposes, for the purpose of making revisions under Regulation 39(2). The court also modified the order of the CIC regarding query (13) in this regard."

### Judgment Excerpt: Notification issued thereunder do not suffer from the vice of excessive
delegation of legislative power.
We may at this stage refer to one other subsidiary argument urged on behalf of
the appellants. It is argued that because paddy and rice are not different
kinds of goods but one and the same, inclusion of both paddy and rice in
Schedule 'C' to the Act would amount to imposition of double taxation under
the Act. There is no merit in this contention also because the assumption that
paddy and rice are one and the same is erroneous. In Ganesh Trading Co.,
Karnal v. State of Haryana & Anr. arising under the Act, this Court has held
that although rice is produced out of paddy, it is not true to say that paddy
continued to be paddy even after dehusking; that rice and paddy are two
different things in ordinary parlance and therefore, when paddy is dehusked
and rice produced, there is a change in the identity of the goods. The above
decision follows the principle enunciated by this Court in State of Punjab v.
Chandu Lal Kishori Lal in which it was held that cotton seeds when separated
from cotton constituted distinct commercial goods different from cotton. The
above contention has, therefore, to be rejected.
In the result these appeals fail and they are dismissed. The parties shall,
however, bear their own costs. N.K.A. Appeals dismissed.

The appellants argue that including both paddy and rice in the same schedule amounts to double taxation. The court rejects this argument, citing previous decisions in Ganesh Trading Co., Karnal v. State of Haryana & Anr. and State of Punjab v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal, which hold that rice and paddy are two different goods with distinct commercial identities, and therefore, the taxation of both goods does not constitute double taxation.

### Judgment Excerpt: signed in all the relevant papers as Nalini and made the insurance company
believe that her name was Nalini, but the said , deceit did not either secure
to her advantage or cause any non-economic loss or injury to the insurance
company. The charge does not disclose any such advantage or injury, nor is
there any evidence to prove the same. The fact that Dr. Vimla said that the
owner of the car who sold it to her suggested that the taking of the sale of
the car in the name of Nalini would be useful for income-tax purposes is not
of any relevance in the present case, for one reason, the said owner did not
say so in his evidence and for the other, it was not indicated in the charge
or in the evidence. In the charge framed, she was alleged to have defrauded
the insurance company and the only evidence given was that if it was disclosed
that Nalini was a minor, the insurance company might not have paid the money.
But as we have pointed out earlier, the entire transaction was that of Dr.
Vimla and it was only put through in the name of her made minor daughter for
reasons best known to herself. On the evidence as disclosed, neither was she
benefited nor the insurance company incurred loss in any sense of the term. In
the result, we allow the appeal and hold that the appellant was not guilty of
the offence under 600 ss. 467 and 468 of the Indian Penal Code. The conviction
and sentence passed on her are set aside. Fine, if paid, is directed to be
refunded to the appellant, Appeal allowed.

### Judgment Excerpt: Reduction of punishment in a case like this is bound to have demoralizing
effect on the women employees and is a retrograde step. There was no
justification for the High Court to interfere with the punishment imposed by
the departmental authorities. The act of the respondent was unbecoming of good
conduct and behaviour expected from a superior officer and undoubtedly
amounted to sexual harassment of Miss X and the punishment imposed by the
appellant, was, thus, commensurate with the gravity of his objectionable
behaviour and did not warrant any interference by the High Court in exercise
of its power of judicial review. At the conclusion of the hearing, learned
counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent was repentant of his
actions and that he tenders an unqualified apology and that he was willing to
also go and to apologize to Miss X. We are afraid, it is too late in the day
to show any sympathy to the respondent in such a case. Any lenient action in
such a case is bound to have demoralizing effect on working women. Sympathy in
such cases is uncalled for and mercy is misplaced. Thus, for what we have said
above the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the punishment as
imposed by the Disciplinary Authority and upheld by the Departmental Appellate
Authority of removal of the respondent from service is upheld and restored.
The, appeals, thus succeed and are allowed. We, however, make no order as to
costs.


Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The court judgment is regarding a case of sexual harassment of a woman employee (Miss X) by a superior officer (the respondent). The departmental authorities had imposed a punishment of removal from service on the respondent, which was upheld by the Departmental Appellate Authority. The respondent had appealed to the High Court, which had interfered with the punishment and reduced it. The appellant (the department) had challenged the High Court's decision in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now set aside the High Court's order and upheld the original punishment of removal from service, stating that the respondent's actions were unbecoming of a superior officer and amounted to sexual harassment, and that any leniency in such cases would have a demoralizing effect on working women. The court also noted that the respondent's apology and willingness to apologize to Miss X came too late and was not sufficient to warrant any sympathy. The appeals have been allowed, and the respondent has been removed from service."

### Judgment Excerpt: facts of a given case by examining the pleadings, the issues that had been
framed and the judgment that had been rendered thereon. If it is found after
such examination that the findings recorded was one which was not necessary
for the final decision in the case or that it did not constitute the immediate
foundation for the ultimate decision, such a finding cannot be regarded as a
finding on a matter which was directly and substantially in issue and no
question of res judicata would arise.
19\. We have, at the outset, set out the pleas that were taken by the parties
to the suits, the nature of the issues and the findings recorded by the Trial
Court on those issues. They clearly show that issue No.2 framed in O.S.No.5 of
1978 was wholly unnecessary, the issue framed also being faulty and not being
reflective of the pleas that had been taken by the parties. The finding on
that issue can by no means be regarded as being necessary and it is impossible
to regard it as constituting the immediate foundation for the ultimate
decision in the suit. No question of regarding the finding thereon as res
judicata would, therefore, arise.
20\. No other question was argued before us. We do not find any merit in this
appeal. The same is dismissed. The C.M.P. is closed.

Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The court judgment is discussing the concept of res judicata, which means that a matter that has already been decided in a previous legal case cannot be re-litigated. The judgment states that in order for a finding to be considered res judicata, it must be a finding on a matter that was directly and substantially in issue and must constitute the immediate foundation for the ultimate decision in the case.

The court then examines the pleadings, issues, and judgment of a specific case (O.S.No.5 of 1978) and finds that issue No.2 framed in the case was unnecessary and faulty. The court determines that the finding on that issue was not necessary for the final decision in the case and did not constitute the immediate foundation for the ultimate decision. Therefore, the court rules that the finding on issue No.2 cannot be regarded as res judicata.

The court also states that no other questions were argued in the appeal, and therefore, the appeal is dismissed. The court closes the C.M.P. (Civil Miscellaneous Petition) and directs the II Additional District Judge, Pondicherry to take appropriate action."

### Judgment Excerpt: This presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far and cannot be carried
to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and
unknown reason for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile
and discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc. v. W. H. Ellis, (1897)
165 U.S. 150; 41 L. Ed. 666). There may be cases where improper execution of
power will result in injustice to the parties. As has been observed, however,
the possibility of such discriminatory treatment cannot necessarily invalidate
the legislation and where there is an abuse of such power, the parties
aggrieved are not without ample remedies under the law (Vide Dinabandhu. Sahu
v. Jadumony Mangaraj, [1955] 1 S. C. R. 140,146). What will be struck down in
such cases will not be the provision which invests the authorities with such
power but the abuse of the power itself.""
It, therefore, follows that s. 7 of the Act cannot be impugned on the ground
of excessive delegation of legislative power.
All the various contentions urged by the petitioners therefore fail and the
result is that the petitions filed by the petitioners before us must be
dismissed with costs. The State of Bombay which is the only respondent in all
these petitions will however get only one set of costs therein.
Petitions dismissed.

### Judgment Excerpt: It is feebly argued that the notification is bad as it amounts to a delegation
of essential legislative function. Assuming that there is delegation of
legislative function, the Act having laid down its policy, such delegation of
power, if any, is not vitiated at all, for the legislation by the delegates
will have to conform to the policy so laid down by the Act. Lastly a point is
raised that the notification is bad because it violates Art. 23 of the
Constitution. It is frankly stated by the learned counsel. that this point is
rather premature at this stage and that he desires to reserve his client's
right to raise it in future.
No other point has been urged before us and for reasons stated above the
appeals Nos. 455, 456 and 457 of 1957 are dismissed with costs. Appeals Nos.
656, 657 and 658 of 1957 succeed only in part, namely, to the extent that only
the word-, "" by way of redress or punishment "" occurring in the latter portion
of el. (10) will be deleted so that the latter portion of cl. (10) will read
as: "" and the action which in the opinion of the Commission should be
taken.................. to act as a preventive in future cases "" as indicated
above. We make no order as to the costs of these three appeals.

### Judgment Excerpt: where he was living as it was not possible for him to reside there with
stranger. The respondents in such circumstances cannot be permitted to take
advantage of their own acts and defeat the claim of the appellant in the suit
by saying that old cause of action under section 44 of the Transfer of
Property Act no longer survived in view of their taking possession. In such
circum- stances it is but just and necessary that a direction should go to the
respondents to undo what they have done with knowledge of the appellant's
rights to compel the purchaser or to deny joint possession.
These facts in our view clearly establish that not only a refusal to grant an
interim mandatory injunction will do irreparable injury to the appellant but
also balance of convenience is in favour of the appellant fox, the grant of
such injunction. In the result we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
the High Court and restore that of the trial court with costs in this appeal.
We may add that our observations on facts are not to be taken as binding at
the time of final disposal of the suit after trial. We also make it clear that
if the vendors desire to come and stay in the portion of the house which was
in their possession earlier, they may indicate it to the Court and the trial
court on such request will pass appro- priate orders in that regard.

### Judgment Excerpt: in an integrated process for weaving the same into fabrics. Although it has
been alleged that the yarn is obtained at an intermediate stage of an
integrated process of manufacture of fabrics, it appears to be not so. After
the yarn is produced it is sized and, 721 thereafter, subjected to a process
of weaving the same into fabrics. Be that as it may, as we have held that the
commodity which is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated process
of manufacture of another commodity, is liable to the payment of excise duty,
the yarn that is produced by the appellants is also liable to payment of
excise duty. In our view, the High Court by the impugned judgment has rightly
held that the appellants are not liable to pay any excise duty on the yarn
after it is sized for the purpose of weaving the same into fabrics. No
distinction can be made between unsized yarn and sized yarn, for the unsized
yarn when converted into sized yarn does not lose its character as yarn.
For the reason aforesaid, the judgment of the High Court is affirmed and this
appeal is dismissed. There will. however, be no order as to costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: effective control of the machinery even while the machinery was in use of the
contractor was that of the respondent company; the contractor was not free to
make use of the machinery for the works other than the project work of the
respondent or move it out during the period the machinery was in his use; the
condition that the contractor would be responsible for the custody of the
machinery while it was on the site did not militate against respondent's
possession and control of the machinery. It may also be noticed that even the
Appellate Deputy Commissioner, Kakinada in the order dated 15.11.1999 in
regard to assessment years 1986-87 and 1987-88 held that under the terms and
conditions of the agreement, there was no transfer of right to use the
machinery in favour of the contractor. Although it cannot be said that the
appellant was estopped from contending otherwise in regard to assessment year
1988-89, it is an additional factor and circumstance, which supports the stand
of the respondent.
In our view, no fault can be found with the order under challenge. In the
light of what is stated above this appeal has no merit. Consequently it is
dismissed directing the parties to bear their respective costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: foreign technical director, only that portion of the amount which is exempt
under s. 10(6)(viia) of the Act should also not be taken into consideration
for applying the ceiling under s. 40(c) of the Act. It cannot be on the entire
salary, remuneration or perquisite paid to the foreign director as the Central
Government has not applied its mind to the entire salary that was paid to the
foreign technician. The reasonable construction of s. 40A(5)(b) would be to
limit the allowance to the extent to which the exemption was granted by the
Central Government. Therefore, the Tribunal was correct in holding that in
determining the quantum of remuneration, it cannot be on total remuneration,
but the remuneration to which the remuneration was exempt under s. 10(6)(viia)
of the Act.

### Judgment Excerpt: the Drugs Act at all for its interpretation and the Schedule was thence to be
interpreted as it existed along with that self-containing definition in
Explanation I. In doing so, the position that ""Patent and Proprietary
medicines"" means ""any medicinal preparation"" which very ""Medicinal
preparation"" includes all drugs which are a remedy or prescription etc. as
defined in s. 2(g) of the Act. So a reference to the Drugs Act was still
necessary. No doubt this is an inclusive definition. To enlarge its deno-
tation a specific provision to include Ayurvedic prepara- tions containing
selfgenerated alcohol which are not capable of being consumed as ordinary
alcoholic beverages was neces- sary. That having not been done by the
Explanation itself, it was not permissible to include it by the Circular. The
Explanation I could not have been in conflict with the provisions of the Act
and the Circular could not have been in conflict with the Explanation, the
Schedule, the Rules and the Act.
In the result, we set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and
restore those of the Civil Judge decree- ing the suit. We leave the parties to
bear their own costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: in the interest of justice. It is so because different High Courts did not
have unanimous judicial opinion on the issue. Punjab and Haryana High Court
and the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court upheld the contention of the
employees with regard to applicability of Regulation 29(5) to the optees who
had completed 20 years of service while the Division Bench of the Calcutta
High Court and a single Judge of the Kerala High Court took exactly an
opposite view. The stance of the banks,  46 although found not meritorious,
cannot be said to be totally frivolous. We, accordingly, hold that the subject
employees are not entitled to interest on unpaid pension.
56\. The result of the foregoing discussion is that the appeals preferred by
the banks must fail and are dismissed while the appeals of the employees
deserve to be allowed and are allowed accordingly. The respective banks shall
now recalculate, within one month from today, the pension payable to the
concerned employees by giving them the benefit of Regulation 29(5). However,
the employees shall not be entitled to interest on unpaid pension. The pending
applications in these appeals stand disposed of. The parties shall bear their
own costs.

### Judgment Excerpt: In the view he took on the main question of infringement of copyright the
learned Judge Ramaswami, J. did not consider it necessary to discuss the
evidence on the question of damages because be concluded that the plaintiffs-
appellants were not entitled to any damages. It is unnecessary to call for a
finding on this question because at the conclusion of the hearing of the
appeal both sides agreed that in case we found for the plaintiffs on the
question of infringement of copyright the damages to which the plaintiffs
would be entitled should be Rs. 500; accordingly we hold the plaintiffs are
entitled to recover damages Rs. 500 from the defendants.
It is not permissible for the plaintiffs-appellants to ask for an account of
the profits made by the respondents, in addition to damages for infringement
of copyright. In the result, the appeal is allowed the decree and judgment of
Ramaswami, J. are set aside and the appellants are given a decree, for
injunction in terms of Clause (a) of paragraph 15 of the plaint, and also a
decree for damages in the sum of Rs. 500 with interest at 6 per cent per annum
payable from this date till recovery. All other claims made in the plaint are
refused,
12\. The appellants will be entitled to get their costs incurred during the
trial before Ramaswami, J, from the respondents. But there will be no order as
to costs in the appeal.

The court also granted an injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, restraining the defendants from further infringing on their copyright. The court refused all other claims made in the plaint.

### Judgment Excerpt: that the civil court had no jurisdiction.
8\. The learned counsel for the appellants, Shri R.B. Datar, however,
contended that the trial court as well as the first appellate court had
decided all the issues involved in the case in favour of the plaintiffs-
appellants and in case we come to the conclusion, as indeed we have come to,
that the jurisdiction of the civil court is not barred, the judgment of the
first appellate court should be confirmed and there is no need to remand the
case again to the High Court for deciding it afresh on merits.
9\. We are not inclined to accept the contention raised by the counsel for the
appellants. A number of issues were involved in the case and the High Court
has decided the case only on the ground of jurisdiction and no other point has
been dealt with. It will not be fair to the respondents to accept the finding
of the first appellate court without the same being examined by the High
Court.
10\. For the reasons given above the judgment of the High Court cannot be
sustained. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment of the High
Court is set aside and the case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the
other issues involved in the case on merits. However, this decision will be
without any prejudice to the respondents' rights, if any, under any other
enactment. There shall, however, be no orders as to costs.


Write a summary of this court judgment.[/INST]","  The summary of this court judgment is as follows:

The appellants (plaintiffs) had filed a case in the civil court, which was later appealed to the first appellate court and then to the High Court. The High Court had decided the case only on the ground of jurisdiction and not on other issues involved. The appellants' counsel argued that since the trial court and first appellate court had decided all issues in favor of the appellants, the judgment of the first appellate court should be confirmed. However, the Supreme Court did not accept this contention and held that it would not be fair to the respondents (defendants) to accept the finding of the first appellate court without the same being examined by the High Court. Therefore, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court, and remanded the case to the High Court for deciding the other issues involved on merits. The decision was made without any prejudice to the respondents' rights, if any, under any other enactment. No orders were made as to costs."

### Judgment Excerpt: manufacture and thereafter. In those circumstances, the views expressed in the
D.C.M. General Mills Ltd. (supra) and the passage from the American Judgment
(supra) become meaningful. The observation that manufacture implies a change,
but every change of not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the
result of treatment, labour and manipulation is apposite to the situation at
hand. The process Involved in the manufacture of sweetened betel nut pieces
does not result in the manufacture of a new product as the end product
continues to retain its original character though in a modified form.
31\. In our view, the Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise (Appeals) has
correctly analysed the factual as well as the legal situation in arriving at
the conclusion that the process of cutting betel nuts into small pieces and
addition of essential/non-essential oils, menthol, sweetening agent etc. did
not result in a new and distinct product having a different character and use.
3\. Learned SDR has acknowledged the apex court's decision.
4\. In view of the ruling of the apex court, we hold that the 'scented supari'
cleared by the assessee during the period of dispute was not excisable, there
having been no 'manufacture' in the activity performed by M/s. ARR
Enterprises. In the result, the impugned order is set aside and this appeal is
allowed.

### Judgment Excerpt: more than the sum of Rs. 16,500 shown to be the consideration for the property
in the Instrument of Transfer and there was understatement or concealment of
the consideration in respect of the transfer. It was common ground between the
parties and that was a finding of fact reached by the Income-tax Authorities,
that the transfer of the property by the assessee was a perfectly, honest and
bonafide transaction where the full value of the consideration received by the
assessee was correctly disclosed at the figure of Rs. 16,500. Therefore, on
the construction placed by us, subsection (2) had no application to the
present case and the Income-tax officer could have no reason to believe that
any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment so as to justify
the issue of a notice under section 148. The order of re-assessment made by
the Income-tax officer pursuant to the notice issued under section 148 was
accordingly without jurisdiction and the majority judges of the Full Bench
were in error in refusing to quash it.
We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the order passed by the Full Bench
and restore the order of Issac, J. allowing the writ 658 petition and quashing
the order of re-assessment made by the Income-tax officer. The Revenue will
pay the costs of the assessee throughout.
    S.R.				       Appeal allowed.

The court found that the transfer of the property was a bonafide transaction where the full value of the consideration received by the assessee was correctly disclosed, and therefore, the Income-tax officer had no reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment. The court held that the order of re-assessment was without jurisdiction and set it aside, restoring the order of the single judge bench which had allowed the assessee's writ petition and quashed the re-assessment order.

### Judgment Excerpt: lakes. After the Report is received, the matter may be listed. Point 6 is
decided accordingly. In the result, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of the
High Court and the order of the appellate authority under section 28 of the
Water Act, 1974 are set aside and the order of the appellant Board refusing
permission to the seventh respondent under section 25 of the Water Act is
restored. Before parting with the case, we acknowledge the excellent Reports
submitted to this Court by the three expert bodies on the basis of
scientific/technological research of a very high order. The amount of hard
work done by these three bodies is commendable. But for these expert reports
it would have been very difficult for this Court to resolve the complicated
scientific issues involved in this case, with confidence. It will be open to
the three expert bodies (1) National Environmental Appellate Authority, New
Delhi (2) The University Department of Chemical Technology (Autonomous),
Matunga, Bombay headed by Dr. Bhowmick and (3) The National Geophysical
Research Institute, Tarnaka, Hyderabad, to submit their list of expenses or
fee, if any, to the State of Andhra Pradesh, through the appellant Board. If
any claims for monies are made, the same shall be paid by the State of Andhra
Pradesh. Appeals are allowed as stated above. No costs. List the matter after
4 months, after the Report of the State of Andhra Pradesh as directed above,
is received.

### Judgment Excerpt: or a decision of the Court sanctioning something which is illegal, by resort
to the rule of res judicata a party affected by the decision will not be
precluded from challenging the validity of that order under the rule of res
judicata,for a rule of procedure cannot supersede the law of the land.
In the present case the decision of the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Borivli,
that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for determination of
standard rent, is, in view of the judgment of this Court, plainly erroneous :
see Mrs. Dossibai N. B. Jeejeebhoy v. Khemchand Gorumal & Others(1) If the
